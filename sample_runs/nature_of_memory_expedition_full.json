Instead, the regime has instigated a brutal crackdown on its own people leaving thousands of Iranian civilians dead.\n“A regime that relies on the repression and murder of its own people to retain power is without legitimacy.”\n“It has long been recognised that Iran’s nuclear program is a threat to global peace and security.”\n![Anthony Albanese supports the US decision to attack Iran.

It is also responsible for acts of foreign interference in Australia and igniting antisemitism.\n“Since 1979, the revolutionary Islamic government in Tehran has oppressed, imprisoned and murdered Iranians.

We've had reporting from the region, analysis from Washington and elsewhere. We'll continue; that's what you get from NPR News.\nOur next guest is Danny Danon, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, who's on the line. Ambassador, welcome back to the program.\nDANNY DANON: Good morning. Thank you for having me, Steve.\nINSKEEP: What, in Israel's view, justified an attack on another country at this time?\nDANON: Well, we obtained the information about a secret program that included all the necessary parts to put together a bomb. You know, we're talking about the uranium enrichment, the triggering mechanisms and the warhead delivery systems. And like you mentioned earlier, the IAEA decided and reported that Iran possesses enough material for multiple nuclear weapons. So we decided to take a preemptive action, preemptive attack and not to wait and not to be surprised. After October 7, we learned that lesson. We are not going to wait for our enemies to surprise us again. That's why we targeted the nuclear sites and also the industry of the ballistic missiles that Iran developed.\nINSKEEP: Well, let's talk about the information that you say you obtained about an Iranian secret program - the various components of a bomb. We will note that Iran always denies they have any ambition to build a nuclear weapon, although they insist that they have the right to a nuclear program. You are asserting that they had the capability together. Are you asserting that they were on their way to making a bomb or only that the secret program had the capacity to do so?\nDANON: No, moreover, we have the intelligence that it wasn't like nuclear reactors for civil usage. It was a military program that was hidden from the international community. And once we realized that, that they're playing the game and they're getting very close to the point of no return, we couldn't take that risk. You know, a few hours ago, they send more than 100 drones. We expect ballistic missiles to fly into Israel in the next few days. So we cannot wait for the day that they will actually be able to put the nuclear capability on those ballistic missiles that they have already.\nINSKEEP: I just want to make sure that I understand what you're saying, though. You're saying they had this program for building a nuclear weapon. Was Iran actively assembling a nuclear weapon, according to your intelligence?\nDANON: Absolutely. They were moving forward. And I think what we realize that now, when they have enough uranium, they have the technology. And you know what? We believe them. They said very clearly, we will destroy the Jewish nation. They didn't hide it. So we decided not to take that chance. History have taught us that when you have a regime which threatens to annihilate the Jewish people, we better believe them. And that's why we took this preemptive attack to make sure that we will not be in a point that Iran will be able to implement those radical ideas.\nINSKEEP: Do you have any initial assessment as to whether you successfully damaged or destroyed the nuclear facilities, some of which would be well underground?\nDANON: Well, you know, it's too early to call it. You know, it's a long operation. It's going to be very intense in Israel in the next few days. We expect retaliation, and we will continue. You know, we have the ability to attack targets in Iran today. We will continue until we will be sure that Iran is not in a position of posing a threat to Israel and to the Western societies.\nINSKEEP: When you say you're going to continue, I want to understand what the rhythm is here. Are you suggesting that what Israel will do is assess the damage, decide if more strikes are needed, and then strike further as you judge? Is that what you see ahead?\nDANON: Well, I will not go into details, but, you know, once we decided to take those actions, we realized the consequences. But for the future generations, we took that decision in order to allow Israel to survive. And that's why we are determined to finish the job to make sure that Iran would not be a threat, not only to Israel. You know, they are threatening many allies of the U.S. in the region. I think now it's about time to create a new reality.\nINSKEEP: Ambassador, I want to keep you on the line for another couple of minutes to ask where the United States fits into this. We'll recall that President Trump had been trying for an agreement to limit or eliminate Iran's nuclear program. The strike comes just as the U.S. was preparing for another round of talks. What relationship is there, if any, in the timing? Did you consider the United States' position in deciding on the timing here?\nDANON: Well, we have a ongoing dialogue with our colleagues in D.C., but this decision was made in Jerusalem. It was an independent decision of Israel. We decided that we cannot wait anymore. It was an act of self-defense. And I want to remind you, Steve, you know, it happened in the past. In the '80s, Prime Minister Begin took a similar decision to attack the nuclear reactor in Iraq. We were isolated for a while. We were condemned by the U.N. and other international institutions. But when you look at it for today, you realize it was the right decision. Same with our attack against a nuclear reactor in Syria. So I think what we did there last night was a historic decision that will make the world a safer place for everybody.\nINSKEEP: President Trump, though, has urged Iran again this morning to take the opportunity to make a deal. He's effectively said this attack is a warning. You'd better act before you lose everything. Hurry up and make a deal. Does Israel want the United States to make an agreement over Iran's nuclear program with Iran?\nDANON: Well, we look at the end result. You know, we want to have a situation where we can live peacefully. You know, when you look at the map, you see the distance between Iran and Israel. We have no dispute with the Iranian people whatsoever - you know, no borders, no conflict. It's only the radical ideology that leads them to spend billions of dollars against Israel, providing it to the proxies and building the ballistic missiles. And if you will allow me, I will elaborate on that.\nIran wanted to reach a position that they will have the same amount of ballistic missiles like the United States in order to threaten Israel. So it was an imminent threat. That's why we took this action.\nINSKEEP: And just to be clear - we've got about 10 seconds - do you want the United States to make a nuclear agreement with Iran?\nDANON: So we want to get to a position that there is no threat against Israel. If you can achieve it diplomatically, we always prefer that. But we saw in the last few decades that the Iranians lied. They played the game, but at the same time, they continued to build their capabilities.\nINSKEEP: Danny Danon is Israel's ambassador to the United Nations. He's on the line this morning. Ambassador, thanks so much for your time - really appreciate it.\nDANON: Thank you very much, Steve.\nCopyright &copy; 2025 NPR. All rights reserved.

Because the targets have been so widespread by Israel, no area can be considered safe.\nIn Tehran, the government announced they were opening the metro stations 24 hours a day so people can take shelter.\nTehran has 10 million people, so you can imagine evacuating that number of people is not really possible.\n**- Nafiseh Kohnavard, Middle East correspondent**\n![]![Reuters A crowd of Iranians in Tehran] Reuters\nTen million people live in Tehran\n## If US enters the conflict, would Iran strike US targets?\nThere is certainly risk, and the consequences for the US are fairly significant.\nThere are about 40,000 to 50,000 US troops at around 19 locations across the Middle East. There are US personnel based in Cyprus, and a US naval facility in Bahrain.\nIt will all depend on how the US decides to get involved, and to what extent.\n**- Mikey Kay, Security Brief host**\n## Could Iran&#x27;s proxies support it in conflict with Israel?\nI don&#x27;t think so - not any longer.\nSince Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, 2023, Israel has systematically taken down a lot of the first line of defence that Iran had.\nThey have depleted Hamas in Gaza, they have largely depleted Hezbollah&#x27;s arsenal in Lebanon, and Syria is no longer an ally of Iran because Bashar al-Assad has been deposed, albeit not by Israel.\nThe Houthis meanwhile are relatively constrained in Yemen. So they are not very well coordinated.\n**- Frank Gardner, security correspondent**\n![]![EPA An Israeli strike on Hezbollah in Lebanon earlier this month] EPA\nAn Israeli strike on Hezbollah in Lebanon earlier this month\n## Who is Iran&#x27;s leader and how much support does he have?\nIran&#x27;s supreme leader is Ali Khamenei. He is a religious figure, but he has much more power than Iran&#x27;s president.\nHe is the commander-in-chief of the armed forces and is a decision-maker for the country, including negotiations with the US.\nBut he does not command the support of all of Iran - his people are divided, and that division is deepening.\nIran witnessed huge protests against the regime only two years ago. Women participated in those protests, demanding their rights and freedoms.\nBut we cannot ignore that this regime still has its supporters - including in the armed forces which are connected to the regime.\n**- Nafiseh Kohnavard, Middle East correspondent**\n![]![Reuters Ali Khamenei] Reuters\nAli Khamenei\n## What happens if the regime is overthrown in Iran?\nThere&#x27;s no clear answer.\nWe&#x27;ve seen over the last few years that there is no united opposition who could work together to replace the government.\nRight now there are different options, including Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the former Shah of Iran, who is now living abroad.\nHe has supporters inside and outside Iran, but how many we can&#x27;t really say.\nHe has opponents as well, including reformists inside. They may not want to go back to Iran&#x27;s monarchy that was overthrown nearly 40 years ago.\nSo it&#x27;s not clear if there is one replacement.\n**- Nafiseh Kohnavard, Middle East correspondent**\n## Where is Fordo and what is it?\nFordo is about 200km (124 miles) south of Tehran and is one of two critical enrichment facilities Iran has.\nIt has been built into a mountain for its protection. And it is basically one of the key enrichment facilities that Iran has been using to boost its enriched uranium stockpile.\nFordo has been struck by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) already. However, it is believed the attacks were going after Iran&#x27;s surface-to-air missiles and air defence capabilities around it, in order to make it more vulnerable.\n**- Mikey Kay, Security Brief host**\n![]![Maxar Satellite image of Fordo, buried deep beneath a mountain] Maxar\nFordo is buried deep beneath a mountain\n## How close is Iran to getting a nuclear bomb?\nThe only people who know for certain whether or not Iran was working towards building a nuclear bomb are Iran&#x27;s most trusted nuclear scientists, the inner core of security officials and the supreme leader himself. The rest is conjecture.\nBut the alarm was raised earlier this month when the UN&#x27;s nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, found Iran to be in breach of its non-proliferation obligations, for the first time in nearly 20 years. Iran has amassed around 400kg of uranium enriched to 60%, well beyond the level needed for civil nuclear purposes.\nThe UN agency said Iran had failed to cooperate fully and that it was unable to verify there had been no diversion of nuclear material to nuclear weapons. That is not the same though, as stating Iran was racing towards building a bomb.\nThe Israeli military said last week that &quot;over the past few months intelligence has shown that Iran is closer than ever to obtaining a nuclear weapon&quot;.\nBut whose intelligence? Not apparently, its closest ally&#x27;s. In March, the US director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, told Congress that &quot;while Iran had an unprecedented stockpile of weapons-grade uranium, it did not appear to be building a nuclear weapon&quot;.\nIran, meanwhile, has always maintained that its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful.\n**- Frank Gardner, security correspondent**\n## Does Israel have nuclear weapons?\nThere are estimates that it has about 90 nuclear warheads. But the real answer is we do not know.\nIt has neither confirmed nor denied a nuclear capability,\nIsrael is not part of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, which was a global agreement to prevent more nations acquiring the bomb.\nIt takes three components to have a nuclear weapon: first, uranium enriched to 90%, second, the ability to build a warhead, and third, a way to deliver that warhead to a target.\nAs it stands, there is no overt declaration by Israel on any of the above.\n**- Mikey Kay, Security Brief host**\n[Middle East] \n[Israel] \n[Iran] \nRelated\n[\n## Seven more countries agree to join Trump&#x27;s Board of Peace\n] \n[\n## New ceasefire in Syria after Kurdish-led forces pull out of camp for IS families\n] \n[\n## Putin invited to join US-led Gaza &#x27;Board of Peace&#x27;, Trump says\n] \nMore from the BBC\n[\n2 days ago\n![]![The Somaliland president, Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, wearing a black suit, white shirt and red tie with traditional hat is posing with Eric Trump.

Selected Iran-Backed Groups] \nSummary\nDynamics between the United States and the Islamic Republic of Iran have shifted in the past year: after Iran faced significant military and strategic setbacks in 2024, largely at the hands of Israel and the United States, U.S. and Iranian diplomats are now engaged in the first diplomatic talks in years over Iran's nuclear program. U.S. partners and adversaries are likely to consider the outcomes of that engagement in making future assumptions and policy decisions. Congress, which has overseen and shaped U.S. policy toward longtime adversary Iran, may use legislative policy tools to influence U.S.-Iran discussions and respond to their results.\nSuccessive U.S. Administrations have identified several Iranian policies as challenges to U.S. interests, including the Iranian government's support for terrorist groups and other partners across the Middle East region (sometimes referred to as the 'axis of resistance'); Iran's missile and nuclear programs; its human rights violations; and its deepening ties with Russia and the People's Republic of China. Congress has played a major role in shaping U.S. policy toward Iran, including by authorizing extensive U.S. sanctions, reviewing past diplomatic agreements with Iran, and funding support to U.S. partners facing Iranian threats. Iran and the United States do not have formal diplomatic relations and have largely acted antagonistically since the Iranian Revolution of 1979 but have periodically participated in bilateral or multilateral negotiations. Opposition to the United States and its regional influence has been a defining feature of the Islamic Republic's identity and ideology since its establishment.\nIran-backed groups began a parallel campaign of attacks on Israeli, U.S., and other targets across the Middle East in the aftermath of the October 2023 attack on Israel led by Hamas (a longtime recipient of Iranian support) and the onset of the Israel-Hamas war. The United States and various U.S. partners sought to deter and respond to these attacks, including via military action. Iran directly attacked Israel on two occasions, and the United States and other U.S. partners contributed to Israel's defense. In 2024, Iran's regional position weakened significantly, raising questions about the future viability of the \"axis of resistance\": Israel severely degraded Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza, and regime change in Syria removed a longtime Iranian ally. These setbacks, as well as the reportedly underwhelming performance and uncertain future of Iran's once-vaunted ballistic missile program, suggest that Iran's leaders may no longer be able to rely as much on these traditional asymmetric methods of Iranian power projection. The apparent degradation of some of Iran's regional allies, and the failure of these groups and Iran's own capabilities to deter direct Israeli military action against Iran and its allies, have sparked debate among Iranian policymakers about the future of Iran's strategic calculus, including its nuclear program.\nWeeks after retaking office, President Donald Trump directed the imposition of 'maximum pressure' on the Iranian regime via sanctions, legal action, and other means to \"end its nuclear threat\" and abandon its support for terrorist groups. President Trump has threatened U.S. military action against Iran (and has increased the U.S. force posture in the region) while expressing his preference for a deal that ensures Iran cannot obtain a nuclear weapon. In April 2025, U.S. and Iranian officials began diplomatic talks around such a deal. President Trump in 2018 ceased U.S. participation in a prior multilateral accord, the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which imposed restraints on Iran's nuclear activities in exchange for relief from most U.S. and international sanctions. The U.S. intelligence community continues to assess that Iran is not currently undertaking nuclear weapons-related activities, but that Iran could enrich enough uranium for more than a dozen nuclear weapons within weeks if it chose to do so. Iran's enrichment capabilities appear central to ongoing talks.\nAs of May 2025, President Trump has said the two sides are \"close\" to a deal. Depending on whether or not an accord emerges and its possible contours, U.S. and Israeli interests could align or diverge, particularly if Israeli officials (some of whom have reportedly favored military action against Iran) assess that the components of a U.S.-Iran agreement do not meet Israel's national security needs. In early 2025, President Trump reportedly discouraged an Israeli plan to strike Iran's nuclear facilities that may have anticipated U.S. support. Saudi Arabia and some other regional allies have expressed support for U.S.-Iran talks, perhaps a result of their own rapprochement with Iran in recent years.\nU.S.-Iran diplomacy and the responses of regional and global actors to U.S. policy may prompt new issues, decisions, and debates for Congress. If talks lead to a formal agreement on Iran's nuclear program, current law requires the Administration to submit the accord for congressional review. Congress could assess a nuclear agreement on its merits and weigh whether or how to engage on other issues of congressional concern such as regional security and human rights. Congress could exercise oversight of executive branch actions (including the content and conduct of negotiations) and could consider measures supporting, opposing, or placing conditions on the relaxation or removal of U.S. sanctions on Iran. Were talks not to result in an agreement or to end acrimoniously, Congress could take action with respect to the authorization, costs, and possible outcomes of U.S. military action against Iran and questions related to U.S. support to Israel or other U.S. partners potentially threatened by Iran.\nOverview and Issues for Congress\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran, the second-largest country in the Middle East by size (after Saudi Arabia) and population (after Egypt), has for decades played an assertive, and by many accounts destabilizing, role in the region and beyond. Iran also derives influence from its oil reserves (the world's fourth largest) and its status as the world's most populous Shia Muslim country.\n|\n|\nFigure 1.

Fact information (2024 estimates unless otherwise specified) from Economist Intelligence Unit, International Monetary Fund, and Central Intelligence Agency, The World Factbook.\nSince the 1979 Iranian Revolution that overthrew the U.S.-backed Shah and ushered in the Islamic Republic, Iran has presented a major foreign policy challenge for the United States, with successive U.S. Administrations identifying Iran and its activities as a threat to the United States and its interests. Of particular concern are the Iranian government's nuclear program, its military capabilities, its support for terrorist groups, and its partnerships with Russia and the People's Republic of China (PRC). The U.S. government has condemned the Iranian government's human rights violations and detention of U.S. citizens and others, and has wrestled with how to support protest movements in Iran. The United States has used a range of policy tools intended to reduce the threat posed by Iran, including sanctions, limited military action, and diplomatic engagement.\nCongress has played a key role in shaping U.S. policy toward Iran, authorizing extensive U.S. sanctions, providing aid and authorizing arms sales for partners threatened by Iran, seeking to influence negotiations over Iran's nuclear program, and enacting legislation that requires congressional review of related agreements (the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015, or INARA, [P.L. 114-17]). Much of that legislative activity was related to the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which restricted Iran's nuclear program in return for relief from most U.S. and international sanctions; the Trump Administration ceased U.S. participation in the agreement in 2018 as part of its strategy to deploy \"maximum pressure\" against Iran. Biden Administration attempts to reestablish mutual compliance with the JCPOA foundered amid other developments, such as nationwide unrest in Iran and Iran's provision of weapons to Russia for use in Ukraine.\nThe October 2023 attack on Israel led by Hamas, an Iran-backed Palestinian Sunni Islamist group (and U.S. designated Foreign Terrorist Organization, or FTO), and subsequent attacks on U.S. forces and other targets by Iran-supported groups in Lebanon, Iraq, and Yemen, have sharpened congressional attention on Iran's regional activities. Since summer 2024, Iran and the groups it supports have experienced key setbacks, including the killing of multiple Hamas leaders, major losses for Lebanese Hezbollah, the fall of the Asad regime in Syria, U.S. and Israeli strikes against the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen, and direct military exchanges between Israel and Iran in which Iran appears to have suffered greater harm than it was able to inflict on Israel.\nIn February 2025, President Donald Trump announced the imposition of \"maximum pressure on the Iranian regime to end its nuclear threat, curtail its ballistic missile program, and stop its support for terrorist groups.\" The next month, he sent a letter to Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei encouraging negotiations on Iran's nuclear program, reportedly setting a two-month deadline to reach a deal; talks involving U.S. and Iranian diplomats began in April 2025 and continued in May. During his May 2025 visit to the Middle East, President Trump said, \"I think we're getting close to maybe doing a deal\" but also said \"we don't have a lot of time to wait.\" Changes in the pace and progress of talks could change President Trump's calculations regarding diplomacy and possible military action. Congress has not explicitly authorized the use of military force against Iran. The President has consistently expressed that he prefers diplomacy but is prepared to use force. The United States moved additional military assets into the Middle East region in early 2025.\nU.S.-Iran diplomacy and the responses of regional and global actors to U.S. policy may prompt new issues, decisions, and debates for Congress. If talks lead to a formal agreement on Iran's nuclear program, the Administration would be required to submit the accord for congressional review under INARA. Congress could assess a nuclear agreement on its merits and weigh whether or how to engage on other issues of congressional concern such as regional security and human rights. Congress could exercise oversight of executive branch actions (including the content and conduct of negotiations) and could consider measures supporting, opposing, or placing conditions on the relaxation or removal of U.S. sanctions on Iran. Were talks not to result in an agreement or to end acrimoniously, Congress could face decisions about the authorization, costs, and likely outcomes of U.S. military action against Iran and questions related to U.S. support to Israel or other U.S. partners potentially threatened by Iran.\nDepending on the contours of any agreement that might materialize, U.S. and Israeli interests could align or diverge, particularly if Israeli officials assess that Iran could reverse some of the setbacks it suffered in military exchanges with Israel last year, or that the components of a U.S.-Iran agreement do not meet Israel's national security needs. In early 2025, President Trump reportedly discouraged an Israeli plan to strike Iran's nuclear facilities that may have anticipated U.S. support, though U.S.-Israel consultations on a possible strike may intensify given some reports about ongoing Israeli military preparations in anticipation that U.S.-Iran talks might stall.\nIran's \"Axis of Resistance\" and Regional Conflict\nIran-backed groups such as Lebanon's Hezbollah, Iraq's armed Shia militias, and Yemen's Ansarallah/Houthis, are distinct in their motives and capabilities, but collaborate and sometimes refer to themselves as the \"axis of resistance.\" At different times and in different contexts over a period of decades, these groups have threatened various U.S. interests. Since 2023, they have engaged militarily against U.S. forces and partners across multiple fronts to a degree not previously seen. Setbacks to Iran and the groups it supports, including military operations in 2024 and 2025 by Israeli and U.S. forces, appear to have altered the balance of power in the Middle East, though Iran-backed groups retain some capabilities and have demonstrated resilience in the past.\nBackground\nTo advance its priorities, such as reducing U.S. regional influence, defending Shia communities in other countries, and projecting power, Iran has pursued a strategy of backing political and armed groups in the Middle East (see **Figure ****2****).** Support for foreign partners, a pillar of the Iranian government's foreign policy since the 1979 founding of the Islamic Republic, has carried strategic benefits and risks for Iran. Iranian leaders might have seen supporting armed groups as a cost-effective way to project power, given that Iran lacks some key conventional military capabilities (such as modern fighter jets). Iran-backed groups often have been both relatively decentralized and \"deeply embedded in the socio-political fabric\" of the countries in which they have operated.[1] \n|\nFigure 2. Selected Iran-Backed Groups\n|\n|![media/image5.png] |\n|\n**Source: **Created by CRS, based on U.S. Department of State, *Country Reports on Terrorism* and other open sources.\n|\nThe sometimes-opaque nature of Iranian support for these groups may also allow Iran to attempt to deny responsibility for its beneficiaries' actions.[2] Nonetheless, the United States and others may still seek to hold Iran accountable, including for actions that Iran may not have specifically directed or approved in advance. For example, in March 2025, President Trump stated that attacks from the Houthis would be regarded as attacks from Iran and that Iran \"will be held responsible, and suffer the consequences\" of Houthi attacks.[3] \nU.S. government statements have catalogued Iranian support to various armed groups, including the \"funding, training, weapons, and equipment\" that Iran has provided to them.[4] Experts debate the nature of Iranian influence over these groups and their activities. Some contend that the groups are \"mere appendages\" of Iran that directly follow Tehran's orders.[5] Others assert that these groups have their own origins and grievances, \"varying degrees of autonomy,\" and \"symbiotic\" relationships with Tehran, and sometimes take actions independent of those of the Iranian government.[6] The Intelligence Community's 2025 *Annual* *Threat Assessment* describes the axis of resistance as \"a loose consortium of like-minded terrorist and militant actors.\"[7] \nThe Iranian government's support for regional groups is coordinated by Iran's **Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC)**. The IRGC is a parallel military institution to Iran's regular armed forces, plays a major unofficial role in Iran's economy, and is responsible for regime security.[8] The **IRGC-Qods Force (IRGC-QF) **is the** **IRGC component \"responsible for conducting covert lethal activities outside of Iran, including asymmetric and terrorist operations.\"[9] Both the IRGC and the IRGC-QF are designated for U.S. sanctions under terrorism-related authorities, as are many of the Iran-supported regional armed groups below.\nAttacks and Setbacks Since October 2023\nIn the aftermath of the October 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel, a number of Iran-backed groups began attacking Israeli, U.S., and other targets in unprecedented coordination.[10] The United States, Israel, and various other U.S. partners have sought to deter and respond to these attacks, including via military action. Since summer 2024, this Iranian strategy has faced multiple setbacks, raising questions about the future viability of the \"axis of resistance\" and Iran's support for and relations with each group comprising it.\n* In the **Gaza Strip and West Bank**,[11] the Iranian government has supported Hamas for decades, going back nearly to the group's inception in the late 1980s.[12] Iranian officials expressed enthusiastic support for the October 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel, but \"did not orchestrate nor had foreknowledge of\" the attack, per the Intelligence Community's 2024 *Annual* *Threat Assessment*.[13] In July 2024, Israel killed **Hamas** political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, when he visited to attend the inauguration of Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian. While Israeli officials and outside observers continue to debate the achievability of Israel's stated war aim of destroying Hamas's military and political capacities in Gaza, then-Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said in October 2024 that Iran could no longer effectively use Hamas in Gaza against Israel.[14] In light of Hamas setbacks in Gaza, Iran has reportedly shifted some of its focus to supporting Palestinian militants in the West Bank.[15] \n* In **Lebanon**, Hezbollah, backed by Iran since the group's founding in the 1980s and once seen as the \"crown jewel\" of Iranian foreign policy, began firing into Israel in support of Hamas on October 8, 2023.[16] In September 2024 Israel killed longtime Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in an airstrike in Beirut, an attack that also killed an Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) general. Israel also launched ground operations against the group in southern Lebanon. After two months of fighting and the loss of significant manpower and parts of its arsenal, Hezbollah acceded to a U.S.- and French-brokered November 2024 cease-fire with Israel.[17] Even as some Iranian officials hailed the agreement as a Hezbollah victory, Tehran reportedly pushed for the cease-fire to prevent the group's further weakening. Per some media sources, some in Hezbollah criticized Iran and other Iran-backed groups for not having done more to support it.[18] \n* In **Iraq ****and Syria**, Iran-backed groups increased their attacks against U.S. forces after October 2023.[19] Those attacks left dozens of U.S. troops injured and three dead (in Jordan).[20] In response, the U.S. military conducted occasional airstrikes on Iran-linked targets in both Syria and Iraq, including some facilities used by IRGC personnel. Groups in Iraq also targeted Israel.\n* In **Yemen**, the Iran-backed Houthi movement has claimed several drone and missile attacks against Israel, asserting solidarity with Hamas and Palestinians in Gaza. While many have been intercepted by Israeli or U.S. forces, some have struck Israel, leading to retaliatory Israeli airstrikes in Yemen.[21] The Houthis also began attacking vessels in the Red Sea in November 2023, prompting U.S. and allied airstrikes against Houthi positions starting in January 2024.[22] After an expanded campaign of U.S. strikes in Yemen began in March 2025, President Trump posted on social media that \"while Iran has lessened its intensity on Military Equipment and General Support to the Houthis, they are still sending large levels of Supplies.\"[23] In May 2025, the Houthis reportedly agreed to stop targeting U.S. warships (though a Houthi spokesperson said they will continue to target Israel) in return for a halt to U.S. airstrikes, an arrangement possibly encouraged by Iran.[24] \n* In December 2024, **then****-****Syrian President Bashar al Asad **fled the country as his forces collapsed in the face of an offensive by armed opposition groups. Biden Administration officials and many outside observers attributed Asad's downfall at least in part to what they said was the weakening of his main supporters Iran, Hezbollah, and Russia.[25] Iranian officials have said that after Asad's ouster, which Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei blamed on an \"American-Zionist plot,\" no Iranian forces remain in Syria.[26] In January 2025, Syrian authorities reportedly banned Iranians from entering the country.\nIran also engaged in two direct military exchanges with Israel, in April and October 2024. In both cases, the United States and other partners helped counter Iranian missile and drone attacks on Israel. According to various sources, Israel's October strikes substantially degraded Iran's ballistic missile production capabilities and air defenses.[27] \nAssessing Impact\nTogether, these setbacks cast doubt on the viability of Iran's strategy of putting pressure on, and deterring direct attacks from, Israel and the United States by supporting regional armed groups. Even before the December 2024 fall of the Asad regime, the apparent attenuation of Hamas and Hezbollah led some to argue that Iran's regional strategy had failed and that the axis \"was more or less a propaganda fiction to enhance the prestige of the Islamic Republic.\"[28] For Iran, Hezbollah's weakening is damaging not just because Iran's most valued and supposedly powerful ally has lost most of its senior leaders, thousands of fighters, and as much as 80% of its once-vaunted drone and missile arsenal to Israeli operations, but also because that ally has failed to prevent or deter direct Israeli attacks, including on Iran itself. As one analyst assessed, events in 2024 showed that \"[w]hile Iran will use its partners in defense of itself, the reverse is not true, and it is unlikely to go to war with Israel to save one of those partners.\"[29] \nThe fall of the Asad regime in Syria arguably represents an even more critical blow to Iran's regional outlook; one Iranian observer described Syria as \"the backbone of our regional presence.\"[30] In the aftermath of regime change in Syria, some in Iran, including former government officials, have publicly questioned the wisdom of Iran's past support for Asad and called for a new, less confrontational approach to the region.[31] Iran's ability to rebuild Hezbollah is likely to be constrained in the aftermath of Asad's downfall, though much depends on the evolution of governing arrangements in Syria. One observer cautions that \"Iranian arms smuggling has historically thrived in collapsed or weak state environments.\"[32] During Asad's rule, Iran and groups it supports were able to threaten neighboring Israel directly from Syria, where they were often the target of Israeli airstrikes. Syria was also a key territorial link in Iran's provision of weaponry to militants in the West Bank.[33] \nIran's Options\nTactically, Iran's regional activities going forward could focus more on partners in Iraq (where after discussions with the Iraqi government, the U.S. government announced in September 2024 that the U.S.-led coalition's military mission would end within a year) and Yemen. However, various factors could limit the effectiveness of these groups as alternatives to Hezbollah for Iran, including the resistance of some Iraqis to greater Iranian influence wielded via Iran-backed Iraqi militias; doctrinal and ideological differences between the Iranian government and the Houthis; and Iraqi and Yemeni groups' evidently smaller arsenals, local political and security constraints, and greater geographic distance from Israel.[34] The Houthis acceded to a May 2025 ceasefire with the United States but a spokesperson said they intend to continue attacks on Israel, while Iran-backed Iraqi groups reportedly debate how to calibrate their activities amid threatened Israeli strikes in Iraq, U.S.-Iran talks, and Iraq's November 2025 national election. Iran could also increase its efforts to foment instability in the West Bank by supporting militants there.\nMore fundamentally, the Iranian government continues to face a strategic conundrum: the regime has reportedly assessed that it could lose domestic and international legitimacy by not responding to Israeli attacks, but would be unlikely to prevail in the all-out war with the United States and/or Israel that forceful reprisals could provoke.[35] While Iran and the groups it supports retain some capability to counter or threaten regional rivals, their underwhelming military performance in 2024 has led some observers to predict that Iranian leaders may seek to advance the country's nuclear program as a more effective and reliable means of deterrence (see \"[Iran's Nuclear Program] \" below), particularly if U.S. and/or Israeli leaders attempt to press what they see as an advantage over a weakened Iranian regime.[36] \nU.S.-Iran Relations: Background and 2025 Nuclear Talks\nU.S.-Iran relations have been mostly adversarial since the 1979 Iranian Revolution, which deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, an authoritarian monarch who was a close U.S. ally, and led to the establishment of the Islamic Republic. The United States and Iran have not had diplomatic relations since 1980, following the U.S. Embassy hostage crisis.[37] \nU.S.-Iran tensions continued in the following decade, punctuated by armed confrontations in the Gulf and Iran-backed terrorist attacks (including the 1983 bombings of the U.S. Embassy and Marine barracks in Beirut). U.S. sanctions, first imposed in 1979, continued apace with the U.S. government designating Iran as a state sponsor of acts of international terrorism in 1984, an embargo on U.S. trade with and investment in Iran in 1995, and the first imposition of secondary sanctions (U.S. penalties against foreign firms that invest in Iran's energy sector) in 1996.\nBilateral relations briefly improved during the late 1990s, but tensions rose again in the early 2000s amid reports of heightened Iranian armed support for Palestinian groups and the revelation of previously undisclosed nuclear facilities in Iran.[38] The United Nations Security Council imposed sanctions on Iran's nuclear program in response to concerns that the program could enable Iranian nuclear weapons development. Also during this time frame, Congress enacted major legislation significantly increasing sanctions on Iran, particularly on its oil exports. U.S. officials credited sanctions with bringing Iran to the negotiating table; multilateral talks around Iran's nuclear program culminated in the 2015 nuclear agreement (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, JCPOA) that placed limits on Iran's nuclear activities in exchange for relief from most economic sanctions.[39] \nPresident Donald Trump announced on May 8, 2018, that the United States would cease participating in the JCPOA, reinstating all sanctions that the United States had waived or terminated in meeting its JCPOA obligations. In articulating a new Iran strategy in May 2018, then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that due to \"unprecedented financial pressure\" through reimposed U.S. sanctions, U.S. military deterrence, and U.S. advocacy, \"we hope, and indeed we expect, that the Iranian regime will come to its senses.\"[40] He also laid out 12 demands for any future agreement with Iran, including the withdrawal of Iranian support for armed groups throughout the region. Iran's leaders rejected U.S. demands and insisted the United States return to compliance with the JCPOA before engaging on a new or revised accord.\nFrom mid-2019 on, Iran escalated its regional military activities, at times coming into direct military conflict with the United States. Several Iranian attacks against oil tankers in the Persian Gulf and a September 2019 drone attack against Saudi Arabian oil production facilities further increased tensions. Those tensions spiked with the Trump Administration's January 3, 2020, killing of IRGC-Qods Force commander Qasem Soleimani in Baghdad, and Iran's retaliatory ballistic missile strikes against U.S. forces in Iraq and subsequent attacks by Iran-backed forces in Iraq against U.S. targets.[41] Iran also began exceeding JCPOA-mandated limits on its nuclear activities in 2019, per the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).[42] \nThe Biden Administration initiated indirect talks with Iran over its nuclear program but discussions petered out amid other developments, such as nationwide unrest in Iran (see **text box, **\"2022-2023 Protests\" below) and Iran's provision of weapons to Russia for use in Ukraine.[43] In September 2023, Iran and the United States concluded a prisoner exchange, in connection with which the United States facilitated the transfer of $6 billion of Iranian funds from South Korea (where they had been held as payment for pre-2019 exports of Iranian oil to South Korea) to Qatar.[44] In the wake of the October 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel, the House passed legislation ([H.R. 5961]) that would have, among other provisions, directed the President to impose sanctions on any foreign financial institution that engages in transactions with the $6 billion in Iranian funds. In testimony the following month, a State Department official said of the funds, \"Not a penny of this money has been spent and these funds will not go anywhere anytime soon.\"[45] Iranian officials continue to press Qatar to release the funds.[46] \nDevelopments under the Second Trump Administration: 'Maximum Pressure' and Negotiations\nIn February 2025, President Trump signed National Security Presidential Memorandum 2 (NSPM-2), which directs U.S. officials to impose \"maximum pressure\" on Iran to compel it to abandon its nuclear program and support for terrorist groups.[47] NSPM-2 directs the imposition and enforcement of sanctions, issuance of guidance to industry, pursuit of Iran's diplomatic isolation, and legal steps against Iranian activities inside the United States. In signing NSPM-2 in February, President Trump said that he was \"torn about\" it, adding \"hopefully, we're not going to have to use it very much\" and reiterating his preference for a \"deal.\"[48] President Trump also indicated that month that he would \"much prefer a Verified Nuclear Peace Agreement\" with Iran over military action, and that \"We should start working on it immediately.\"[49] \nAt the same time, Trump Administration officials have consistently stated, as did their counterparts in previous Administrations, that \"all options are on the table,\" potentially including direct U.S. military action. In March 2025, President Trump threatened Iran with \"bombing the likes of which they have never seen before\" if \"they don't make a deal.\"[50] Throughout spring 2025, the United States reportedly dispatched a \"record-breaking\" amount of U.S. military assets and materiel to bases across the region, including B-2 stealth bombers.[51] \nIn March 2025, President Trump said that he had sent a letter to Supreme Leader Khamenei saying \"I hope you're going to negotiate, because if we have to go in militarily, it's going to be a terrible thing for\" Iran.[52] According to one media report, the letter included a two-month deadline for Iran to reach a new nuclear agreement.[53] Iranian officials sent mixed public signals regarding negotiations: some expressed openness to talks under certain conditions, while others cast doubt on the viability of negotiating with the United States.[54] In an April 8, 2025, opinion editorial in the *Washington Post*, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi pointed to Iran's affirmation in the JCPOA that \"under no circumstances will Iran ever seek, develop or acquire any nuclear weapons,\" and argued that \"the scope for trade and investment in Iran is unparalleled.\"[55] \nOn April 12, 2025, U.S. and Iranian diplomats met for the first such reported engagement in nearly three years. The talks were mostly indirect, with the host government of Oman as an intermediary. The meeting also included a reported face-to-face interaction between U.S. Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff and Foreign Minister Araghchi—the first such direct meeting between U.S. and Iranian diplomats since 2017.[56] The two sides met again in Rome (with Omani mediation) on April 19 and in Oman on April 26 and May 11.\nWhile both sides criticize, and deny analyses that compare current engagements to, the JCPOA (see **text**** ****box** below), talks appear to center on the same issues: Iran agreeing to potential restrictions on its nuclear program in exchange for the United States agreeing to reduce sanctions pressure on Iran.[57] Iran's enrichment capability appears to be a crucial point: Special Envoy Witkoff said in May that \"we have one very, very clear red line, and that is enrichment. We cannot allow even 1 percent of an enrichment capability.\"[58] President Trump in a May 2025 interview said his goal was \"total dismantlement\" of Iran's nuclear program but that he'd be \"open\" to Iran having a \"civilian\" nuclear program.[59] Members have expressed a range of views, with some expressing support for the elimination of Iran's enrichment capability.[60] In May 14, 2025, letters to President Trump, 52 Senators and 177 Representatives argued against \"any deal that allows Iran to retain any enrichment capability.\"[61] For his part, the Iranian foreign minister has said \"the issue of enrichment is non-negotiable,\" while a close advisor to Supreme Leader Khamenei said (in comments highlighted on social media by President Trump) Iran could agree to restrictions on its stockpiles of highly enriched uranium and on its enrichment levels as part of an agreement.[62] \nAs of May 2025, the two sides have reportedly exchanged written proposals, and President Trump said in his visit to the Middle East that month that \"I think we're getting close to maybe doing a deal\" but also said \"we don't have a lot of time to wait.\"[63] The pace and progress of negotiations could shape the Trump Administration's calculus regarding diplomacy and military action; the President has consistently expressed that he prefers the former but is prepared to carry out the latter. Congress has not explicitly authorized the use of military force against Iran. Negotiations, and the contours of whatever agreement emerges from them (if any), could also have implications for U.S.-Israeli relations, given some Israeli officials' reported preference for a military strike (see \"[Outlook] \" below). In May 2025 testimony, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, referencing INARA, said \"Congress has a right to weigh in on any deal and could actually reverse any deal.\"[64] \n|\nThe 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (2015)\nMany observers assess that U.S. and multilateral sanctions contributed to Iran's 2013 decision to enter into negotiations that concluded in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) between China, the European Union, France, Germany, Iran, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States.[65] The JCPOA imposed restraints on Iran's nuclear program in exchange for relief from most U.S. and UN Security Council economic sanctions. The agreement restricted Iran's enrichment and heavy water reactor programs and provided for enhanced IAEA monitoring to detect Iranian efforts to produce nuclear weapons using either declared or covert facilities. The nuclear-related provisions of the agreement, according to U.S. officials in 2015, extended the nuclear breakout time—the amount of time that Iran would need to produce enough weapons-grade HEU for one nuclear weapon—to a minimum of one year, for a duration of at least 10 years.[66] In addition to the restrictions on activities related to fissile material production, the JCPOA indefinitely prohibited Iranian \"activities which could contribute to the design and development of a nuclear explosive device,\" including research activities. President Trump announced in 2018 that the United States would \"withdraw\" from the JCPOA and begin reimposing formerly-lifted U.S. sanctions.[67] The IAEA reports that Iran began to diminish implementation of its JCPOA commitments in May 2019 until Tehran \"stopped implementing them altogether\" in February 2021.[68] \n|\nIran's Foreign Policy\nIran's foreign policy appears to reflect overlapping and at times contradictory motivations, including countering perceived threats from the United States and U.S. partners like Israel, with which Iran has seen \"itself as locked in an existential struggle\";[69] positioning Iran as the defender of Shia Muslim communities and other groups that the Iranian government characterizes as oppressed, such as the Palestinians; advancing the revolutionary ideology of the Islamic Republic; and pursuing Iran's geopolitical interests.[70] \nRelations with Middle Eastern States\nIran's relations with many of its Middle Eastern neighbors have often been tense. The Islamic Republic's leaders have perceived these countries' close ties with the United States as threatening; Iran's neighbors have viewed Iran's revolutionary regime warily and at times with hostility, and underlying religious differences have strained ties. Much of this tension has focused on Saudi Arabia, which has long accused Iran of interference in its Shia minority community. In 2016, tensions boiled over, with the Saudi execution of a Shia cleric being followed by an attack on Saudi diplomatic facilities in Iran. The two countries severed relations and backed opposing sides in several civil wars or domestic power struggles, including in Yemen, Syria, and Lebanon.\nIran has since 2021 sought rapprochement with several regional powers, particularly Saudi Arabia. The two countries held talks throughout 2022 that culminated in a 2023 trilateral announcement, with China, that Iran and Saudi Arabia would reestablish ties.[71] The two countries have reopened their respective embassies and have exchanged official visits, including an April 2025 visit to Tehran by Saudi Arabia's defense minister. Saudi Arabia also welcomed the start of U.S.-Iran negotiations that month. Some analysts have attributed a perceived shift in Saudi official thinking since 2016, when the kingdom was reportedly skeptical of and opposed to the JCPOA, to Saudi reconciliation with Iran and concern that conflict involving Iran could disrupt the Saudi government's domestic development initiatives.[72] \nMeanwhile, Iran has sought rapprochement with other Saudi-aligned Arab states from which Iran has been estranged in recent years, such as Egypt and Bahrain.[73] Iran has normal political and economic relations with other U.S. regional partners, including Qatar, Iraq, Kuwait, and Oman.\nRelations with Russia and China\nIran has acted to maintain and expand economic and military ties with Moscow and Beijing, reflecting what analysts describe as a \"look East\" strategy favored by Supreme Leader Khamenei.[74] In 2024, Iran formally joined the BRICS group of emerging economies (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa).[75] The economic impacts of Iran's BRICS membership are likely to be minimal, at least in the short term, but Iranian leaders have characterized joining the group as a \"strategic victory\" that will buttress the Iranian government's efforts to resist U.S.-led attempts to isolate and pressure it (including sanctions).[76] \nIran and **Russia **maintain a multifaceted relationship, bolstered by a shared rejection of what they consider a U.S., or Western, led international order.[77] In the words of one analyst, \"as long as the West builds on its pressure campaign against Russia and Iran, Moscow and Tehran are likely to pursue further integration as a collective response.\"[78] Relations between Iran and Russia have grown significantly in the wake of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Iran's drone program is at the heart of its growing military partnership with Russia: according to news accounts, Iran has transferred \"at least 1,000 attack drones\" and \"dozens of multipurpose\" drones to Russia, and the two countries have engaged in a \"joint venture\" at a factory in southeastern Russia that is producing hundreds of Iranian-designed drones.[79] In return, Iran has sought advanced fighter jets and air defense systems from Russia. Iran-Russia military cooperation has not been accompanied by a commensurate expansion of economic activity, though Russia and Iran have reportedly sought to cooperate on evading U.S. sanctions.[80] \nFor the past several decades, the **People's Republic of China** (PRC or China) has taken steps to deepen its financial presence in numerous sectors of the Iranian economy, as well as to expand military cooperation. China is Iran's largest trade partner and the largest importer of Iran's crude oil and condensates, despite U.S. sanctions; Chinese imports of Iranian oil reportedly reached new heights in 2024 (see CRS In Focus IF12952, [*Iran's Petroleum Exports to China and U.S. Sanctions*] ). In March 2021, Iran and the PRC signed a 25-year China-Iran Comprehensive Cooperation Plan \"to tap the potential for cooperation in areas such as economy and culture and map out prospects for cooperation in the long run.\"[81] The United States has imposed sanctions on a number of PRC-based entities for supplying Iran's missile, nuclear, and conventional weapons programs.\nIran's Political System\nIran's Islamic Republic was established in 1979, ending the autocratic monarchy of the Shah, and is a hybrid political system that defies simple characterization. Iran has a parliament, regular elections, and some other features of representative democracy. In practice, though, the government is authoritarian, ranking 154th out of 167 countries in the Economist Intelligence Unit's 2024 Democracy Index.[82] Shia Islam is the state religion and the basis for all legislation and jurisprudence, and political contestation is tightly controlled, with ultimate decisionmaking power in the hands of the Supreme Leader. That office has been held by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei since 1989, when he succeeded the Islamic Republic's founding leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Prospects for leadership succession to Khamenei (born 1939) are unclear. Iran's top directly elected position is the presidency, which, like the directly elected unicameral parliament (the Islamic Consultative Assembly, also known as the *Majles*) and every other organ of Iran's government, is subordinate to the Supreme Leader.\nIn May 2024, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi was killed in a helicopter accident, jolting Iran's political scene.[83] Raisi, a hardliner who was closely aligned with (and a potential successor to) Khamenei, had succeeded reformist president Hassan Rouhani by winning the June 2021 presidential election. Turnout in that election, in which several moderate candidates were barred from running, was the lowest in the Islamic Republic's history up to that point; slightly less than half (49%) of eligible Iranians voted. Turnout declined further to 41% in March 2024 parliamentary elections.[84] Raisi's presidency was characterized by a popular protest movement and violent crackdown at home (see **text**** ****box**), and regional turmoil and escalating tensions with the United States abroad.\n|\n2022-2023 Protests\nIran has intermittently experienced popular unrest, focused most frequently on economic conditions but also reflecting other grievances with Iran's leadership. The government has often used violence to disperse protests, in which hundreds have been killed by security forces.\nThe September 2022 death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who was arrested by Iran's Morality Police for allegedly violating Iran's mandatory hijab (head covering) law and died after reportedly having been beaten in custody, sparked another bout of nationwide unrest. In protests throughout the country, demonstrators voiced a broad range of grievances, with some calling for an end to the Islamic Republic and chanting \"death to the dictator.\" In response, the Iranian government deployed security forces who reportedly killed hundreds of protesters and arrested thousands, and shut down internet access. In March 2024, the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on the Islamic Republic of Iran issued its first report to the United Nations Human Rights Council, assessing that the Iranian government's \"violent repression of peaceful protests…led to serious human rights violations,\" including extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, rape, and gender persecution.[85] The protest movement receded over the course of 2023 but the fundamental grievances that motivated the outbreak of unrest in September 2022 (and in previous years) remain unresolved, so further rounds of popular protests are possible. The protest movement apparently lacked an organized structure, a visible leader, and a shared alternative vision for Iran's future, arguably limiting its capacity to pose an existential risk to the Islamic Republic.\nIn response to the protests, the Biden Administration announced sanctions designations targeting Iran's Morality Police and dozens of other government entities and officials for their role in the crackdown; issued a general license to counter what officials described as Tehran's move to \"cut off access to the Internet for most of its 80 million citizens to prevent the world from watching its violent crackdown on peaceful protestors\"; and led a successful effort to remove Iran from the UN Commission on the Status of Women in December 2022.\n|\nRaisi's unexpected death triggered a snap election in which several candidates were permitted to run; they included a number of prominent hardline figures as well as Masoud Pezeshkian, who was a relatively unknown member of parliament. Many analysts saw those hardliners as closer to Khamenei's own views, but also speculated that Pezeshkian's lack of a \"popular base\" or \"following within the regime structure\" might make him an acceptable option for Khamenei.[86] Pezeshkian ran on a platform that included reengaging with the United States to secure the lifting of U.S. sanctions on Iran.[87] He is thus generally regarded as a moderate, though some argue against describing Pezeshkian, or any participant in the tightly-controlled official politics of the Islamic Republic, as such.[88] Despite his low profile, Pezeshkian was able to consolidate reformist votes and apparently boost voter turnout, advancing to the run-off election and then winning that race, defeating a hardliner 55% to 45%.\nPezeshkian's presidency has been dominated by regional conflict, including the killing of Hamas leader Haniyeh in Tehran just hours after Pezeshkian's inauguration. Moreover, his ability to decisively change the course of U.S.-Iran relations appears limited, given his lack of a political base and the ultimate decisionmaking power of the Supreme Leader.[89] \nThough the regime appears to maintain some popular support and has considerable repressive capabilities that it uses often, it has also lost legitimacy in the eyes of many Iranians.[90] Authoritarian regimes can be vulnerable when under stress, and assessing their stability or fragility can be difficult.[91] The question of Supreme Leader succession could be a consequential and perhaps destabilizing moment for the Islamic Republic.\nIran's Military: Structure and Capabilities\nGiven the adversarial nature of U.S.-Iran relations and the centrality of various military-related entities in Iranian domestic and foreign policy, Iran's military has been a subject of sustained engagement by Congress and other U.S. policymakers.\nIran's traditional military force, the *Artesh*, is a legacy of Iran's Shah-era military force. The *Artesh* exists alongside the IRGC, which Khomeini established in 1979 as a force loyal to the new regime. Rivalries between the two parallel forces (each have their own land, air, and naval force components) stem from their \"uneven access to resources, varying levels of influence with the regime, and inherent overlap in missions and responsibilities.\"[92] While both serve to defend Iran against external threats, the government deploys the *Artesh* primarily along Iran's borders to counter any invading force, while the IRGC has a more ideological character and the more expansive mission of combating internal threats and expanding Iran's influence abroad.\nMissiles\nAccording to the U.S. intelligence community, \"Iran has the largest inventory of ballistic missiles in the region and continues to emphasize improving the accuracy, lethality, and reliability of these systems.\"[93] Per CENTCOM Commander General Michael E. Kurilla, Iran has aggressively developed its missile capabilities to achieve \"an asymmetric advantage against regional militaries.\"[94] Iran has used its ballistic missiles to target U.S. regional assets directly, including a January 2020 attack (shortly following the U.S. killing of IRGC-QF Commander Soleimani) against Iraqi sites where U.S. military forces were stationed, and provides them to partner groups across the Middle East region.\nIran's medium-range ballistic missiles were assessed by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) in 2019 to have a maximum range of around 2,000 kilometers; General Kurilla repeated that estimate in 2024 testimony.[95] U.S. officials and others have expressed concern that Iran's government could use its nascent space program to develop longer-range missiles, including intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).[96] According to a congressionally mandated report issued by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence in June 2023, \"Iran's work on multiple space-launch vehicles…. probably would shorten the timeline to produce an intercontinental ballistic missile, if it decided to develop one, because the systems use similar technologies\"[97] \nIn 2024, Iran twice used missiles to directly target Israel. In the first attack, Iran launched 36 cruise missiles and around 120 ballistic missiles; U.S. officials reportedly assessed that half of the ballistic missiles failed to reach Israel, and most that did were shot down.[98] In October, Iran reportedly launched around 180 ballistic missiles, of which around 30 impacted in Israel, causing limited damage.[99] In response to the second attack, Israel launched airstrikes on Iran, including some targeting Iran's missile program. Those strikes reportedly destroyed solid fuel production sites that could take up to a year to replace, meaning that \"Iran cannot produce missiles,\" per a U.S. official in late 2024.[100] \n|\nIran's Missile Program and UN Sanctions \"Snapback\"[101] \nIn July 2015, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 2231 (UNSCR 2231), which, in addition to endorsing full implementation of the JCPOA, also contained provisions related to Iran's arms and missile development activities. Specifically, Annex B of the Resolution provides for a ban on the transfer of conventional arms to or from Iran (the conventional weapons ban expired in October 2020), and restricts exports of missile-related items until October 2023. UNSCR 2231 also includes provisions that effectively allow any \"JCPOA participant state\" to force the reimposition of UN sanctions, including the arms transfer and ballistic missile bans as well as broader asset freezes and travel bans, in a process known as \"snapback.\"\nIn August 2020, the Trump Administration invoked the snapback provision in an attempt to extend the conventional arms embargo, but most other members of the Security Council asserted that the United States, having ceased implementing its JCPOA commitments in 2018, was not a participant and therefore did not have the standing to trigger the snapback of sanctions, and the conventional arms ban expired in October 2020.[102] The Biden Administration reversed the Trump Administration's position on the snapback provision. On October 18, 2023, UN sanctions related to Iran's missile-related activities also expired; on the day of expiration the United States and 47 other countries issued a statement expressing their commitment to \"take all necessary measures to prevent\" the transfer of drones and related technology to and from Iran.[103] \nAccording to UNSCR 2231's provisions, Termination Day will occur on October 18, 2025. Accordingly, on that day, sanctions imposed pursuant to UNSCR 2231 are terminated and the Security Council \"will have concluded its consideration of the Iranian nuclear issue\" unless the snapback provision has been invoked. UNSCR 2231 and the snapback mechanism will cease to be operational after Termination Day.[104] The British, French, and German UN representatives wrote in December 2024 of their \"determination to use all diplomatic tools to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, including using snapback if necessary.\"[105] \n|\nIran's Nuclear Program[106] \nU.S. policymakers have signaled concern for decades that Tehran might attempt to develop nuclear weapons. Iran's production of enriched uranium using its gas centrifuge uranium enrichment facilities is currently the main source of concern that Tehran is pursuing nuclear weapons. Gas centrifuges can produce both low-enriched uranium (LEU), which can be used in nuclear power reactors, and weapons-grade highly enriched uranium (HEU), which is one of the two types of fissile material used in nuclear weapons. Iranian leaders claim that the country's enriched uranium production is only for Tehran's current and future civil nuclear reactors. According to official U.S. assessments, Tehran had a nuclear weapons program until late 2003.[107] \nAccording to IAEA reports, since the United States stopped performing its JCPOA commitments in 2018, some of Iran's nuclear activities, including its enriched uranium stockpile and number of enrichment locations, have exceeded JCPOA-mandated limits. The IAEA has also reported that the agency is unable to perform some JCPOA verification and monitoring activities. According to data reported in a March 3, 2025, statement from IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi, Iran has increased its stockpile of enriched uranium containing 60% uranium-235 by approximately 50% since the IAEA's previous report issued in November 2024.[108] Producing weapons-grade HEU (which contains approximately 90% uranium-235) from HEU containing 60% uranium-235 requires relatively little additional effort.[109] \nRegarding Iran's \"breakout\" time, then-Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Director William Burns stated during an October 7, 2024 event that Iran could produce enough weapons-grade HEU for a nuclear weapon in \"a week or a little more.\"[110] Iran must also complete the other necessary steps for producing a nuclear weapon, which could take as much as a year. Until 2024, the U.S. intelligence community assessed that Iran had not resumed work on its weaponization research. But July and November 2024 reports from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) indicate that Iran may have resumed work on such research.[111] \nStrategic setbacks to Iran and its regional partners in 2024 appear to have shifted the discourse in Iran around the possible development of nuclear weapons. In March 2025 congressional testimony, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard reiterated the intelligence community's assessment that \"Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and Supreme Leader Khamanei has not authorized the nuclear weapons program he suspended in 2003.\" However, Gabbard added that \"[i]n the past year, we have seen an erosion of a decades-long taboo in Iran on discussing nuclear weapons in public, likely emboldening nuclear weapons advocates within Iran's decision-making apparatus.\"[112] Increasingly public discussion about weaponization could also, per one analysis, be a \"theatrical … warning to outside powers\" as part of efforts to compel the United States to enter talks related to a new nuclear agreement.[113] Some observers have suggested that, given the risk that Iran's moves toward nuclear weapons development could prompt U.S. and/or Israeli military action, Iran might take steps to edge closer to weaponization (e.g., withdrawing from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty) without actually developing nuclear weapons.[114] \nU.S. Sanctions[115] \nSince 1979, U.S. Administrations have imposed economic sanctions in an effort to change Iran's behavior, often at the direction of Congress. U.S. sanctions on Iran are multifaceted and complex, a result of over four decades of legislative, administrative, and law enforcement actions by successive presidential Administrations and Congresses.\nU.S. sanctions on Iran were first imposed during the U.S.-Iran hostage crisis of 1979-1981, when President Jimmy Carter issued executive orders blocking nearly all Iranian assets held in the United States. In 1984, Secretary of State George Shultz designated the government of Iran a state sponsor of acts of international terrorism (SSOT) following the October 1983 bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Lebanon. Iran's status as an SSOT triggers several sanctions including restrictions on licenses for U.S. dual-use exports; a ban on U.S. foreign assistance, arms sales, and support in international financial institutions; and the withholding of U.S. foreign assistance to countries that assist or sell arms to the designee. Later in the 1980s and throughout the 1990s, other U.S. sanctions sought to limit Iran's conventional arsenal and its ability to project power throughout the Middle East.\nIn the 2000s, as Iran's nuclear program progressed, U.S. sanctions focused largely on trying to pressure Iran to limit its nuclear activities. Most of the U.S. sanctions enacted after 2010 were secondary sanctions on foreign firms that conduct transactions with major sectors of the Iranian economy, including banking, energy, and shipping. Successive Administrations issued Executive Orders under which they designated specific individuals and entities to implement and supplement the provisions of these laws. The United States has also, pursuant to various authorities, imposed sanctions on scores of entities held responsible for human rights violations.\nIn accordance with the 2015 JCPOA, the United States waived its secondary sanctions, including sanctions on Iran's exportation of oil and on its financial sector; the European Union (EU) lifted its ban on purchases of oil from Iran and Iranian banks were readmitted to the SWIFT financial messaging services system;[116] and the UN Security Council revoked its resolutions that required member states to impose certain restrictions. The JCPOA did not require the lifting of U.S. sanctions on direct U.S.-Iran trade or sanctions levied for Iran's support for terrorist groups, its human rights abuses, or its missile and advanced conventional weapons programs. In 2018, the United States reimposed sanctions that had been waived pursuant to JCPOA implementation.\nU.S. sanctions imposed during 2011-2015, and since 2018, have taken a substantial toll on Iran's economy. According to one assessment, economic outcomes in Iran \"are determined primarily by the multiple negative consequences of sanctions.\"[117] Some analysts, while agreeing that sanctions have an impact, also have argued that Iran suffers from \"decades of failed economic policies.\"[118] \nSanctions appear to have had a mixed impact on the range of Iranian actions their imposition has been intended to curb. As mentioned above, some experts attribute Iran's decision to enter into multilateral negotiations and agree to limits on its nuclear program under the JCPOA at least in part to sanctions pressure. Other aspects of Iranian policy seen as threatening to U.S. interests, including its regional influence and military capabilities appear to have remained considerable, though are increasingly in question.[119] The reimposition of U.S. sanctions after 2018 may also have contributed to Iran's growing closeness to Russia and China.\nAs part of its oversight responsibilities and to better inform legislative action, Congress has directed successive Administrations to provide reports on a wide array of Iran-related topics, including U.S. sanctions and their impact (for more, see CRS Report R48282, [*Iran: Congressional Reporting Requirements*], by Clayton Thomas). Congress has also held numerous hearings focused primarily or in part on U.S. sanctions on Iran.\nActivity in the 118th and 119th Congress\nCongressional action in the 118th Congress targeted a number of Iranian government actions, including its crackdown on popular protests, its continued oil exports, and its support** **for terrorist groups across the Middle East. Dozens of measures related to Iran sanctions were introduced in the 118th Congress, with the House passing at least 13 of them.[120] \nIran's April 2024 attack against Israel helped spur congressional action on a large emergency supplemental appropriations package ([P.L. 118-50]) that included a number of Iran sanctions-related measures:\n* The Stop Harboring Iranian Petroleum, or SHIP, Act (Division J), which, among other provisions, directs the President to impose sanctions on persons the President determines have engaged in certain transactions related to Iranian petroleum exports.\n* The Fight and Combat Rampant Iranian Missile Exports, or Fight CRIME, Act (Division K), which, among other provisions, directs the President to impose sanctions on persons the President determines engage in efforts to transfer missile-related technology to or from Iran.\n* The Mahsa Amini Human Rights and Security Accountability, or MAHSA, Act (Division L), which, among other provisions, directs the President to review whether specified Iranian entities meet the criteria for designation under certain existing sanctions authorities.\nIn the 119th Congress, the House has passed one measure related to Iran, [H.R. 1800], which would eliminate the sunset clause in the 1996 Iran Sanctions Act. Other legislation related to Iran in the 119th Congress includes\n* The Enhanced Iran Sanctions Act of 2025 ([H.R. 1422] /[S. 556], the former of which was ordered to be reported by the House Foreign Affairs Committee in April 2025), which would direct the President to impose sanctions on certain individuals related to Iran's oil exports;\n* Resolutions affirming \"threats to world stability from a nuclear weapons-capable Islamic Republic of Iran\" ([H.Res. 105] /[S.Res. 43]);\n* Resolutions supporting \"the Iranian people's desires for a democratic, secular, and nonnuclear Republic of Iran\" ([H.Res. 166]) and the protection of \"Iranian political refugees, including female former political prisoners, in Ashraf-3 in Albania\" ([S.Res. 145]); and\n* Resolutions calling on France, Germany, and the United Kingdom to invoke snapback sanctions on Iran (see **text**** ****box** above) \"as soon as possible\" ([H.Res. 139] /[S.Res. 81]).\nBeyond legislation, some Members in the 119th Congress have engaged in a number of public events related to Iran, including a February 26, 2025, event with the Iranian Women Congressional Caucus featuring Maryam Rajavi, head of the National Council of Resistance of Iran; an April 1, 2025, House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing entitled \"A Return to Maximum Pressure: Comprehensively Countering the Iranian Regime's Malign Activities;\" and a May 8, 2025, event with the nonprofit group United Against Nuclear Iran featuring an Iranian drone.[121] \nOutlook\nAs of May 2025, U.S. policy toward Iran appears to be at an inflection point: U.S.-Iran talks could result in a diplomatic accord or could fail to do so, perhaps leading to U.S. and/or Israeli military action against Iran. Negotiations could also continue for an extended period, perhaps in connection with a preliminary agreement. In any case, developments will likely have implications for Congress, including formal decision points for legislative action.\nIf the United States and Iran do reach a formal agreement, the Administration would be required to submit it for congressional review pursuant to the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015 (INARA, [P.L. 114-17]). INARA directs that \"Not later than 5 calendar days after reaching an agreement with Iran relating to the nuclear program of Iran, the President shall submit\" the text of the agreement and various certifications; directs congressional committees to hold hearings \"as appropriate\" to review the agreement; and provides for expedited consideration of a resolution of disapproval (subject to a presidential veto) during a 60-day congressional review period.[122] In evaluating a potential deal regarding Iran's nuclear program and whether it advances U.S. national security interests, Members may consider various factors, including how Iran's nuclear stockpiles, enrichment capabilities, and other aspects of its nuclear program are restricted; the temporal length of those restrictions; the mechanisms to verify Iran's compliance; and the views of U.S. allies and regional partners.\nOne of the most important regional partners is Israel. Depending on whether or not an accord emerges and its possible contours, U.S. and Israeli interests could align or diverge, particularly if Israeli officials (some of whom have reportedly favored military action against Iran) assess that the \"risk of inaction is greater\" than the risks associated with military action.[123] Israeli officials might take that view if they assess that Iran could quickly move forward on nuclear weaponization, that Iran could reverse some of the setbacks it suffered in military exchanges with Israel last year (that reportedly destroyed most of Iran's air defense and missile production capabilities), or that the components of a U.S.-Iran agreement do not meet Israel's national security needs. Israeli officials have called for Iran to completely dismantle its nuclear program. However, according to one analyst, they likely do not expect full dismantlement from Iran, and they may hope that their advocacy leads to a stalemate in negotiations that leads the United States to examine \"other options.\"[124] \nIranian leaders, as mentioned above, have publicly rejected giving up Iran's ability to enrich uranium. Still, the Iranian government could assess that recent setbacks leave them little choice but to accede to what they may have previously considered as unacceptable restrictions on their nuclear program, perhaps akin to Khomeini's acceptance of a 1988 cease-fire with Iraq, which he described as \"more deadly than taking poison.\"[125] While the Iranian government has shown few signs of moderating or otherwise altering its foundational opposition to the United States and Israel, the regime has also at times prioritized self-preservation over ideology.[126] \nIf talks, for whatever reason, break down, the likelihood of U.S. and/or Israeli military action against Iran's nuclear facilities could increase. In early April, President Trump said \"Israel will obviously be very much involved\" in such a military operation.[127] Later that month, he said that Israel would not drag him into a war, and that \"If we don't make a deal [with Iran], I'll be leading the pack.\"[128] Earlier, according to news accounts, President Trump reportedly discouraged an Israeli plan to strike Iran's nuclear facilities that may have anticipated U.S. support[129] One expert has written that a \"preventative attack is unlikely to be a solitary event but rather the opening round of a long campaign,\" in part because Iran's nuclear infrastructure is widely distributed across the country and some sites are \"hardened and buried,\" meaning that \"residual capacity is likely to survive an attack.\"[130] Media reports in May 2025 indicate that Israeli officials may be preparing to \"move fast\" with an Israeli military strike if U.S.-Iran talks fall apart, with one report (citing an unnamed U.S. official) questioning whether Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu might act without a \"green light\" from President Trump.[131] \nIranian leaders have pledged to retaliate against U.S. and/or Israeli military action, which could include Iranian attacks against U.S. military forces in the Gulf and elsewhere, against U.S. allies, or moves to close the Strait of Hormuz.[132] Such moves could have implications for global energy markets and could hamper Iran's already troubled economy and undermine Iran's post-2021 attempts to reconcile and establish productive ties with its Gulf neighbors.[133] \nCongress might consider questions about the authorization of U.S. military force against Iran, other war powers issues, and U.S. support to Israel and other regional partners potentially threatened by Iran. In the 118th Congress, Senator Lindsey Graham introduced a joint resolution ([S.J.Res. 106]) to authorize the use of military force against Iran if the President determines that Iran \"is in the process of possessing a nuclear weapon\" or \"possess uranium enriched to weapons-grade level.\"[134] To date, no similar measure has been introduced in the 119th Congress. Members have debated the potential advantages and drawbacks of such a resolution.[135] \n# Footnotes\n|[1].\n|\nAndreas Krief, \"Network model shows resilience as Iran-Israel clash expands,\" *Amwaj.media*, July 15, 2024; Renad Mansour et al., \"The shape-shifting 'axis of resistance': How Iran and its networks adapt to external pressures,\" Chatham House, March 2025.\n|\n|[2].\n|\nNakissa Jahanbani et al., \"How Iranian-backed militias do political signaling,\" *Lawfare*, December 18, 2023.\n|\n|[3].\n|\nIdrees Ali et al., \"Trump vows to hold Iran responsible for Houthi attacks,\" Reuters, March 18, 2025.\n|\n|[4].\n|\nState Department, *Country Reports on Terrorism 2023*.\n|\n|[5].\n|\nPatrick Wintour, \"As Middle East Crisis Grows, Does Iran have Control of its Proxy Forces?\" *Guardian*, January 6, 2024.\n|\n|[6].\n|\nSara Harmouch and Nakissa Jahanbani, \"How much influence does Iran have over its proxies?\" *Defense One*, January 23, 2024.\n|\n|[7].\n|\nOffice of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), *Annual Threat Assessment of the U.S. Intelligence Community*, March 25, 2025.

Iran retaliated with missile attacks across the Middle East, escalating regional tensions. The conflict follows weeks of US threats over Iran’s nuclear program and domestic crackdowns. Civilian casualties, airspace closures, and international condemnation underscore the crisis’s severity. \n\n**Key Facts and Data Points** \n1. **Attack Details**: \n - US-Israel strikes began at 06:00 GMT, hitting Tehran, Isfahan, Qom, and other Iranian cities. \n - A local official reported 53 deaths in a strike on a girls’ primary school in Minab (unverified by BBC). \n - Iranian state media confirmed closures of airspace nationwide. \n\n2. **Retaliation**: \n - Iran launched missiles at Israel, Bahrain (US Navy 5th Fleet base), Qatar (Al Udeid Air Base), Jordan, Kuwait, and the UAE. \n - Jordan, Kuwait, and UAE intercepted missiles; UAE reported one fatality from falling debris. \n\n3. **Travel and Security**: \n - Major airlines (Wizz Air, British Airways, Lufthansa) cancelled or diverted flights to the Middle East. \n - Israel imposed a state of emergency, closing airspace and advising civilians to avoid gatherings. \n\n4. **International Reactions**: \n - UN Human Rights Chief Volker Türk condemned strikes, emphasizing civilian protection. \n - EU, UK, France, and Germany urged de-escalation but distanced themselves from the attack. Saudi Arabia and Oman criticized Iran’s retaliation. \n - Russia condemned the US-Israel operation, calling it “reckless.” \n\n**Notable Verbatim Quotes** \n1. **Donald Trump**: “Our objective is to defend the American people by eliminating imminent threats from the Iranian regime.” \n2. **Benjamin Netanyahu**: “Our joint action will create the conditions for the courageous Iranian people to take their destiny into their own hands.” \n3. **Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi**: Retaliatory strikes are Iran’s “legitimate right of self-defence.” \n\n**Framing and Perspective** \nThe BBC adopts a neutral tone, focusing on verified reports while cautioning about unconfirmed casualty figures (e.g., the Minab school strike). The article emphasizes civilian impacts (“civilians who end up paying the ultimate price”) and regional destabilization, reflecting humanitarian concerns. It contextualizes the conflict within prolonged US-Iran tensions, nuclear negotiations, and Iran’s domestic unrest.

We've had reporting from the region, analysis from Washington and elsewhere. We'll continue; that's what you get from NPR News.\nOur next guest is Danny Danon, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, who's on the line. Ambassador, welcome back to the program.\nDANNY DANON: Good morning. Thank you for having me, Steve.\nINSKEEP: What, in Israel's view, justified an attack on another country at this time?\nDANON: Well, we obtained the information about a secret program that included all the necessary parts to put together a bomb. You know, we're talking about the uranium enrichment, the triggering mechanisms and the warhead delivery systems. And like you mentioned earlier, the IAEA decided and reported that Iran possesses enough material for multiple nuclear weapons. So we decided to take a preemptive action, preemptive attack and not to wait and not to be surprised. After October 7, we learned that lesson. We are not going to wait for our enemies to surprise us again. That's why we targeted the nuclear sites and also the industry of the ballistic missiles that Iran developed.\nINSKEEP: Well, let's talk about the information that you say you obtained about an Iranian secret program - the various components of a bomb. We will note that Iran always denies they have any ambition to build a nuclear weapon, although they insist that they have the right to a nuclear program. You are asserting that they had the capability together. Are you asserting that they were on their way to making a bomb or only that the secret program had the capacity to do so?\nDANON: No, moreover, we have the intelligence that it wasn't like nuclear reactors for civil usage. It was a military program that was hidden from the international community. And once we realized that, that they're playing the game and they're getting very close to the point of no return, we couldn't take that risk. You know, a few hours ago, they send more than 100 drones. We expect ballistic missiles to fly into Israel in the next few days. So we cannot wait for the day that they will actually be able to put the nuclear capability on those ballistic missiles that they have already.\nINSKEEP: I just want to make sure that I understand what you're saying, though. You're saying they had this program for building a nuclear weapon. Was Iran actively assembling a nuclear weapon, according to your intelligence?\nDANON: Absolutely. They were moving forward. And I think what we realize that now, when they have enough uranium, they have the technology. And you know what? We believe them. They said very clearly, we will destroy the Jewish nation. They didn't hide it. So we decided not to take that chance. History have taught us that when you have a regime which threatens to annihilate the Jewish people, we better believe them. And that's why we took this preemptive attack to make sure that we will not be in a point that Iran will be able to implement those radical ideas.\nINSKEEP: Do you have any initial assessment as to whether you successfully damaged or destroyed the nuclear facilities, some of which would be well underground?\nDANON: Well, you know, it's too early to call it. You know, it's a long operation. It's going to be very intense in Israel in the next few days. We expect retaliation, and we will continue. You know, we have the ability to attack targets in Iran today. We will continue until we will be sure that Iran is not in a position of posing a threat to Israel and to the Western societies.\nINSKEEP: When you say you're going to continue, I want to understand what the rhythm is here. Are you suggesting that what Israel will do is assess the damage, decide if more strikes are needed, and then strike further as you judge? Is that what you see ahead?\nDANON: Well, I will not go into details, but, you know, once we decided to take those actions, we realized the consequences. But for the future generations, we took that decision in order to allow Israel to survive. And that's why we are determined to finish the job to make sure that Iran would not be a threat, not only to Israel. You know, they are threatening many allies of the U.S. in the region. I think now it's about time to create a new reality.\nINSKEEP: Ambassador, I want to keep you on the line for another couple of minutes to ask where the United States fits into this. We'll recall that President Trump had been trying for an agreement to limit or eliminate Iran's nuclear program. The strike comes just as the U.S. was preparing for another round of talks. What relationship is there, if any, in the timing? Did you consider the United States' position in deciding on the timing here?\nDANON: Well, we have a ongoing dialogue with our colleagues in D.C., but this decision was made in Jerusalem. It was an independent decision of Israel. We decided that we cannot wait anymore. It was an act of self-defense. And I want to remind you, Steve, you know, it happened in the past. In the '80s, Prime Minister Begin took a similar decision to attack the nuclear reactor in Iraq. We were isolated for a while. We were condemned by the U.N. and other international institutions. But when you look at it for today, you realize it was the right decision. Same with our attack against a nuclear reactor in Syria. So I think what we did there last night was a historic decision that will make the world a safer place for everybody.\nINSKEEP: President Trump, though, has urged Iran again this morning to take the opportunity to make a deal. He's effectively said this attack is a warning. You'd better act before you lose everything. Hurry up and make a deal. Does Israel want the United States to make an agreement over Iran's nuclear program with Iran?\nDANON: Well, we look at the end result. You know, we want to have a situation where we can live peacefully. You know, when you look at the map, you see the distance between Iran and Israel. We have no dispute with the Iranian people whatsoever - you know, no borders, no conflict. It's only the radical ideology that leads them to spend billions of dollars against Israel, providing it to the proxies and building the ballistic missiles. And if you will allow me, I will elaborate on that.\nIran wanted to reach a position that they will have the same amount of ballistic missiles like the United States in order to threaten Israel. So it was an imminent threat. That's why we took this action.\nINSKEEP: And just to be clear - we've got about 10 seconds - do you want the United States to make a nuclear agreement with Iran?\nDANON: So we want to get to a position that there is no threat against Israel. If you can achieve it diplomatically, we always prefer that. But we saw in the last few decades that the Iranians lied. They played the game, but at the same time, they continued to build their capabilities.\nINSKEEP: Danny Danon is Israel's ambassador to the United Nations. He's on the line this morning. Ambassador, thanks so much for your time - really appreciate it.\nDANON: Thank you very much, Steve.\nCopyright &copy; 2025 NPR. All rights reserved.

He's repeatedly said Iran wants to negotiate and has brought up Tehran's nuclear program as another issue he wants to see resolved.\nBut Khamenei also referred to the nationwide protests as \"a coup,\" hardening the government's position as tens of thousands of people reportedly have been detained since the start of the demonstrations. Seditious charges in Iran can carry the death penalty, which again renews concerns about Tehran carrying out mass executions for those arrested — a red line for Trump.\n[![Iranian protesters gather on Enghelab (Revolution) Street during a demonstration in Tehran, Iran, on Jan. 8, 2026. ]] \n### [Middle East ] \n### [Voices from Iran: women defy fear in the face of brutal crackdown] \nIran had also planned a live-fire military drill for Sunday and Monday in the strategic Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which a fifth of all oil traded passes. The U.S. military's Central Command had warned against threatening American warships or aircraft during the drill or disrupting commercial traffic.\n### Khamenei warns US\nIranian state television reported Khamenei's comments online before airing any footage of his remarks.\n\"The Americans should know that if they start a war, this time it will be a regional war,\" Khamenei was quoted as saying.\n![A woman walks through the Shiite Saints Abdulazim and Taher shrine in Shahr-e-Ray, south of Tehran, Iran, Thursday, Jan. 29, 2026.] \nA woman walks through the Shiite Saints Abdulazim and Taher shrine in Shahr-e-Ray, south of Tehran, Iran, Thursday, Jan. 29, 2026.\n**\nVahid Salemi/AP\n**\n****hide caption****\n****toggle caption****\nVahid Salemi/AP\nIt added that Khamenei said: \"We are not the instigators and we do not seek to attack any country. But the Iranian nation will deliver a firm blow to anyone who attacks or harasses it.\"\nSponsor Message\nKhamenei also hardened his position on the demonstrations after earlier acknowledging some people had legitimate economic grievances that sparked their protests. The demonstrations began Dec. 28, initially over the collapse of Iran's rial currency. It soon grew into a direct challenge to Khamenei's rule.\n\"The recent sedition was similar to a coup. Of course, the coup was suppressed,\" he said. \"Their goal was to destroy sensitive and effective centers involved in running the country, and for this reason they attacked the police, government centers, (Revolutionary Guard) facilities, banks and mosques — and burned copies of the Quran. They targeted centers that run the country.\"\n### Parliament speaker says EU militaries considered terrorist groups.\nThe speaker of Iran's parliament, meanwhile, said that the Islamic Republic now considers all European Union militaries to be terrorist groups, lashing out after the bloc declared the country's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard a terror group over its bloody crackdown on nationwide protests.\nMohammad Bagher Qalibaf, a former Guard commander, announced the terror designation, which will likely be mostly symbolic. Iran has used a 2019 law to reciprocally declare other nations' militaries terror groups following the United States declaration of the Guard a terror group that year.\nQalibaf made the announcement as he and others in parliament wore Guard uniforms in support of the force. The Guard, which also controls Iran's ballistic missile arsenal and has vast economic interests in Iran, answers only to Iran's 86-year-old Khamenei.\n\"By seeking to strike at the (Guard), which itself has been the greatest barrier to the spread of terrorism to Europe, Europeans have in fact shot themselves in the foot and, once again, through blind obedience to the Americans, decided against the interests of their own people,\" Qalibaf said.\nLawmakers at the session later chanted: \"Death to America!\" and \"Death to Israel!\" at the session.\nSponsor Message\n### Trump says Iran is 'seriously talking' to US\nTrump has laid out two red lines for military action: the killing of peaceful protesters or the possible mass execution of those detained in a major crackdown over the demonstrations. He's increasingly begun discussing Iran's nuclear program as well, which the U.S. negotiated over with Tehran in multiple sessions before Israel launched a 12-day war with Iran back in June.\nThe U.S. bombed three Iranian nuclear sites during the war. Activity at two of the sites suggests Iran may be trying to obscure the view of satellites as it tries to salvage what remains there.\nTrump on Saturday night declined to say whether he'd made a decision on what he wanted to do regarding Iran.\nSpeaking to reporters as he flew to Florida, Trump sidestepped a question about whether Tehran would be emboldened if the U.S. backed away from launching strikes on Iran, saying, \"Some people think that. Some people don't.\"\nTrump said Iran should negotiate a \"satisfactory\" deal to prevent the Middle Eastern country from getting any nuclear weapons, but said, \"I don't know that they will. But they are talking to us. Seriously talking to us.\"\nAli Larijani, a top security official in Iran, wrote on X late Saturday that \"structural arrangements for negotiations are progressing.\" However, there is no public sign of any direct talks with the United States, something Khamenei has repeatedly ruled out.\n* [Iran] \n* [trump] \n* **Facebook**\n* **Flipboard**\n* **Email**\nSponsor Message\nSponsor Message\n[Become an NPR sponsor]"

The U.S. has been threatening war over a list of demands that includes Iran's nuclear program. Vali Nasr is following all of this. He's at Johns Hopkins University and is a longtime scholar of Iran and its region - has been a guest many times here. Vali, welcome back.\nVALI NASR: Thank you. Good to be with you.\nINSKEEP: OK, from the outside, Iran seems pretty weak right now. They got pounded last year by Israel and the United States. They're facing protests at home, which they had to very violently repress. But do you believe that Iranian leaders think they are in a weak position?\nNASR: Yes, I think they do think they're in a weak position, not only because they were attacked militarily and their nuclear program was damaged, but also because the protest that we witnessed in Iran is also putting a tremendous amount of domestic pressure on them. So they are in a vulnerable position.\nINSKEEP: Does that mean that they would be willing to make concessions or make an agreement with the United States?\nNASR: Yes, they would be willing to make concessions, but I don't think they want to surrender. So it depends on what the United States is asking. But also, I think they are distrustful of the United States. They worry that they may get attacked anyways, whether they cut a deal, whether they negotiate or not. And I think they're approaching the talks with a great deal of trepidation.\nINSKEEP: Oh, this is very interesting. And I'm thinking about the scope of a deal. The Iranians seem to be willing to allow some limitations on their nuclear program, but the United States wants more - much, much more than that.\nNASR: That's true. If the United States asked for total surrender, it would be very difficult for Iran to agree to that. And, of course, one has to say, what is the United States offering in return for that degree of concession? But on top of it, I think the Iranians are looking for a language that allows both sides to claim victory at the table.\nINSKEEP: I want to follow up on something we heard on this program last week. We spoke with Mark Dubowitz, who was openly an advocate of war. He's with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. And I pointed out to him that Iran's neighbors - Persian Gulf countries - seem really not to want this war 'cause they don't want to get attacked. They've been urging talks led by the United States. And Dubowitz pointed out - he said, well, they say different things publicly and privately. And I understand some private remarks that I think he's referring to. But do you think the Persian Gulf neighbors of Iran would welcome war?\nNASR: No, I don't think they'd welcome war because they're not confident that the United States can attack Iran in a way that, A, Iran would not retaliate, and secondly, that it would not become a much more bigger, larger war that would damage their economic prospects going forward. It is not out of love of Iran that they are resisting war. It is out of pure self-interest and the fact that the United States is not able to show them credibly that it can protect the Gulf countries from the blowback from war.\nINSKEEP: What is the worst-case scenario here?\nNASR: I mean, the worst-case scenario is that - A, that the United States would get entangled in a long-term war. That - you know, the U.S. can start wars, can inflict a great deal of damage, but it cannot control how the wars unfold. And we can also have a collapse of the state in Iran in a country of 95 million with advanced missiles, with nuclear material. Chaos could look degrees larger and more dangerous than what we witnessed in Iraq or Syria.\nINSKEEP: Some people, including the outside opposition, would very much like a collapse of the government in Iran. Are you saying that may not be as desirable an outcome as it seems?\nNASR: Well, they're looking for a collapse of the government that is immediately replaced by an open, pro-Western democratic government, but that's not likely to happen. When we're talking about collapse of government, we're talking about scenarios like we witnessed in Iraq after U.S. invasion, Syria or Libya, not a smooth transition to a new order.\nINSKEEP: OK. Vali Nasr, we'll continue following your analysis and continue following the news from Geneva this week, where U.S. and Iranian negotiators will be in the same city, although we do not know if they will talk directly. Vali, thanks so much.\nNASR: Thank you.\nINSKEEP: He's at Johns Hopkins University and also the Center for Strategic International Studies.\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.\n*NPR transcripts are created on a rush deadline by an NPR contractor.

In that attack, Iran fired more than 180 missiles at Israel. Most were intercepted by Israel&#x27;s air defences and US-led allied forces. Some though hit air bases and other sites. One Palestinian was killed by a falling missile casing.\nIsrael said it would retaliate, but did not say when or how. There had been constant speculation since then on the timing of an Israeli attack and what form it might take - from limited strikes to massive attacks on Iran&#x27;s oil fields and nuclear sites.\nThe attack came in the early hours of Saturday and appears to have been restricted to missile manufacturing and launching sites, and what Israel called &quot;other aerial capabilities&quot;, without being specific.\n![]![line] \n## Why did Iran previously attack Israel and what was Israel&#x27;s response?\nIran said it attacked Israel on 1 October in retaliation for the killings of the leaders of Hezbollah and Hamas - Iranian-backed armed groups fighting Israel - and a senior Iranian commander.\nHezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and Brig Gen Abbas Nilforoushan were killed when Israel bombed the building they were in in the Lebanese capital, Beirut, on 27 September. Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an explosion in the compound where he was staying on a visit to Tehran on 31 July. Iran blamed Israel for that attack, though Israel has neither confirmed nor denied involvement.\nIran&#x27;s attack was its second-ever directly against Israel. It came five months after it first attacked Israel with waves of about 300 drones and missiles. Israel said almost all were intercepted. That attack was in response to an Israeli air strike on an Iranian consulate complex in the Syrian capital, Damascus, on 1 April, which killed 13 people, including seven members of Iran&#x27;s overseas Quds Force. Two of those killed were a senior Quds Force commander and his deputy. Iran said the attack was a violation of its sovereignty.\nThe Quds Force is part of Iran&#x27;s most powerful armed force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).\nThe IRGC channels arms and equipment, including high precision missiles, through Syria to Hezbollah.\nIsrael retaliated for Iran&#x27;s missile and drone attack nearly three weeks later by attacking targets in Iran&#x27;s central Isfahan region. US officials confirmed the Israeli attack, though Israel did not comment. Israeli drones are reported to have hit radar for Iran&#x27;s Russian-made S-300 air defence missile system, which Israel believes would pose a particularly dangerous threat to any of its fighters planes in nearby air space.\nThe attack on the radar was considered limited and designed to signal Israel&#x27;s ability to strike Iranian military assets.\n![]![line] \n## Why are Israel and Iran enemies?\nPrior to Iran&#x27;s direct attack on Israel on 1 April, Iran and Israel had been engaged in a years-long shadow war - attacking each other&#x27;s assets without admitting responsibility.\nThose attacks have ratcheted up considerably during the war in Gaza sparked by the Palestinian group Hamas&#x27;s assault on nearby Israeli communities last October.\nThe two countries were allies until the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran, which brought in a regime that has used opposing Israel as a key part of its ideology.\nIran does not recognise Israel&#x27;s right to exist and seeks its eradication. The country&#x27;s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has called Israel a &quot;cancerous tumour&quot; that &quot;will undoubtedly be uprooted and destroyed&quot;.\nIsrael believes that Iran poses an existential threat as evidenced by Tehran&#x27;s rhetoric, its build-up of proxy forces in the region including the Lebanese Shia militant group Hezbollah that are sworn to Israel&#x27;s destruction, and its funding and arming of Palestinian groups including Hamas.\nIt also accuses Iran of secretly trying to develop nuclear weapons, though Iran denies seeking to build a nuclear bomb.\n![]![line] \n## Do Iran and Israel have nuclear weapons? What are Israel and Iran&#x27;s military capabilities?\nIran is much bigger than Israel geographically and has a population of nearly 90 million, almost 10 times as big as Israel&#x27;s - but this does not translate into greater military power.\nIran has invested heavily in missiles and drones. It has a vast arsenal of its own, and has also been supplying significant amounts to its proxies - the Houthis in Yemen and Hezbollah in Lebanon.\nIt has significantly upgraded its air defence systems and fighter jets. Russia is believed to be co-operating with Iran to improve those in return for the military support Tehran has given Moscow in its war on Ukraine. It has provided Iran with Su-35 fighter planes and the advanced S-300 air defence missile system.\nIsrael though has one of the most advanced air forces in the world. According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) military balance report, Israel has at least 14 squadrons of jets - including F-15s, F-16s and the latest F-35 stealth jet.\nIsrael also has experience of conducting strikes deep inside hostile territory. The shortest distance between Iran and Israel is about 1,000km (620 miles). Tel Aviv to Tehran is about 1,600km - further than the operational capability of any of Israel&#x27;s fleet without refuelling.\nIsrael is assumed to have nuclear weapons but maintains an official policy of ambiguity. Iran does not have nuclear weapons though Western states suspect it of secretly aiming to develop them. Iran emphatically denies it is trying or even wants to obtain nuclear weapons.\nLike Israel, Iran has a civilian nuclear programme, though it has been under suspicion for decades of covertly running a parallel programme to manufacture material - enriched uranium - for nuclear bombs, and the missiles to deliver them.\nIn May, the head of the global nuclear watchdog said Iran was &quot;weeks rather than months&quot; away from having enough material for a nuclear bomb. However, this does not mean Iran is weeks away from a bomb. It would still require a final step of enriching that material to military grade, and having warheads, which it is not believed to possess.\nIsrael is not a signatory to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), though Iran is. The NPT aims to stop the spread of nuclear weapons and requires members to open their nuclear facilities to inspection to verify they are being used for purely peaceful purposes.\nA 2015 UN-backed deal with Iran under which it agreed to measures limiting its nuclear activities in return for a lifting of economic sanctions largely collapsed after then-President Trump pulled the US out in 2018. Iran has stepped up its nuclear programme since then.\n![]![line] \n## Who are Iran&#x27;s allies?\nIran has built up a network of allies and proxy forces in the Middle East that it says form part of an &quot;axis of resistance&quot; challenging US and Israeli interests in the region. It supports them to varying degrees.\nSyria is Iran&#x27;s most important ally. Iran, along with Russia, helped the Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad survive the country&#x27;s decade-long civil war.\nIran&#x27;s relationship with Russia is also becoming increasingly significant. In December the Russian foreign ministry said the countries would speed up work on a &quot;major new interstate agreement&quot;.\nIran has provided Russia with Shahed attack drones. In February, Reuters quoted sources as saying Iran had also provided ballistic missiles. Iran denied the report. Meanwhile Iran says Russia plans to provide Iran with more advanced aircraft.\n![]![A map showing where pro-Iranian militant groups operate: Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, the Palestinian territories, Bahrain and Yemen.] \nOf the armed groups that Iran backs, Hezbollah in Lebanon is the most powerful. It has been trading cross-border fire with Israel on an almost daily basis since war erupted between Israel and Hamas. Tens of thousands of civilians on both sides of the border have been forced to leave their homes.\nIran backs several Shia militia in Iraq which have attacked US bases in Iraq, Syria and Jordan with rocket fire. The US retaliated after three of its soldiers were killed at a military outpost in Jordan.\nIn Yemen, Iran provides support to the Houthi movement, which controls the most populated areas of the country. The Houthis have fired missiles and drones at Israel and have also been attacking commercial shipping near Yemen&#x27;s shores, sinking at least one vessel. The US and UK have struck Houthi targets in response.\nIran also provides weapons and training to Palestinian armed groups including Hamas, which attacked Israel on 7 October last year. However, Iran denies any role in the 7 October attack itself.\n*Additional reporting by Tom Spender and Jonathan Beale, defence correspondent*\n[\n## What we know about Israel&#x27;s missile attack on Iran\n] \n[\n## Bowen: Crisis shows how badly Iran and Israel understand each other\n] \n[\n## What was in wave of Iranian attacks and how were they thwarted?\n] \n[Middle East] \n[Israel] \n[Iran] \nRelated\n[\n## Huge blast at key Iranian port kills 28 and injures 800\n2 hrs ago\nMiddle East\n] \n[\n## Israeli military admits its troops killed UN worker in Gaza Strip\n2 days ago\nWorld\n] \n[\n## PM to visit aircraft carrier on voyage of &#x27;unity&#x27;\n3 days ago\nHampshire &amp; Isle of Wight\n] \nMore\n[\n21 hrs ago\n![]![A fireball seen from the viewpoint of a driver in front of a row of cars] \n## Moment driver sees huge explosion rip through Iran port\nAt least four people have been killed and 500 more injured in Bandar Abbas.\n21 hrs ago\nMiddle East\n] \n[\n2 days ago\n![]![Displaced Palestinians hold out pans at a community kitchen in Jabalia refugee camp, northern Gaza (24 April 2025)] \n## UN agency runs out of food aid in Gaza after Israeli blockade\nThe UN agency has delivered its last supplies to meals kitchens, which it warns will run out of food in the coming days.\n2 days ago\nMiddle East\n] \n[\n2 days ago\n![]![Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, wearing a black suit, and Pope Francis, wearing his white papal garments, shake hands as they meet in Jerusalem in 2014] \n## Israel&#x27;s muted response to Pope Francis&#x27;s death signals tensions over Gaza\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&#x27;s office has sent condolences four days after the Pope&#x27;s death.\n2 days ago\nMiddle East\n] \n[\n2 days ago\n![]![Palestinians inspect the aftermath of an Israeli strike on a house in Gaza City, northern Gaza (24 April 2025)] \n## Israeli strikes across Gaza kill at least 50, Palestinian officials say\nTwenty-one people are reportedly killed in two separate strikes in the northern town of Jabalia.\n2 days ago\nMiddle East\n] \n[\n2 days ago\n![]![Composite image showing Palestinians in Gaza standing next to destroyed buildings and asbestos fibres under a microscope] \n## &#x27;Very, very toxic&#x27;: The risk of asbestos in Gaza&#x27;s rubble\nThe mineral, once widely-used, releases toxic fibres into the air when disturbed that can cling to the lungs and cause cancer.\n2 days ago\nMiddle East\n]"

Because the targets have been so widespread by Israel, no area can be considered safe.\nIn Tehran, the government announced they were opening the metro stations 24 hours a day so people can take shelter.\nTehran has 10 million people, so you can imagine evacuating that number of people is not really possible.\n**- Nafiseh Kohnavard, Middle East correspondent**\n![A crowd of Iranians in Tehran] Image source,Reuters\nImage caption,\nTen million people live in Tehran\n## If US enters the conflict, would Iran strike US targets?\nThere is certainly risk, and the consequences for the US are fairly significant.\nThere are about 40,000 to 50,000 US troops at around 19 locations across the Middle East. There are US personnel based in Cyprus, and a US naval facility in Bahrain.\nIt will all depend on how the US decides to get involved, and to what extent.\n**- Mikey Kay, Security Brief host**\n## Could Iran&#x27;s proxies support it in conflict with Israel?\nI don&#x27;t think so - not any longer.\nSince Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, 2023, Israel has systematically taken down a lot of the first line of defence that Iran had.\nThey have depleted Hamas in Gaza, they have largely depleted Hezbollah&#x27;s arsenal in Lebanon, and Syria is no longer an ally of Iran because Bashar al-Assad has been deposed, albeit not by Israel.\nThe Houthis meanwhile are relatively constrained in Yemen. So they are not very well coordinated.\n**- Frank Gardner, security correspondent**\n![An Israeli strike on Hezbollah in Lebanon earlier this month] Image source,EPA\nImage caption,\nAn Israeli strike on Hezbollah in Lebanon earlier this month\n## Who is Iran&#x27;s leader and how much support does he have?\nIran&#x27;s supreme leader is Ali Khamenei. He is a religious figure, but he has much more power than Iran&#x27;s president.\nHe is the commander-in-chief of the armed forces and is a decision-maker for the country, including negotiations with the US.\nBut he does not command the support of all of Iran - his people are divided, and that division is deepening.\nIran witnessed huge protests against the regime only two years ago. Women participated in those protests, demanding their rights and freedoms.\nBut we cannot ignore that this regime still has its supporters - including in the armed forces which are connected to the regime.\n**- Nafiseh Kohnavard, Middle East correspondent**\n![Ali Khamenei] Image source,Reuters\nImage caption,\nAli Khamenei\n## What happens if the regime is overthrown in Iran?\nThere&#x27;s no clear answer.\nWe&#x27;ve seen over the last few years that there is no united opposition who could work together to replace the government.\nRight now there are different options, including Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the former Shah of Iran, who is now living abroad.\nHe has supporters inside and outside Iran, but how many we can&#x27;t really say.\nHe has opponents as well, including reformists inside. They may not want to go back to Iran&#x27;s monarchy that was overthrown nearly 40 years ago.\nSo it&#x27;s not clear if there is one replacement.\n**- Nafiseh Kohnavard, Middle East correspondent**\n## Where is Fordo and what is it?\nFordo is about 200km (124 miles) south of Tehran and is one of two critical enrichment facilities Iran has.\nIt has been built into a mountain for its protection. And it is basically one of the key enrichment facilities that Iran has been using to boost its enriched uranium stockpile.\nFordo has been struck by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) already. However, it is believed the attacks were going after Iran&#x27;s surface-to-air missiles and air defence capabilities around it, in order to make it more vulnerable.\n**- Mikey Kay, Security Brief host**\n![Satellite image of Fordo, buried deep beneath a mountain] Image source,Maxar\nImage caption,\nFordo is buried deep beneath a mountain\n## How close is Iran to getting a nuclear bomb?\nThe only people who know for certain whether or not Iran was working towards building a nuclear bomb are Iran&#x27;s most trusted nuclear scientists, the inner core of security officials and the supreme leader himself. The rest is conjecture.\nBut the alarm was raised earlier this month when the UN&#x27;s nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, found Iran to be in breach of its non-proliferation obligations, for the first time in nearly 20 years. Iran has amassed around 400kg of uranium enriched to 60%, well beyond the level needed for civil nuclear purposes.\nThe UN agency said Iran had failed to cooperate fully and that it was unable to verify there had been no diversion of nuclear material to nuclear weapons. That is not the same though, as stating Iran was racing towards building a bomb.\nThe Israeli military said last week that &quot;over the past few months intelligence has shown that Iran is closer than ever to obtaining a nuclear weapon&quot;.\nBut whose intelligence? Not apparently, its closest ally&#x27;s. In March, the US director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, told Congress that &quot;while Iran had an unprecedented stockpile of weapons-grade uranium, it did not appear to be building a nuclear weapon&quot;.\nIran, meanwhile, has always maintained that its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful.\n**- Frank Gardner, security correspondent**\n## Does Israel have nuclear weapons?\nThere are estimates that it has about 90 nuclear warheads. But the real answer is we do not know.\nIt has neither confirmed nor denied a nuclear capability,\nIsrael is not part of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, which was a global agreement to prevent more nations acquiring the bomb.\nIt takes three components to have a nuclear weapon: first, uranium enriched to 90%, second, the ability to build a warhead, and third, a way to deliver that warhead to a target.\nAs it stands, there is no overt declaration by Israel on any of the above.\n**- Mikey Kay, Security Brief host**\n## Related topics\n* [Middle East] \n* [Israel] \n* [Iran] \n## Top stories\n* [Live.\nIran and Israel launch more attacks as Trump weighs US involvement\n] \n* 35554 viewing36k viewing\n* [\nIran’s secretive nuclear site that only a US bomb could hit\n] \n* [\nBritish woman dies from rabies after puppy scratch\n] \n* Published\n6 hours ago\n## More to explore\n* [\nAfter a night of terror in Kyiv, the search for dead goes on\n] \n![Man in Kyiv] \n* [\nIsrael-Iran: How did latest conflict start and where could it lead?\n] \n![A burned hole in an apartment building as emergency workers stand on the ground below] \n* [\nTwo huge issues - and MPs are making up their own minds\n] \n![The chamber of the House of Commons in Westminster, London, crowded with Members of Parliament seated and standing around a central aisle.

Trump via Truth Social\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel — The United States and Israel have launched strikes against Iran with the goal of toppling the regime, President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Saturday.\n\nIn an [eight-minute video] posted on Truth Social, Trump said the operation, known as \"Epic Fury,\" was \"to prevent this very wicked, radical dictatorship from threatening America and our core national security interests.\"\n\n---\n\nTo jump to specific areas of our coverage, use the links below:\n\n[Casualties] | [Regional Impact] | [How We Got Here] \n\n---\n\n## What we know about casualties on the ground\n\nA person briefed on the operation told NPR that Israel was targeting Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, though their whereabouts weren't immediately clear.\n\nIran's news agency IRNA said U.S.-Israeli strikes hit a girls' school, killing dozens of young students and wounding more.\n\nIran's Foreign Ministry called the airstrikes a \"gross violation\" of its national sovereignty, and retaliated by launching missiles at Israel and at military bases with U.S. troops in Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. An Iranian official said all Israeli and U.S. interests in the region were now considered legitimate targets.\n\nThe UAE Defense Ministry said an Asian migrant worker was killed from fallen debris when air defenses intercepted missiles attacking a base with U.S. troops in Abu Dhabi.\n\n---\n\n## How we got here\n\nThe joint U.S.-Israeli attack on Iran comes after weeks of escalating tensions and a major U.S. military buildup in the region, as the U.S. and Iran tried to negotiate a deal to limit Iran's nuclear program. Trump said those efforts had failed.\n\n\"Bombs will be dropping everywhere,\" President Trump said in his video address. \"When we are finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take. This will be, probably, your only chance for generations.\"\n\nThe Israeli military said in a statement its fighter jets were striking \"dozens of military targets\" in Iran with \"full synchronization and coordination\" between the Israeli and U.S. militaries following months of joint planning.\n\nPrime Minister Netanyahu said the goal of the joint U.S.-Israeli attack is to \"remove the existential threat posed by the terrorist regime in Iran.\"\n\n\"Our joint action will create the conditions for the brave Iranian people to take their destiny into their own hands,\" Netanyahu said in a video.\n\nA person briefed on the operation told NPR it was expected to last a few days, with Israel's military focusing on targeting Iran's missile program.\n\n\"We are going to destroy their missiles and raze their missile industry to the ground,\" Trump said.\n\n---\n\n## Ramifications across the Middle East\n\nIsrael has closed its airspace to all passenger flights, and civil defense protocols have been activated. Regional military forces remain on high alert.\n\nIsrael declared a 48-hour state of emergency. Air raid sirens have been sounding across the country, with authorities warning civilians to enter bomb shelters.\n\nTrails of smoke streaked the sky above Tel Aviv as Israeli interception systems fired at incoming missiles. A hospital in central Israel began moving operations to an underground fortified compound.\n\n\"Our objective is to defend the American people by eliminating imminent threats from the Iranian regime, a vicious group of very hard, terrible people. It's menacing activities directly endanger the United States, our troops, our bases overseas and our allies throughout the world,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump acknowledged that the operation could result in casualties of U.S. troops, but said \"we're doing this for the future, and it is a noble mission.\"\n\n\"We pray for every service member as they selflessly risk their lives to ensure that Americans and our children will never be threatened by a nuclear armed Iran,\" Trump said.\n\nHe said the U.S. had \"sought repeatedly to make a deal\" but Iran \"rejected every opportunity to renounce their nuclear ambitions.\"\n\nTrump told the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps to \"lay down your arms… or you will face certain death.\"\n\nIranian government media reported rocket fire in parts of the capital, Tehran. State television has broadcast footage showing smoke rising after a blast in the city. The extent of the damage and potential casualties has not yet been confirmed.\n\nThe strike follows weeks of speculation about potential military action against Iran, particularly amid a significant U.S. military buildup in the Middle East.\n\n---\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated.\n\n---\n\nRebecca Rosman reported from Paris.

It must stop. The Iranian regime must understand that it now has no other option but to engage in good-faith negotiations to end its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, as well as its actions to destabilise the region,&quot; Macron said on X.\n## UN HUMAN RIGHTS CHIEF VOLKER TURK\n&quot;I deplore the military strikes across Iran this morning by Israel and the United States of America, and the subsequent retaliatory strikes by Iran. As always, in any armed conflict, it is civilians who end up paying the ultimate price.\n&quot;Bombs and missiles are not the way to resolve differences but only result in death, destruction and human misery.\n&quot;To avert these terrible consequences for civilians, I call for restraint and implore all parties to see reason, to de-escalate, and for a return to the ‘negotiating table’ where they had been actively seeking a solution only hours earlier.\n&quot;I have already warned that failing to do so risks an even wider conflict, that will inevitably lead to further senseless civilian deaths and destruction on a potentially unimaginable scale, not just in Iran but across the Middle East region.&quot;\n## CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER MARK CARNEY\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said that Canada supports the U.S. &quot;acting to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and to prevent its regime from further threatening international peace and security&quot;.\n## SPANISH PRIME MINISTER PEDRO SANCHEZ\n&quot;We demand immediate de-escalation and full respect for international law,&quot; Sanchez said in a statement posted on social media platform X.\nSpanish Foreign Minister Albares later said on X that Madrid demanded respect for international law, de-escalation and dialogue, showing support and solidarity with those who are receiving the strikes.\n&quot;The attacks must stop,&quot; he added.\n## OMAN\nOman&#x27;s Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi said that active and serious negotiations mediated by his country between Iran and the U.S. were &quot;yet again undermined&quot;.\n&quot;Neither the interests of the United States nor the cause of global peace are well served by this...I urge the United States not to get sucked in further. This is not your war,&quot; he said on X.\n## LEBANESE PRIME MINISTER NAWAF SALAM\n&quot;I reiterate that we will not accept anyone dragging the country into adventures that threaten its security and unity.&quot;\n## NORWEGIAN FOREIGN MINISTER ESPEN BARTH EIDE\n&quot;The attack is described by Israel as a preventive strike, but it is not in line with international law. Preventive attacks require an immediately imminent threat.&quot;\n## UKRAINE&#x27;S FOREIGN MINISTRY\n&quot;The cause of the current events is precisely the violence and impunity of the Iranian regime, in particular the killings and repression of peaceful protesters, which have become particularly widespread in recent months,&quot; the foreign ministry said.\n## DMITRY MEDVEDEV, DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF RUSSIA&#x27;S SECURITY COUNCIL\n&quot;The peacemaker once again showed his face,&quot; Medvedev, a former Russian president, said. &quot;All negotiations with Iran are a cover operation.

A source with knowledge of the matter had earlier told Reuters that Khamenei was not in Tehran and had been transferred to a secure location.\n\nAn Iranian source close to the establishment said several senior commanders in Iran's Revolutionary Guards and political officials had been killed. Forty people were killed in an Israeli airstrike on a school, state media said. Reuters could not independently confirm the reports.\n\n## TRUMP SAYS 'BOMBS WILL BE DROPPING EVERYWHERE'\n\nIn a video message published on social media, Trump cited Washington's decades-old dispute with Iran, including the seizure of the 1979 U.S. embassy in Tehran, when students held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days, as well as a range of other attacks the U.S. has blamed on Iran since the 1979 Islamic revolution brought the clerics to power.\n\nTrump, who had deployed vast U.S. military firepower in the region saying he hoped to force Iranian concessions in nuclear talks, said the \"massive\" operation was intended to ensure Tehran does not obtain a nuclear weapon and was aimed at \"eliminating imminent threats from the Iranian regime\".\n\nHe urged Iranians to stay sheltered because \"bombs will be dropping everywhere\". But he added: \"When we are finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take. This will be probably your only chance for generations.\"\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the joint U.S.-Israeli attack \"will create the conditions for the brave Iranian people to take their destiny into their own hands\" and \"remove the yoke of tyranny\". Defence Minister Israel Katz called it a pre-emptive strike to remove threats to Israel.\n\nIran's clerical leaders were already in a difficult position after mass anti-government demonstrations in January, which led to a crackdown in which thousands of people were killed, the worst domestic unrest since the era of the 1979 revolution.\n\nProtesters had again taken to the streets in recent days in remembrance of those killed the previous month.\n\nIsraeli military operations have killed some of Iran's senior military officials and severely weakened several of Tehran's once-feared proxy forces across the Middle East.\n\nItem 1 of 11 Smoke rises in the sky after blasts were heard in Manama, Bahrain, February 28.

REUTERS/Stringer [Purchase Licensing Rights, opens new tab] \n\nAfter Israel pounded Iran in a 12-day air war last June joined by the United States, the U.S. and Israel had warned that they would strike again if Iran pressed ahead with its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes. The threats were backed up in recent weeks by a U.S. military buildup in the region.\n\nAn Israeli defence official said the operation had been planned for months in coordination with Washington, and that the launch date was decided weeks ago.\n\nIsrael's military said its Air Force had identified Iranian operatives in western Iran loading a missile unit and preparing to launch an attack. The Air Force struck the operatives and the launcher, preventing the attack, it said.\n\nU.S. air defences intercepted and shot down a drone over a U.S. military base near Erbil in Iraq.\n\n## MISSILES FIRED AT ARAB GULF STATES\n\nThe renewed confrontation dimmed hopes of a diplomatic solution to Tehran's nuclear dispute with the West. Oil markets have been closely watching the standoff between Washington and Tehran to try and determine if supplies will be impacted.\n\n\"If we don’t see signs of de-escalation over the weekend, risk premiums could still drive Brent up\" by $10–$20 per barrel when markets reopen on Monday, said Jorge Leon, head of geopolitical analysis at Rystad Energy.\n\nIran, the third largest producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, pumps about 4.5% of global oil supplies, and a far larger share is shipped past its coast through the strait leading out of the Gulf.\n\nIran's Revolutionary Guards said all [U.S. bases] and interests in the region were within Iran's reach and that Iran's retaliation would continue until \"the enemy is decisively defeated\".

Trump calls for regime overthrow\n\nNPR | By Daniel Estrin,\n\nRebecca Rosman\n\nPublished February 27, 2026 at 11:16 PM PST\n\n- [Email] \n- [LinkedIn] \n- [Bluesky] \n- [Twitter] \n- [Facebook] \n\nListen • 4:32\n\nUpdated February 28, 2026 at 6:34 AM PST\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel — The United States and Israel have launched strikes against Iran with the goal of toppling the regime, President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Saturday.\n\nIn an [eight-minute video] posted on Truth Social, Trump said the operation, known as \"Epic Fury,\" was \"to prevent this very wicked, radical dictatorship from threatening America and our core national security interests.\"\n\n---\n\nTo jump to specific areas of our coverage, use the links below:\n\n[Casualties] | [Regional Impact] | [How We Got Here] \n\n---\n\n## What we know about casualties on the ground\n\nA person briefed on the operation told NPR that Israel was targeting Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, though their whereabouts weren't immediately clear.\n\nIran's news agency IRNA said U.S.-Israeli strikes hit a girls' school, killing dozens of young students and wounding more.\n\nIran's Foreign Ministry called the airstrikes a \"gross violation\" of its national sovereignty, and retaliated by launching missiles at Israel and at military bases with U.S. troops in Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. An Iranian official said all Israeli and U.S. interests in the region were now considered legitimate targets.\n\nThe UAE Defense Ministry said an Asian migrant worker was killed from fallen debris when air defenses intercepted missiles attacking a base with U.S. troops in Abu Dhabi.\n\n---\n\n## How we got here\n\nThe joint U.S.-Israeli attack on Iran comes after weeks of escalating tensions and a major U.S. military buildup in the region, as the U.S. and Iran tried to negotiate a deal to limit Iran's nuclear program. Trump said those efforts had failed.\n\n\"Bombs will be dropping everywhere,\" President Trump said in his video address. \"When we are finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take. This will be, probably, your only chance for generations.\"\n\nThe Israeli military said in a statement its fighter jets were striking \"dozens of military targets\" in Iran with \"full synchronization and coordination\" between the Israeli and U.S. militaries following months of joint planning.\n\nPrime Minister Netanyahu said the goal of the joint U.S.-Israeli attack is to \"remove the existential threat posed by the terrorist regime in Iran.\"\n\n\"Our joint action will create the conditions for the brave Iranian people to take their destiny into their own hands,\" Netanyahu said in a video.\n\nA person briefed on the operation told NPR it was expected to last a few days, with Israel's military focusing on targeting Iran's missile program.\n\n\"We are going to destroy their missiles and raze their missile industry to the ground,\" Trump said.\n\n---\n\n## Ramifications across the Middle East\n\nIsrael has closed its airspace to all passenger flights, and civil defense protocols have been activated. Regional military forces remain on high alert.\n\nIsrael declared a 48-hour state of emergency. Air raid sirens have been sounding across the country, with authorities warning civilians to enter bomb shelters.\n\nTrails of smoke streaked the sky above Tel Aviv as Israeli interception systems fired at incoming missiles. A hospital in central Israel began moving operations to an underground fortified compound.\n\n\"Our objective is to defend the American people by eliminating imminent threats from the Iranian regime, a vicious group of very hard, terrible people. It's menacing activities directly endanger the United States, our troops, our bases overseas and our allies throughout the world,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump acknowledged that the operation could result in casualties of U.S. troops, but said \"we're doing this for the future, and it is a noble mission.\"\n\n\"We pray for every service member as they selflessly risk their lives to ensure that Americans and our children will never be threatened by a nuclear armed Iran,\" Trump said.\n\nHe said the U.S. had \"sought repeatedly to make a deal\" but Iran \"rejected every opportunity to renounce their nuclear ambitions.\"\n\nTrump told the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps to \"lay down your arms… or you will face certain death.\"\n\nIranian government media reported rocket fire in parts of the capital, Tehran. State television has broadcast footage showing smoke rising after a blast in the city. The extent of the damage and potential casualties has not yet been confirmed.\n\nThe strike follows weeks of speculation about potential military action against Iran, particularly amid a significant U.S. military buildup in the Middle East.\n\n---\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated.\n\n---\n\nRebecca Rosman reported from Paris. Aya Batrawy contributed reporting from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.\n\nCopyright 2026 NPR\n\nTags\n\n[NPR] [Middle East & Israel/Gaza News] [World] \n\n- [Email] \n- [LinkedIn] \n- [Bluesky] \n- [Twitter] \n- [Facebook] \n\nDaniel Estrin\n\nDaniel Estrin is NPR's international correspondent in Jerusalem.\n\nRebecca Rosman\n\n[Copyright 2024 NPR]"

\n\nFacebook Tweet [Email] Link Threads\n\nLink Copied!\n\nFollow\n\nThe United States and Israel have launched a major attack on Iran, which President Donald Trump said would lay waste to the country’s military, obliterate its military program, and could even topple its regime.\n\nIn a video on Truth Social, Trump accused Iran of rejecting “every opportunity to renounce their nuclear ambitions,” and said the US “can’t take it anymore.”\n\nUnlike the last time the US and Israel struck Iran, in June, these strikes began in daylight on Saturday morning – the first day of the week in Iran – as millions went to work or school. And whereas the US strikes in June were over within a few hours, sources have told CNN that the US military is this time planning for several days of attacks, suggesting broader objectives.\n\nIn response, the Iranian regime has launched an unprecedented wave of strikes across the Middle East, targeting several countries that host US military bases. Blasts have been heard from the beaches of Dubai to the streets of Doha, in what could be the opening salvos of a war that threatens to engulf the region.\n\nThe extent of the damage in Iran and across the region is still emerging. Here’s what we know so far.\n\n## How did we get here?\n\nThe Iranian government has been under severe pressure since the turn of the year. Already weakened by last summer’s war with Israel, which the US briefly joined, the regime has been battling a severe economic crisis which sparked nationwide protests in January.\n\nAfter a crackdown left thousands of protesters dead, Trump promised to come to their aid. He warned the US was “locked and loaded” to attack and began moving huge amounts of materiel to the region.\n\nDespite the military building, the US also resumed efforts to reach a new nuclear deal with Iran. The last round of talks ended in Switzerland on Thursday, with Iran agreeing “never” to stockpile enriched uranium. The Omani foreign minister, who has acted as a mediator in the talks, said there had been “significant” progress.\n\nPeople run for cover following an explosion in Tehran, on Saturday, February 28.\n\nMajid Asgaripour/West Asia News Agency/Reuters\n\n## Why did the US strike Iran?\n\nThat progress, however, was not enough to prevent the US from taking military action. In his 2.30 a.m. address, Trump said the main objective of the operation – which the Department of Defense is calling “Operation Epic Fury” – is “to defend the American people by eliminating imminent threats from the Iranian regime.”\n\nThose threats, he said, included Iran’s nuclear program – which the White House claimed to have “totally” obliterated with its strikes in June.\n\n“It has always been the policy of the United States, in particular my administration, that this terrorist regime can never have a nuclear weapon,” Trump said, without providing evidence that Iran was any closer to obtaining a nuclear weapon. “They rejected every opportunity to renounce their nuclear ambitions, and we can’t take it anymore.”\n\nThe president also repeated his recent claims that Iran is building ballistic missiles which could reach the US mainland. In his State of the Union address Tuesday, Trump said Iran has “already developed missiles that can threaten Europe and our bases overseas, and they’re working to build missiles that will soon reach the United States of America.”\n\nBut these claims are not backed up by US intelligence, CNN has previously reported. An [unclassified assessment] from the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) from 2025 said that Iran could develop a “militarily-viable” intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) by 2035 “should Tehran decide to pursue the capability.”\n\nAccording to two sources, the claim that Iran will soon have a missile capable of hitting the US is not backed up by intelligence. There is no intelligence to suggest that Iran is pursuing an ICBM program to hit the US at this time, the sources said.\n\n## Why is Israel striking Iran?\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long viewed Iran as Israel’s most dangerous adversary. After crippling Iran’s proxies – Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon – Israel last summer launched a war against Iran itself.\n\nAlthough Israel halted the conflict after the US struck Iran’s nuclear sites, analysts had long suspected that Netanyahu would take an opportunity to resume attacks on Iran. With elections due in October, Netanyahu may also see the return to war as a chance to shore up his standing domestically.\n\nIn a video statement Saturday, explaining why Israel was resuming its strikes on Iran, Netanyahu also repeated his claim that the Islamic regime must not be allowed to acquire a nuclear weapon.\n\n## Are the US and Israel seeking regime change?\n\nWhat was unusual about Trump’s and Netanyahu’s statements is that both were explicit about their hopes for regime change in Iran.\n\nTrump addressed the Iranian people directly, telling them that “the hour of your freedom is at hand.”\n\n“When we are finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take. This will be, probably, your only chance for generations,” he said.\n\nNetanyahu also called on “all parts of the Iranian people” to “cast off the yoke of tyranny and bring about a free and peaceful Iran.” He said the US and Israeli actions “will create the conditions for the brave Iranian people to take their destiny into their own hands.”\n\nAn Israeli military official has, however, emphasized that the main focus of the operation remains on military targets.\n\n## What has been hit?\n\n[Explosions] were heard in [Tehran’s] Pasteur district, where the highly secure compound housing the residence and office of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is located, Iranian state-affiliated news outlets said. Several other cities were hit.\n\nTwo Israeli sources told CNN that the strikes targeted senior figures, including Khamenei, President Masoud Pezeshkian, and the armed forces’ chief of staff Abdolrahim Mousavi.\n\nIranian state media said top officials were safe, including Pezeshkian, but the targets suggest that Israel is seeking to decapitate the Iranian leadership.\n\n## How has Iran responded?\n\nIran has retaliated with an unprecedented wave of strikes across the Middle East, targeting several nearby countries that host US military bases, as well as Israel.\n\nWhen the US and Israel last struck Iran in June, they targeted its stockpile of ballistic missiles, hampering its ability to retaliate. Iran could be trying to make use of its arsenal while it still has it.\n\nBlasts have been reported in the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Bahrain as well as in Iran’s key regional rival Saudi Arabia, which vowed to take “all necessary measures” to defend itself.\n\nIran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, condemned the US-Israeli strikes as unprovoked and illegal.\n\nThe Middle East Donald Trump\n\n[See all topics] \n\nFacebook Tweet [Email] Link Threads\n\nLink Copied!\n\nFollow\n\nScan the QR code to download the CNN app on Google Play.\n\nScan the QR code to download the CNN app from the Apple Store."

              "reasoning": "Okay, let me start breaking this down. The user wants me to analyze the four provided summaries from different political disciplines (Left, Center-Left, Center, Right) regarding why the U.S. and Israel are attacking Iran. The goal is to identify convergent concepts, contradictory tensions, and emergent insights from cross-disciplinary integration.\n\nFirst, I'll look for convergent concepts. All disciplines mention preemptive strikes, but let's check which ones. Left (0) mentions \"Preemptive Military Action,\" Center-Left (1) has \"Operation Epic Fury\" as preemptive, Center (2) uses \"Pre-emptive strikes,\" and Right (3) \"Preemptive action.\" So all four mention preemptive aspects. Wait, the user's example shows discipline 0,1,3. Wait, but original summaries: Discipline 0 (Left) mentions \"Preemptive Military Action,\" Discipline 1 (Center-Left) \"Operation Epic Fury\" (which is the preemptive strike), Discipline 2 (Center) \"Pre-emptive strikes,\" and Discipline 3 (Right) \"Preemptive action.\" So actually, all four mention preemptive, but in the example, maybe they grouped them as 0,1,3. Wait, maybe the example grouped differently. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the provided summaries:\n\n- Left (0): \"Preemptive Military Action\" in terms.\n- Center-Left (1): \"Operation Epic Fury\" as the operation name and mentions preemptive.\n- Center (2): \"Pre-emptive strikes.\"\n- Right (3): \"Preemptive action.\"\n\nSo all four disciplines touch on preemptive aspects. But maybe the convergent is across more than two. The user's JSON example shows disciplines [0,1,3], but maybe actually, all four include preemptive elements, but the user might have intended some grouping. Wait, but the instruction says to list concepts that appear in at least two. So perhaps all four, but since convergent entries can be varying groupings, but the user's example uses three. Let me check again.\n\nLooking for convergences:\n\n1. Preemptive action: All disciplines except maybe 0? Wait, Left (0) terms include \"Preemptive Military Action\". Yes. So all four mention preemptive aspects in terms. So this should be a convergent across all four. But the user's example groups three. Wait, maybe the analysis needs to check each term.\n\nAnother convergent could be civilian casualties/humanitarian impact. Left (0) mentions \"Humanitarian Consequences,\" Center-Left (1) \"Humanitarian toll,\" Center (2) \"Civilian casualties,\" Right (3) \"Civilian casualties\". So all four touch on this.\n\nRegime change/focus: Left mentions \"Regime Oppression,\" Center-Left \"regime change agenda,\" Right \"Regime overthrow.\" So disciplines 0,1,3. That's another convergent.\n\nRetaliatory risks: Left (0) \"Retaliatory Risks,\" Center-Left (1) \"Ballistic missile retaliation,\" Center (2) mentions Iran's retaliation, Right (3) \"Retaliatory strikes.\" So disciplines 0,1,2,3. Convergent as well.\n\nRegional impact: Left (0) \"Geopolitical Alignment,\" Center-Left (1) \"Regional Impact,\" Center (2) \"Regional destabilization,\" Right (3) \"Regional destabilization.\" All four mention regional aspects.\n\nNuclear program: All disciplines mention Iran's nuclear program as a reason. Terms like \"Nuclear Proliferation Prevention\" (0), \"Nuclear program stalemate\" (1), \"Nuclear program\" (2), \"Nuclear ambitions\" (3). So convergent point here.\n\nNow, for the convergent section, I need to list concepts that appear in two or more disciplines. Let's pick the key ones:\n\n1. Preemptive military action (disciplines 0,1,2,3)\n2. Civilian casualties/humanitarian impact (0,1,2,3)\n3. Regime change/overthrow agenda (0,1,3)\n4. Retaliatory actions/risks (0,1,2,3)\n5. Regional destabilization (0,2,3)\n6. Nuclear program as justification (0,1,2,3)\n\nBut the user's answer format wants 3-6 convergent entries. Maybe group similar ones.\n\nNow, contradictory tensions. Looking for genuine disagreements between disciplines. Left (0) might critique the justification, while Center (2) accepts framing. For example, the Left (0) claims that Israel's preemptive strikes were based on disputed intelligence (contradicts Center's (2) framing as necessary against imminent threats). Another tension: Left (0) emphasizes disproportionate humanitarian costs, while Right (3) focuses on necessary security actions. Also, Center-Left (1) highlights Trump's regime change agenda as a driver, while Right (3) focuses on national security. Another possible contradiction: Left (0) and Center-Left (1) emphasize failed diplomacy/humanitarian costs, while Center (2) and Right (3) stress preemptive necessity.\n\nEmergent insights would be things visible only when combining disciplines. For example, the synthesis of all perspectives might show that regime change is both a stated goal (Right) and a risk for escalation (Left), leading to a multi-layered conflict. Or that the humanitarian impact is a common thread despite differing political stances. Another possibility: the collective emphasis on regional retaliation indicates a cycle of violence that's not evident in single disciplines.\n\nPutting it all together in JSON format as per instructions.\n",

Wait, but original summaries: Discipline 0 (Left) mentions \"Preemptive Military Action,\" Discipline 1 (Center-Left) \"Operation Epic Fury\" (which is the preemptive strike), Discipline 2 (Center) \"Pre-emptive strikes,\" and Discipline 3 (Right) \"Preemptive action.\" So actually, all four mention preemptive, but in the example, maybe they grouped them as 0,1,3. Wait, maybe the example grouped differently. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the provided summaries:\n\n- Left (0): \"Preemptive Military Action\" in terms.\n- Center-Left (1): \"Operation Epic Fury\" as the operation name and mentions preemptive.\n- Center (2): \"Pre-emptive strikes.\"\n- Right (3): \"Preemptive action.\"\n\nSo all four disciplines touch on preemptive aspects. But maybe the convergent is across more than two. The user's JSON example shows disciplines [0,1,3], but maybe actually, all four include preemptive elements, but the user might have intended some grouping. Wait, but the instruction says to list concepts that appear in at least two. So perhaps all four, but since convergent entries can be varying groupings, but the user's example uses three. Let me check again.\n\nLooking for convergences:\n\n1. Preemptive action: All disciplines except maybe 0? Wait, Left (0) terms include \"Preemptive Military Action\". Yes. So all four mention preemptive aspects in terms. So this should be a convergent across all four. But the user's example groups three. Wait, maybe the analysis needs to check each term.\n\nAnother convergent could be civilian casualties/humanitarian impact. Left (0) mentions \"Humanitarian Consequences,\" Center-Left (1) \"Humanitarian toll,\" Center (2) \"Civilian casualties,\" Right (3) \"Civilian casualties\". So all four touch on this.\n\nRegime change/focus: Left mentions \"Regime Oppression,\" Center-Left \"regime change agenda,\" Right \"Regime overthrow.\" So disciplines 0,1,3. That's another convergent.\n\nRetaliatory risks: Left (0) \"Retaliatory Risks,\" Center-Left (1) \"Ballistic missile retaliation,\" Center (2) mentions Iran's retaliation, Right (3) \"Retaliatory strikes.\" So disciplines 0,1,2,3. Convergent as well.\n\nRegional impact: Left (0) \"Geopolitical Alignment,\" Center-Left (1) \"Regional Impact,\" Center (2) \"Regional destabilization,\" Right (3) \"Regional destabilization.\" All four mention regional aspects.\n\nNuclear program: All disciplines mention Iran's nuclear program as a reason. Terms like \"Nuclear Proliferation Prevention\" (0), \"Nuclear program stalemate\" (1), \"Nuclear program\" (2), \"Nuclear ambitions\" (3). So convergent point here.\n\nNow, for the convergent section, I need to list concepts that appear in two or more disciplines. Let's pick the key ones:\n\n1. Preemptive military action (disciplines 0,1,2,3)\n2. Civilian casualties/humanitarian impact (0,1,2,3)\n3. Regime change/overthrow agenda (0,1,3)\n4. Retaliatory actions/risks (0,1,2,3)\n5. Regional destabilization (0,2,3)\n6. Nuclear program as justification (0,1,2,3)\n\nBut the user's answer format wants 3-6 convergent entries. Maybe group similar ones.\n\nNow, contradictory tensions. Looking for genuine disagreements between disciplines. Left (0) might critique the justification, while Center (2) accepts framing. For example, the Left (0) claims that Israel's preemptive strikes were based on disputed intelligence (contradicts Center's (2) framing as necessary against imminent threats). Another tension: Left (0) emphasizes disproportionate humanitarian costs, while Right (3) focuses on necessary security actions. Also, Center-Left (1) highlights Trump's regime change agenda as a driver, while Right (3) focuses on national security. Another possible contradiction: Left (0) and Center-Left (1) emphasize failed diplomacy/humanitarian costs, while Center (2) and Right (3) stress preemptive necessity.\n\nEmergent insights would be things visible only when combining disciplines. For example, the synthesis of all perspectives might show that regime change is both a stated goal (Right) and a risk for escalation (Left), leading to a multi-layered conflict. Or that the humanitarian impact is a common thread despite differing political stances. Another possibility: the collective emphasis on regional retaliation indicates a cycle of violence that's not evident in single disciplines.\n\nPutting it all together in JSON format as per instructions.\n"

What changed when he decided to bomb Iran?\n\n## Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long lobbied American presidents to help Israel bomb Iran. None have taken him up on it. Until now.\n\n[Kim Hjelmgaard] \n\nUSA TODAY\n\nJune 22, 2025Updated June 23, 2025, 12:25 p.m. ET\n\nPresident Donald Trump campaigned on stopping \"endless wars.\" He also entered office vowing to bring a swift closure to conflicts in [Gaza] and [Ukraine]. Five months in, he has joined [Israel's war on Iran's nuclear facilities].\n\nSo what has changed? And what were the warning signs Trump was prepared to become the third wheel in an Israel-Iran contest for regional dominance that has been playing out for decades?\n\nThe extent of damage done in Iran was not clear. The White House says U.S. bombers decimated three uranium enrichment facilities. What comes next is also far from certain: additional U.S. strikes, Iran's retaliation, a resumption of diplomacy? Is this the start of the collapse of Iran's clerical regime? Is it a historic moment akin to the breakup of the Soviet Union?\n\nWhat's indisputable is that one pull factor for the United States is Israeli Prime Minister [Benjamin Netanyahu] 's long, complicated relationship with recent American presidents. The U.S. bombing of Iran is also the culmination of a debate that traces at least as far back to the 1990s when Netanyahu, then a young lawmaker, predicted the Islamic Republic, Israel's sworn enemy, would one day either acquire, or be on the cusp of acquiring, a nuclear weapon and Israel would be forced to act − ideally with U.S. help.\n\n\"Within three to five years, we can assume that Iran will become autonomous in its ability to develop and produce a nuclear bomb,\" Netanyahu said in 1992. His prediction was later repeated in his 1995 book, \"Fighting Terrorism.\"\n\n## Netanyahu's constant refrain: Bomb Iran\n\nNetanyahu is the longest-serving Israeli prime minister in the Jewish state's history. He has occupied the role on and off for more than 17 years. In every one of those years he has sought to persuade American presidents to attack Iran's nuclear program, which Tehran insists is for civilian energy purposes only.\n\nNetanyahu has appeared at the United Nations with elaborate maps and cartoon-style drawings of bombs. He worked hard to scupper the 2015 nuclear accord between Iran and world powers that Trump exited because he said Iranian officials could not be trusted.\n\nIn 2002, Netanyahu told a U.S. congressional committee that both Iraq and Iran would soon have a nuclear bomb. A year later the United States invaded Iraq. In 2009, he told members of Congress in private that Iran was just a year or two away from producing a nuclear weapon, according to a U.S. State Department [cable released by WikiLeaks].\n\nSuccessive American presidents have listened and acted on Netanyahu's Iran warnings, most substantively politically in the form of the Obama administration's 2015 nuclear deal, which was designed to limit Iran's uranium enrichment in return for relief of U.S. economic sanctions on Tehran. When Trump, in his first term, exited that agreement, it was working in the sense that Iran was not enriching uranium at a level necessary to produce a nuclear weapon, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the United Nations' nuclear watchdog.\n\nNetanyahu's public and private relationships with American presidents have been marked by chilly tensions and insults. In 2015, Netanyahu's spokesman apologized to former [President Barack Obama]. He has also clashed with former presidents Bill Clinton and Joe Biden. Netanyahu has even annoyed Trump, although their relationship trends [toward mutual lavish praise].\n\nBut no American president − until now − has gone along with Netanyahu's war plans for Iran, fearing the United States could be dragged into a wider Middle East war. The experiences of Iraq and Afghanistan still haunt U.S. presidents.\n\n\"The president more than anybody is worried about protracted military conflicts, and that is not what we are getting ourselves involved in,” Vice President [JD Vance] said on ABC's \"This Week\" program June 22.\n\nVance said the Trump administration also is not trying to force regime change in Iran.\n\n## Reading Trump's Iran tea leaves\n\nTrump may also not be as risk-averse to military action as he is sometimes portrayed, including by himself.\n\nIn his first term, he ordered a missile attack in Syria to punish then-Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for using chemical weapons; a raid to kill Islamic State group leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi; and a drone attack that killed Qasem Soleimani, a senior Iranian military commander much beloved in Iran whose death led to Iranian reprisals on U.S. bases in Iraq.\n\nAlso in the background: The IAEA and former U.S. officials such as Dan Shapiro, U.S. ambassador to Israel during the Obama administration, say Iran's nuclear capabilities had advanced since Trump exited the nuclear deal. \"Iran cannot be left with an enrichment capability, able to produce a nuclear weapon at a time of its choosing,\" [Shapiro wrote] in a recent blog post.\n\nTrump has made comments for years that reflect that sentiment.\n\nThe main thrust of his remarks in recent weeks have been to say he won't allow Iran to continue its nuclear enrichment program, and Tehran could give it up through negotiation or through what he called \"the hard way.\"\n\nAfter first pushing for a diplomatic solution, Trump's tone changed after Israel struck dozens of [Iranian nuclear and military targets] on June 13, killing many of Iran's military elite and senior nuclear scientists. By June 17, the president was threatening Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, on social media, [calling him an \"easy target.\"] \n\nTrump likes a winner. He often says so himself.\n\nIn the days leading up to the U.S. strike, Israel appeared to be winning.\n\n\"Congratulations, President Trump, your bold decision to target Iran’s nuclear facilities with the awesome and righteous might of the United States will change history,” Netanyahu said in a statement as he addressed the world June 22. He spoke in English, not Hebrew.\n\nIn his own address, to the American people, Trump said: \"I want to thank and congratulate Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu. We worked as a team like perhaps no team has ever worked before, and we’ve gone a long way to erasing this horrible threat to Israel.\"\n\nNot mentioned: U.S. intelligence agencies assessed earlier this year that they did not believe Iran was close to building a nuclear bomb.\n\nContributing: Francesca Chambers, Tom Vanden Brook\n\nFeatured Weekly Ad"

I'm Dave Davies. After a year and a half of dramatic and often heartbreaking news from the Middle East, events of the past four days have been truly head-spinning. Over the weekend, President Donald Trump joined Israel's air campaign against Iran, dropping massive bunker-busting bombs and other heavy munitions on three Iranian nuclear sites. Iran responded with what appeared to be a symbolic military gesture, a missile attack on an American base in Qatar, which it warned was coming and caused no injuries. Trump called it very weak and said he does not intend to retaliate.\n\nAs we record today's show Tuesday morning, a ceasefire between Israel and Iran has been marred by alleged violations on both sides, while Trump warns the two adversaries to hold their fire. Our guest today, veteran Iran expert Karim Sadjadpour, has called Trump's bombing of Iran's nuclear facilities a once-in-a-generation event that could transform the Middle East. While the impact of the conflict may not be clear for years, Sadjadpour says, the attacks by the U.S. and Israel do raise a more immediate question - will they strengthen the authoritarian regime in Tehran or hasten its demise?\n\nWe've asked Sadjadpour to join us today to help us understand the nature of the Iranian regime and explore some of the many questions raised by recent events. Karim Sadjadpour is a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a contributing writer for The Atlantic, and an adjunct professor at Georgetown University School of Foreign Service. He was previously an analyst for the International Crisis Group, based in Tehran and Washington. He grew up in the United States but is the son of Iranian parents. We recorded our interview this morning.\n\nWell, Karim Sadjadpour, welcome back to FRESH AIR. It has been a very busy, dizzying series of events. And I wonder if you might begin by just sharing what you may be hearing from friends and contacts in Iran about how they are, how they're reacting to the U.S. entry into the war.\n\nKARIM SADJADPOUR: Well, thank you, Dave. It's wonderful to be with you. I think that inside Iran, you have a very torn population. On one hand, Iranians are very patriotic, very nationalistic people. At the same time, I would say probably more than 80% of Iranians are deeply discontent living under the Islamic Republic, which is essentially not only a politically authoritarian regime, but it's also socially authoritarian, and it's profoundly mismanaged the country economically.\n\nAnd so I think that early on in the war, when Israel first invaded last week and they took out some of Iran's senior military commanders, these were individuals that were associated with repression for many Iranians. And those were very precision operations and didn't impact the lives of most Iranians. So early on, I think many members of Iranian society were watching in amazement that, you know, suddenly these individuals who were the faces of repression in Iran could just be disappeared.\n\nBut then, as the war went to Tehran and it became an urban war, and President Trump and senior Israeli officials called for residents of Tehran - a city of more than 10 million people - to evacuate, that started to cause enormous disruption in Iranian society, and there's been hundreds of civilian casualties now. And so I think it's a population which is, right now, living in a profound state of anxiety. And then, you know, America dropping several 30,000-pound bombs on Iran's nuclear facilities is unprecedented. I think there's a combination of perhaps deep humiliation, perhaps anger on the part of some. And despite the fact that the official slogan of the Iranian regime for many years has been death to America, it's a population which I would argue has yearned for a rapprochement with America. And so very complex feelings there.\n\nDAVIES: Well, you know, one of the things that's just not clear in the events of recent days is what the impact is on Iran's nuclear program. And, you know, President Trump said that it was - that the facilities were obliterated. American military leaders were more measured in their comments. It's just not clear. And I have to say, you know, when I had pictured bunker-busting bombs hitting this mountain where the Fordo nuclear facility was based, I pictured it, you know, being a kind of relatively contained space that a single bomb might not penetrate immediately, but several in a row might get inside the mountain and just blow it up. When you now look at satellite photos, it is a huge area, and, you know, the holes left by these missiles are relatively small. So it's just not exactly clear - is it? - how much damage they've done. What's your sense?\n\nSADJADPOUR: Well, to the extent that Iran had industrial-sized nuclear program, that industrial-sized nuclear program has been significantly degraded. The question here is, has Iran's ability to build a nuclear weapon been significantly degraded? And the concern that many people have is that the stockpile of highly enriched uranium which Iran had accumulated over the years was removed from those nuclear sites before the bombing happened. This is according to Vice President Vance, who said that we're not sure where that highly enriched uranium is. You know, from talking to my colleagues who are nuclear physicists, they say, you know, these are like scuba tanks, scuba-diving oxygen tanks. It's around 400 kilograms worth, but they can fit in perhaps a dozen trucks.\n\nAnd Iran, we know, has the technical wherewithal to build a nuclear weapon if they choose to do so. It's long been no longer a technical question in Iran, but a political question of whether they wanted to cross that threshold. So on one hand, we did significantly degrade Iran's industrial-sized nuclear facilities. There is a concern now that if it's a regime which is hell-bent on acquiring a nuclear weapon, they still probably have the scientists, the technical capabilities. They have the stockpiles of highly enriched uranium, and they may be able to set up centrifuge cascades, you know, in a basement somewhere in the country. Iran is an enormous country.\n\nNow, if a Mossad agent were on this interview with us, they would say, listen, we have thoroughly penetrated this Iranian system. As everyone witnessed in the last week, you know, you had senior Iranian military commanders who were assassinated in their bedrooms. So the idea that we don't know where 400 kilograms of uranium is - highly enriched uranium is is incorrect. But again, this is the concern that Vice President Vance raised - that that highly enriched uranium is unaccounted for. So, you know, as I wrote, Dave, in the early hours after this operation, we will only know with the benefit of hindsight, several years from now, whether this military operation prevented Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon or it actually ensured that Iran would acquire a nuclear weapon.\n\nDAVIES: So let's talk about the Iranian regime. This is a country with an elected parliament - 290 members - and an elected president. But someone else with the title of supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, is he, in effect, a dictator with the authority of, say, you know, Muammar Gaddafi in his day?\n\nSADJADPOUR: Perhaps not in the same level as Muammar Gaddafi, but, absolutely, Ayatollah Khamenei is a dictator. He's arguably the longest-serving autocrat in the world. He became supreme leader in 1989 after the founder of the Islamic Revolution, Ayatollah Khomeini, passed away. One thing he's done very cleverly - I wrote a piece many years ago entitled \"Ayatollah Machiavelli\" because he's a very clever political operator in that, in contrast to a lot of autocrats in the Middle East - whether you mentioned Muammar Gaddafi or Saddam Hussein or, you know, modern-day autocrats - the key to Khamenei's longevity is that he has, for many years, wielded power without accountability. And that's because of these institutions in Iran that have accountability without power.\n\nSo the way that other autocrats absorb the blame for what's happening in their nations - whether that's, you know, economic malaise or political repression, social repression - for many years, Khamenei has been able to deflect that onto elected institutions like, as I said, the president of Iran or the Parliament, or the Guardian Council or elsewhere. But that is much more difficult for him to do now. He's seen by most Iranians now as an autocrat. For the majority of Iranians now, the only leader they've known is Ayatollah Khamenei because he's been ruling for 36 years, and the median age of Iranians is lower than 36 years.\n\nDAVIES: Right. Do we know the state of his health, his cognitive abilities or even his whereabouts? He's said to be in hiding.\n\nSADJADPOUR: So it's long been thought that he has prostate cancer and he's been managing that prostate cancer for many years. You know, I tend to watch his speeches rather than read them, just so you get a sense of how he appears, the strength of his voice. And he's 86 years old. So, you know, obviously, he doesn't have the physical and the mental bandwidth to be micromanaging the country as he used to. And, you know, I think a lot about his current predicament because, as you said, he's living right now in a bunker. You know, the president of the United States, President Trump, essentially threatened to take him out.\n\nDAVIES: Right.\n\nSADJADPOUR: And so he's been living in fear and hiding. As I said, several of his - at least a dozen of his top military commanders were assassinated in the last week - people whom he has grown to really rely on. So he has to be operating in a state of paranoia about how penetrated his system is. And, you know, he's fighting three wars - three very high-tech wars against the greatest superpower in the world, the United States, the greatest military power in the Middle East, which is the state of Israel, and his own population. And that's daunting for any individual, let alone an 86-year-old man inside a bunker whose only formal education was in the seminaries of Qom six decades ago.\n\nDAVIES: We need to take a break here. Let me reintroduce you. We are speaking with Karim Sadjadpour, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, formerly an analyst with the International Crisis Group, based in Tehran and Washington. We recorded our interview this morning. We'll hear more after this short break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF JULIAN LAGE GROUP'S \"IOWA TAKEN\")\n\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And we're speaking with Karim Sadjadpour, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and formerly an analyst with the International Crisis Group, based in Tehran and Washington. We're talking about the events in the Middle East. We recorded our interview this morning.\n\nYou know, I've heard you make the point that when you look at countries that have long-running hostilities, like, you know, China and Taiwan, India and Pakistan, they're often countries that share borders or at least, you know, compete for a defined sphere of influence. And when you look at Israel and Iran, that really is not true, is it?\n\nSADJADPOUR: It's not. And this is, you know, one of the great tragedies of this modern conflict - that, in my view, these two countries, Israel and Iran, are more natural partners or allies than they are adversaries. You know, first of all, there's a great historic affinity between the two peoples - Persians and Jews. You know, the ancient Persian King Cyrus the Great was revered in the Old Testament. You know, Iran has one of the oldest continuously inhabited Jewish communities in the world. Now, that community has significantly dwindled since the Islamic Revolution of 1979. And, you know, what essentially happened in 1979 was, virtually overnight, Iran went from being a U.S.-allied monarchy led by the shah of Iran to...\n\nDAVIES: And an ally of Israel, right?\n\nSADJADPOUR: And an ally - a close partner of Israel. And virtually overnight, it went to being an Islamist theocracy led by the Ayatollah Khamenei. And I would say that there was kind of three pillars of the Islamic Revolution that we continue to see to this day. And they are death to America, death to Israel and the mandatory hijab - the mandatory veiling of women, which Ayatollah Khomeini called the flag of the Islamic Revolution.\n\nBut, you know, even now, when you look at modern times, Iran and Israel, this is not a geopolitical war as much as it is an ideological war, right? Iran is an energy superpower. Israel is a technology superpower. There's compatible interests there. But for decades now, being hostile to Israel has really been part of the identity of the Iranian system.\n\nAnd there is a strategic element to it as well, in that if you're a country like Iran, which is predominantly Persian, predominantly Shiite Muslim, in a Middle East which is predominantly Sunni Arab, and you want to be a regional hegemon, you're not going to win a lot of supporters by waving the Persian flag or the Shiite flag. But if you wave the Palestine flag and the anti-Israel flag, that helps to transcend the Persian-Arab divide and the Sunni-Shia divide. So there is a strategic element to it as well. But in my view, it is an unnatural hostility. And the day in which Iran has a government that prioritizes the national interests before revolutionary ideology, I think the Iran-Israel hostility - the Islamic Republic's hostility toward Israel will cease.\n\nDAVIES: Yeah, it is interesting because, you know, historically, I mean, there are, you know, Muslim communities and rulers that had good relations with Jewish populations. I mean, it wasn't necessarily inevitable that Iran would see Israel as a bitter enemy. But this was essentially a matter of revolutionary dogma?\n\nSADJADPOUR: Yeah, when you look back at the writings of Ayatollah Khomeini, it was clear antisemitism. It wasn't -- you know, he wasn't just attacking Zionism or Israel. He would mention the word Jews and talk about Jewish betrayals of the prophet Muhammad. You know, now, the Islamic Republic has -- has kind of learned to sugarcoat their language somewhat. They don't say Jews. They say Zionists. They try to focus on the state of Israel.\n\nBut Iranians are still kind of living in the ideological experiment of Ayatollah Khomeini - a treatise he wrote in 1970 called \"Islamic Government.\" And you go back and read those writings - he was far more obsessed with destroying Israel than he has been building Iran. And, you know, that's also what I say about the Islamic Republic. You can very frequently hear official slogans of death to America, death to Israel. I don't recall ever the supreme leader saying, long live Iran or that being, you know, a public slogan in their official gatherings.\n\nDAVIES: You know, you've written that Iran has a relatively well-educated and certainly globally connected population. A lot of people have traveled. If we polled ordinary Iranian citizens, how - to what extent would they share the supreme leader's hatred of Israel and the United States?\n\nSADJADPOUR: You know, nowadays, especially young populations are all consuming the same culture, right? - online, on social media, on Instagram. And that's not to say that Iranians are not very proud of their identity. It's a very proud, nationalistic population. But I think people have figured out that the country will never fulfill its enormous potential.\n\nAnd I really believe Iran has the human capital and the natural resources to be a G20 nation. It should be one of - easily one of the top 20 economies in the world. But that can only happen, as I said, if the organizing principle of Iran's leadership is nationalism and long live Iran - not death to America and death to Israel. The country will never fulfill its enormous potential as long as it's focused more on destroying others than uplifting itself. And I think most Iranians get that.\n\nYou know, many of these days, they've seen the example - the remarkable example of Dubai, which, four decades ago, was a backwater. And essentially, you know, what one Iranian friend once told me was, you know, 46 years ago, Dubai and Iran went to the same elevator - or I should say the United Arab Emirates - went to the same elevator. And the UAE pushed up, and Iran pushed down. And, you know, the gap between them has been enormous. So, you know, I think that, you know, it's a population which - as I say, it's a regime which aspires to be like North Korea, a society which aspires to be more like South Korea.\n\nDAVIES: You know, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is 86. Do we know if he has planned succession?\n\nSADJADPOUR: So some reporting has come out recently about his plans for succession, although we don't know how accurate it is. There's only been one succession event in the history - the 46-year history of the Islamic Republic, when Ayatollah Khomeini died in 1989 and Khamenei replaced him. There's a body called the Assembly of Experts, and it's around 86 clerics. I joke that their average age is deceased.\n\nDAVIES: (Laughter).\n\nSADJADPOUR: You know, these are clerics that are - you know, make Khamenei look young in comparison. The head of it is a 98-year-old guy, Ayatollah Jannati. So in theory, that body, the Assembly of Experts, will decide who is Khamenei's successor. I think, in practice, it is unlikely that the Revolutionary Guards, who have become Iran's most powerful political and economic institution - we're talking about 190,000 men - that they're going to defer to this group of geriatric clerics to know who is going to be their next commander-in-chief. In fact, I would go a step further to say that, in my view, it is more likely that, you know, after Khamenei dies, it could be that there is a transitional figure who is a cleric, much like there was the transitional figure of Boris Yeltsin post Soviet Union. But I think the next powerful leader of Iran is unlikely to be wearing a turban.\n\nDAVIES: We need to take another break here. Let me reintroduce you. We are speaking with Karim Sadjadpour. He is a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and formerly an analyst with the International Crisis Group based in Tehran and Washington. We recorded our interview this morning. We'll hear more after a short break.\n\nI'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF PATRICK ZIMMERLI, BRAD MEHLDAU AND KEVIN HAYS' \"GENERATRIX\")\n\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies. We are listening to the interview I recorded this morning with Karim Sadjadpour about the events in the Middle East between Israel and Iran, the potential fallout from American airstrikes on three Iranian nuclear sites over the weekend and how they may affect the authoritarian regime in Tehran. Karim Sadjadpour is a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and formerly an analyst with the International Crisis Group based in Tehran and Washington.\n\nLet's talk just a bit about the history of the nuclear program of Iran. You know, it dates back to the '50s - right? - and actually began with help from the United States.\n\nSADJADPOUR: That's right. It began during the time of the Shah decades ago, and the Shah actually had a very close relationship with the United States and had sent many Iranian students to study at MIT - study nuclear engineering - and they came back, and they played a pivotal role in building this nuclear program. And in some ways, similar to the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Shah was a little coy about his goals. On one hand, it was set up as a nuclear energy program. But I think, you know, the Shah certainly was thinking about the possibility that this could also serve down the road as a weapons program.\n\nAfter the revolution happened, the revolutionary government essentially shut down this nuclear program. They actually used some of these nuclear facilities as silos to store wheat. And Ayatollah Khomeini said that nuclear weapons are un-Islamic. And, you know, remember, we're talking about the aftermath of catastrophic events like Chernobyl, so nuclear power was...\n\nDAVIES: And this was 1979 when the revolution occurred, right?\n\nSADJADPOUR: Yeah.\n\nDAVIES: Yeah.\n\nSADJADPOUR: So for many years, nuclear power was out of vogue. They began to restart the program, you know, in the aftermath of the Iran-Iraq War when they saw how isolated they were. And, you know, it began slowly, and they built this program in a way in which they could say, this is for nuclear energy, right? Our goal is nuclear energy. It was different than the North Korean program, which was kind of a rapid dash for weapons. This was built under the guise of a nuclear energy program. And a lot of their clandestine nuclear facilities were made public shortly before the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003.\n\nAnd that's really when this became kind of an international geopolitical drama and an issue of obviously great concern for Israel and the United States. And when we look back now, it is remarkable the amount of resources that Iran has spent on this nuclear program. You know, when you consider both sunk costs and penalties for this program in terms of, you know, economic sanctions and lost oil revenue, it's easily over $500 billion - the cost of this program. And for a program which barely provided about 1% of Iran's energy needs and didn't actually serve as a deterrent - you know, Israel and the United States dropped massive bombs on Iran - so, you know, as of right now, the program has been a colossal failure for the Iranian regime.\n\nAnd for many years, the Iranian government said this is - this program is a great source of national pride. It's akin to landing on the moon. You don't hear them say that anymore because, I think, for many Iranians, they don't associate anything positive with this program apart from, you know, sanctions and isolation and war.\n\nDAVIES: Well, you know, you mentioned that it has not been an effective deterrent because, you know, the United States and Israel just recently attacked, successfully, a lot of its nuclear facilities. But I guess the counter-argument to that is, well, it's not a deterrent because it never came to fruition. If it did, it would be a mighty deterrent, right?\n\nSADJADPOUR: Well, in fact, the events of the last two weeks, I'm sure, have opened up real debates inside the Revolutionary Guards - within the Revolutionary Guards, between those who say, listen, look at the examples of Libya - Muammar Gaddafi's Libya, Saddam Hussein's Iraq, Ukraine. These were countries which either gave up their nuclear option or they failed to acquire a nuclear weapon, and all of them made themselves vulnerable to external intervention, whereas North Korea has managed to stay in power because they have this nuclear cloak of immunity.\n\nAnd so that is going to be, in my view, a real concern that - you know, in fact, I won't believe the supreme leader's end game was not the North Korea model, but what you would call the Japan model - to be a screwdriver-turn away from having a nuclear weapon, but to not turn the screw. And the reason why, in addition to the fact that he understood that Iran's nuclear facilities were totally penetrated by Israeli and U.S. intelligence - but if he actually crossed that threshold and acquired a nuclear weapon, there was a real danger for him - that he would be ceding power to the military - to the Revolutionary Guards - because they would be the ones in control of that nuclear weapon.\n\nAnd so when we're thinking now about, you know, what happens in a post-Khamenei Iran, it could very much be the case that you have a new group of leaders who have a different outlook, and they believe that Iran's mistake was having pursued a nuclear weapons capability too deliberately when, in fact, they should have pursued a nuclear weapon more rapidly.\n\nDAVIES: You know, one of the other things I've read is that if the Iranians can't develop a nuclear weapons program of their own that creates weapons, could they simply buy a weapon or weapons from a nuclear power - you know, Pakistan or North Korea? Is that a viable option?\n\nSADJADPOUR: I think, given how penetrated this Iranian system is, that is probably unlikely. And it would be profoundly unwise of Pakistan, which is Iran's neighbor, to provide it a nuclear weapon, given Iran's political instability at the moment.\n\nDAVIES: I'd like to talk about Iran's capacity to strike out against the United States or Israel in the future. I mean, it seems that its ability is sharply limited at the moment. It's lost a lot of allies and proxies in the region, right? Hamas and Hezbollah have been militarily defeated. The Syrian regime is gone. Does this mean that it is in a position where it simply will not be able to, you know, have the kind of military impact that it has? Or could it, you know, activate sleeper cells within the United States and conduct assassinations or commit, you know, civilian terrorist activities? What's your sense of that?\n\nSADJADPOUR: You know, I'm skeptical they will go to those measures, Dave, because, at the end of the day, this is a regime which wants to stay in power. They're homicidal, but not suicidal. You know, Hannah Arendt once said that even the most radical revolutionary becomes a conservative the day after the revolution because, suddenly, you have a lot you want to preserve and conserve.\n\nSo I think that Ayatollah Khamenei is in an incredibly difficult predicament at the moment. And one of the things that he has to calculate is that, if he responds too weakly, he's at risk of losing face in the eyes of his own people. But if he responds too strongly, he's at risk of losing his head. You know, President Trump has publicly threatened him with retaliation - personal retaliation if he responds.\n\nAnd many of the options that Iran has for retaliation are kind of the tactical equivalent of a suicide bombing, in that they can do enormous damage to others, but Iran may not survive the blowback. So what are those options? They could try to bomb U.S. embassies and military outposts in the Middle East, which is what they did the other day, launching a few missiles at Qatar. But that was, you know, essentially choreographed and more symbolic. They could try to bomb oil installations in places like Saudi Arabia to spike the price of oil.\n\nThey could try to block global trade corridors, like the Strait of Hormuz. They could try to rain missiles against Israel. But, again, all of these would likely trigger potentially massive U.S. and Israeli retaliation. So I suspect that, you know, at this point, it's a regime in survival mode. And if it survives, which, you know, is still a big question we can talk about, it will probably bide its time and look for opportunities to retaliate down the road when, you know, the world has moved onto other issues.\n\nDAVIES: Iran has had a relationship with Russia recently around the war in Ukraine. Is it turning to Putin for help? Is he helpful?\n\nSADJADPOUR: Putin hasn't been helpful to Iran during this latest war between Iran and Israel and the United States. And it just shows you that the Islamic Republic is one of the most strategically lonely nations in the world. Its only reliable ally was the Assad regime in Syria, which collapsed last fall. You know, much of their proxy network - like, most importantly, Hezbollah, Lebanese Hezbollah - has been decimated. And so the remaining partners they do have, have been very much transactional.\n\nYou know, China is Iran's most important economic partner - 90% of Iran's oil exports go to China. But China really hasn't been anywhere to be seen in this latest crisis, and likewise Russia. You know, Iran has provided Russia drones to fight its war in Ukraine. But, you know, we've seen in the last couple of weeks that Russia has really been on the sidelines, hasn't been able to really protect the Islamic Republic from an Israeli or American military onslaught.\n\nDAVIES: We should take another break here, so let me reintroduce you. We are speaking with Karim Sadjadpour, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and formerly an analyst at the International Crisis Group, based in Tehran and Washington. We recorded our interview this morning. We'll hear more after this break.\n\nThis is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MARC BROUSSARD'S \"INNER CITY BLUES (MAKE ME WANNA HOLLER)\")\n\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And our guest is Karim Sadjadpour, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and formerly an analyst with the International Crisis Group, based in Tehran and Washington. We recorded our interview this morning.\n\nSo you've said that the events of the past few days raise a question of whether it will embolden the regime in power in Iran or hasten its demise. So let's talk about the prospects for this. And we should note that, you know, Benjamin Netanyahu kind of encouraged this. I mean, one of - he was quoted as saying, \"a light has been lit - carry it to freedom,\" speaking to the Iranian people. This is your time. Your hour of freedom is near. It's happening now. Trump also kind of welcomed the idea on social media. Well, let's start, I guess, with the popularity or unpopularity of the Iranian regime. You said it's really not at all well-liked by its citizens, right?\n\nSADJADPOUR: That's absolutely right, Dave, because this is a regime which, in my view, has few redeeming qualities in that it's politically repressive, it's socially repressive, and it's profoundly economically mismanaged the country. And it commits this kind of repression and corruption while ruling from a moral pedestal as an Islamist theocracy. And I'll tell you, that is really insulting to people. You know, if you compare it to your run-of-the-mill autocracy, Vladimir Putin's Russia, you know, obviously, he engages in tremendous repression and corruption, but he's not - doesn't have illusions of moral superiority, saying that, you know, I'm carrying out God's will, which is what the Islamic Republic does. So this is a regime which I think many Iranians find deeply offensive.\n\nThe challenge that Iranians have had is that, you know, we know from history and the political science literature that authoritarian governments that were born out of a revolution - think, you know, Castro's Cuba, communist China, Soviet Union - they tend to be more durable than just your run-of-the-mill dictatorship, in part because there is this organizing principle, which provides cohesion for security forces. And that's something that the Islamic Republic has had. It's a regime which, in my view, perhaps has at best 20% support. But its security apparatus remains highly armed, organized and willing to kill en masse. And you have a society, for all their discontents, which at the moment is unorganized, unarmed, leaderless and not willing to die en masse.\n\nAnd I say that as actually a sign of the political maturity of the Iranian society because, in contrast to many protest movements in the Middle East which, you know, have a strong kind of Muslim Brotherhood and Islamist component to it, Iran is distinct in that it's not a secular autocracy repressing Islamist dissent. It's an Islamist autocracy which is repressing primarily secular dissent. People in Iran want to separate mosque and state, not join in mosque and state. You have a regime which venerates martyrdom, a society which doesn't believe in that. And so for that reason - you know, people often ask me, well, if so many Iranians are discontent, why don't they just go out and change the government? Well, anyone who's lived under an authoritarian regime knows that, you know, when you go out on the streets and you see 20,000 men with machine guns, it's deeply intimidating.\n\nBut like all very powerful dictators, you know, while they rule, their collapse appears inconceivable. After they've fallen, their collapse appeared inevitable. And I think we're at the stage now in the life cycle of Islamic Republic in which I think most people inside the country recognize this is a government on borrowed time. I call it a zombie regime. You know, it's a dead ideology running on repression. And, you know, part of the reason why it hasn't yet transitioned is that it's not clear to people, you know, what the alternative is going to be.\n\nDAVIES: Right, right. You know, and I think we should remember that there were mass demonstrations against the regime not long ago - what? - 2022 and '23, I mean, for women's rights and other issues. What does that experience tell us about the effectiveness of that kind of activity in Iran today?\n\nSADJADPOUR: Well, I'm glad you mentioned that, the 2022, '23 Women, Life, Freedom protests. And it shows you - as I said earlier, this is a regime which, basically, its ideological pillars are now three things - death to America, death to Israel and the mandatory veiling of women, the hijab. And all three of these things are now Achilles' heels because its antipathy toward America and Israel has led to this profound military humiliation which they're experiencing, and their obsession with the veiling of women - which, as I said, Ayatollah Khamenei once referred to it as the flag of the Islamic Revolution - that was what set off the Women, Life, Freedom protests. There was a young woman called Mahsa Amini who was detained and killed in custody for reportedly not having her hijab on properly.\n\nAnd so, again, you look at a lot of dictatorships out there - Russia, Venezuela, etc. - you know, they're socially repressive, economically repressive, but they allow people a social release. If you want, you know, you can drink alcohol or go out with your boyfriend or girlfriend. In Iran, they police even that aspect of people's lives. And so I think that, you know, it's a population which has really for years been suffocating.\n\nDAVIES: Yeah. Well, you know, and I think we should just note that those hundreds of thousands who took to the streets a few years ago showed incredible courage in doing so because the reaction was really heavy, right?\n\nSADJADPOUR: They absolutely did. There was 20,000 people who were arrested, over 500 that were killed. There's a great sociologist, Charles Kurzman, who wrote a wonderful book about the Iranian Revolution years ago, and I'm going to paraphrase him. He said, you know, the paradox of revolutionary movements is that in order to be viable, they need to attract a critical mass of people. But to attract a critical mass of people, they need to be perceived to be viable - right? - because, you know, as human beings, we don't want to join a losing team. We want to join a winning team. And that's why these tipping points and revolutionary movements happen very quickly. Once you get to 49%, then it's - your days away from 100% - right? - 'cause a critical mass of people figure out, OK, this system is not long for the world. It quickly switches.\n\nIn the Women, Life, Freedom protests, I don't think we yet got close to that tipping point. And the thing to look for these days is elite fissures, splinters at the elite level in government, you know, members of the government, senior officials defecting or, you know, questioning the supreme leader. That tends to have this effect in which, you know, the population sees that and they're emboldened by it. But I should also add, Dave, that because this is a regime and a supreme leader who also came to power through revolution, he's very aware of that mentality. And one of the modus operandis of Ayatollah Khamenei is that you never compromise when you're being pressured because if you compromise under pressure, that's not going to alleviate the pressure. It's going to project weakness and invite even more of it.\n\nAnd so for that reason, he's been a leader who's been totally inflexible, totally hostile to any meaningful political reform because he looked at the example of Gorbachev and even the shah of Iran and said that, you know, if you compromise your principles, that's not going to prolong your shelf life. That's like taking a sledgehammer to the pillars of a building. The whole thing will collapse on top of our head.\n\nDAVIES: We need to take another break here. Let me reintroduce you. We are speaking with Karim Sadjadpour. He is a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and formerly an analyst with the International Crisis Group, based in Tehran and Washington. We'll hear more after this break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF STEFON HARRIS AND BLACKOUT'S \"UNTIL\")\n\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're speaking with Karim Sadjadpour, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and formerly an analyst with the International Crisis Group, based in Tehran and Washington. We're talking about the events in the Middle East. We recorded our interview this morning.\n\nYou know, it's interesting, there's - say, since World War II, when, you know, war brought instability to a lot of regimes and a lot of authoritarian regimes were overturned, you know, the fact that a dictator falls doesn't necessarily mean that democratic and liberal values will prevail in replacing the dictator. What does history tell us about, you know, the prospects for a positive outcome when a regime is removed by an invading force or collapses under the pressure of foreign invasion or war?\n\nSADJADPOUR: It's an important question, Dave, because, you know, all of us, especially in the United States, you want to root for freedom and democracy to prevail. But in reality, since World War II, only about a quarter of authoritarian collapses have been followed by democratic government. More often, it's followed by another form of authoritarian regime. Iran, 1979, is an example of that - went from an absolute monarchy to a theocracy. The collapse of the Soviet Union is an example of that. You go from a communist system to dictatorship led by Vladimir Putin. And so it's my view that Iran has a society which is ripe for representative government. It's a wise kind of globalized citizenry, well-educated. They want to be part of the outside world. So I don't doubt the popular capacity for representative government in Iran.\n\nBut so often these authoritarian transitions are not popularity contests. They're coercive contests, and the people who, you know, commonly prevail are those not with the best ideas, but the most coercive capacity. And so the task for Iranian advocates of democracy and civil society and human rights will be to coalesce and work together and unite against the common goal because in my view, they do have strength in numbers. But if they remain disunited and you have kind of liberal forces divided amongst themselves, then a small minority can either continue to remain in power, as the Islamic Republic does, or a smaller minority can prevail in an authoritarian transition, as it did in the post Soviet Union.\n\nDAVIES: You know, we should wrap this up, but I have to ask you. As someone who is, you know, a son of Iranian parents, who has lived in the country, has many deep associations and a lot of affection for it - I don't know - when you go to bed at night, how optimistic or pessimistic do you feel about prospects there?\n\nSADJADPOUR: You know, one of the things that I've tried to focus on, Dave, in the couple decades I've been working on Iran is not to conflate my hopes and my analysis or my emotions and analysis, and that I would love to be able to say that I think Iran is going to transition into Norway or Denmark. And as I said, I think that it's a population which, you know, enormously talented. It's a country with all the benchmarks to be a G20 nation, a constructive global power, you know? - great history, civilizational identity, as I said, natural resources, culture. It's blessed in so many ways, Iran.\n\nBut I think it's been plagued by terrible political leadership over the last several decades, misplaced priorities, as I said, death to America and death to Israel rather than long live Iran. And, you know, my hope is that some great leaders will emerge from within the population, within civil society, who are able to harness the enormous popular will for change to live in a tolerant, prosperous system. But I know that that's not guaranteed. And, you know, I'm a graduate of the University of Michigan, and every year, during the NCAA brackets, the March Madness, I always fill out two brackets. One is with Michigan winning it all...\n\nDAVIES: (Laughter).\n\nSADJADPOUR: ...And the other with what I think is going to happen. And, you know, I try in this context, not to conflate things. As I said, I would like to be to say, Dave, I'm confident that the Islamic Republic is going to fall and it will be replaced by a secular liberal democracy. I do think there is the popular appetite for that. But, you know, as I said, revolutions are not commonly won or popular uprisings are not commonly won by those who have the best arguments, but it's oftentimes those with the greatest course of capacities.\n\nDAVIES: Well, Karim Sadjadpour, thank you so much for your insights.

He recently seemed to be sidelined by President Trump. Now, Netanyahu's basking in the moment after the U.S. attacked Iran.\nSponsor Message\n********\nAILSA CHANG, HOST:\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has wanted to attack Iran for decades. Initially, President Trump asked him to hold off, but all that has changed now. Israel has gone to war in Iran, and the U.S. decided to come along with him, striking Iran this past weekend. Then, today, President Trump announced on social media that Israel and Iran have reached a ceasefire, though neither country has confirmed that news. NPR's Daniel Estrin reports from Tel Aviv.\nDANIEL ESTRIN, BYLINE: Benjamin Netanyahu warned about Iran's nuclear program for more than three decades. A decade ago at the United Nations, he held up a cartoon of a bomb and said Iran was inching closer to an advanced stage of uranium enrichment.\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\nPRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: From there, it's only a few months, possibly a few weeks, before they get enough enriched uranium for the first bomb.\nESTRIN: Iran has long threatened to destroy Israel. Netanyahu long wanted to bomb Iran's nuclear facilities, but couldn't get U.S. support. Ilan Goldenberg of the advocacy group J Street used to work at the Pentagon tracking Israel-Iran tensions under the Obama administration.\nILAN GOLDENBERG: What we actually pursued during those years, and I think it's been really a consistent strategy for 20 years from the United States, has been what you might call the hug-and-punch strategy. Demonstrate to the Israelis at every step of the way, we are capable of doing this much more effectively than you are, and we've got your back, and we will do it if we need to. And at the same time, don't you do it.\nESTRIN: After President Trump announced nuclear talks with Iran this year, he said he asked Netanyahu to hold off on any attack. But by then, Israelis' own thinking had changed. Israel used to be deterred from attacking Iran by the threat of retaliation from Hamas, Hezbollah and the Syrian regime. But those threats were beaten back in the last few years of war, and Israel got some practice rounds bombing Iran. Reuven Hazan teaches political science at Hebrew University.\nREUVEN HAZAN: Hamas is almost obliterated. Hezbollah has been hit so hard that they are sitting this one out. The Syrian regime has collapsed. And we were able to fly to Iran to take out their antiaircraft missiles and to realize that now an operation like this can be done with little damage to us. So all of the chess pieces have moved, and while Netanyahu's been talking about this for decades, it is only in the last several months that this has all lined up for him and it's become possible.\nESTRIN: Over the years, Netanyahu's focus on Iran has had other political advantages. Lior Sternfeld, a Mideast historian at Penn State University, says it helped Netanyahu distract from Israel's unresolved conflict with the Palestinians.\nLIOR STERNFELD: Because every critique on Israel behavior in the West Bank and Gaza, it was always convenient to have some kind of greater risk - not just to Israel, but to the world - in the form of Iran in order to quiet critiques.\nESTRIN: The war on Iran also helped Netanyahu with problems at home. He averted his governing coalition from falling apart and sidelined widespread frustration with the Gaza war. Nadav Strauchler, a former adviser to Netanyahu, says as Trump considered whether to join in the Iran war, Netanyahu was well prepared for the moment.\nNADAV STRAUCHLER: The big trophy, the big idea, his big goal, his life's mission, was always Iran. So because he was so into it, it was, I think, easier for him to persuade Trump that this is the right thing to do.\nESTRIN: This past weekend, the U.S. bombed Iran's main nuclear sites, and Netanyahu released this video.\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\nNETANYAHU: Congratulations, President Trump. Your bold decision to target Iran's nuclear facilities with the awesome and righteous might of the United States will change history.\nESTRIN: Whether Trump and Netanyahu will continue to be in lockstep is a question, especially over Gaza. In polls, Israelis overwhelmingly support Netanyahu's war in Iran. But the one success eluding him is ending the Gaza war and freeing the remaining hostages, and that is the open wound that hurts Israelis most.
