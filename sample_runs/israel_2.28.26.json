Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told his Iranian counterpart Abbas Araghchi on Saturday that Beijing \"explicitly condemns Israel\" for its attacks against Iran and that it backs Tehran's military response to protect its national sovereignty. The comments were made when the two foreign ministers had a phone call on Saturday. \n\"China explicitly condemns Israel for violating Iran’s sovereignty, security, and territorial integrity,\" Wang said. \"China firmly opposes the brutal attacks targeting Iranian officials that have caused civilian casualties, and supports Iran in safeguarding its national sovereignty, defending its legitimate rights and interests, and protecting the safety of its people.\" \"Israel’s actions severely violate the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, as well as the basic norms of international relations,\" he continued. \"In particular, its attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities sets a dangerous precedent and could lead to catastrophic consequences.\" He added that China \"supports the international community in upholding justice and speaking out promptly\" and urges countries with influence over Israel \"to make concrete efforts to restore peace.\" \n\"China is willing to maintain communication with Iran and other relevant parties and continue to play a constructive role in easing tensions,\" Wang said. \"China hopes that Iran will ensure the safety of Chinese institutions and personnel.\" Fox News' continued coverage of the Iran-Israel conflict will continue here. \n The Israeli Defense Forces issued an evacuation order Sunday morning for Iranian civilians residing near weapons production facilities in Iran. \"Urgent warning to all Iranian citizens: All persons who are currently or in the near future present in or around military weapons production factories and their support institutions should immediately leave these areas and not return until further notice,\" an IDF spokesperson said in a statement. \n\"Your presence next to this infrastructure puts your life at risk,\" the statement continued. Posted by Landon Mion Israel's airspace \n continues to be closed amid the ongoing conflict with Iran, according to a spokesperson for the Israel Airports Authority. \"In coordination with the defense establishment, Israel's airspace remains closed to both landings and takeoffs,\" the spokesperson said in a statement. \"A notice regarding its reopening will be given with a 6-hour advance warning, with an emphasis on the safety of passengers and crew,\" the statement continued.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer confirmed the move, saying “We are moving assets to the region, including jets, and that is for contingency support in the region.\" The deployment includes fast jets and refueling aircraft from British bases, sent in response to growing threats by Iran. Tehran has warned it may target U.S., French, and British military bases in the region if those nations assist Israel in intercepting Iranian missile attacks. Starmer spoke while en route to Canada for the G7 summit, where world leaders are gathering in Alberta to discuss the conflict and other pressing global issues. He said he had spoken with President Donald Trump, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and additional leaders about ways to reduce tensions.\n “These are intense discussions,” Starmer said, noting that the summit would continue talks on how to prevent further escalation. Posted by Jasmine Baehr Three drones targeting a base housing U.S. troops in western Iraq were intercepted and shot down following Israel’s airstrikes on Iran, according to two American officials cited by The Associated Press. The attempted drone attack occurred near the Ain al-Asad air base and did not result in any injuries or damage, officials confirmed. No group has claimed responsibility for the incident. \nBoth U.S. officials spoke on condition of anonymity, as they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. Ain al-Asad base has hosted U.S. and coalition forces for years and has previously been the target of rocket and drone attacks, primarily by Iran-backed militias. While groups have sometimes launched strikes on American assets in the region, they had remained mostly quiet amid the recent escalation between Israel and Iran.

Posted by Jasmine Baehr ​ \nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has released new footage showing a dramatic moment during overnight operations in which an Israeli Air Force (IAF) combat helicopter intercepted and destroyed a drone launched from Iran. The video shows the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) locked in the helicopter crew’s targeting system receiving visual confirmation of the drone being successfully hit midair. According to the IDF, the UAV was one of several launched by Iran as part of the ongoing wave of aerial attacks on Israel. The incident occurred during the early hours of Sunday, as part of Israel’s broader defense operations in response to repeated missile and drone assaults. The IAF has been using a range of aerial assets, including helicopters, fighter jets, and defense systems, to track and neutralize threats before they reach Israeli population centers or infrastructure. Posted by Jasmine Baehr Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is “not off limits” from attacks by Israel as the two nations continue escalating. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, an official said Israel is not dismissing any options that would lead to the destruction of Iran’s nuclear program. The official signaled Israel’s goal is not to just destroy the nuclear program but to take down the Iranian regime’s commanding body and military. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz sent a sharp warning to Khamenei on Saturday local time. \n\"The Iranian dictator is turning Iran’s citizens into hostages and creating a reality in which they — especially the residents of Tehran — will pay a heavy price for the criminal attacks against Israeli civilians,” Katz said. “If Khamenei continues to fire missiles at Israel’s home front – Tehran will burn,\" he added. Israel has marked significant blows to Tehran's military leadership, eliminating a slew of key military figures and scientists while dismantling Iran’s physical nuclear infrastructure. The official shared the underground Natanz facility, which contains centrifuges for enriching uranium, has most likely imploded. Insight from the official says the war will result in either a voluntary dismantling of the nuclear program or further complications from Israel for the reconstitution of the program, WSJ reported. Posted by Ashley DiMella Iran’s ongoing missile assault continues to devastate Israeli cities. According to Israeli emergency services Magen David Adom (MDA), six people have been killed and 54 injured so far in Sunday’s latest attack. Five of the fatalities occurred in Tamra, an Arab city near Haifa, and one in Bat Yam, just south of Tel Aviv. MDA teams report that several more remain trapped under rubble in Bat Yam, where heavy residential damage was seen following direct impacts. The death toll has since risen to 10 and at least 180 are now confirmed injured. \nThis continues a relentless wave of ballistic missiles from Iran, six barrages in under three days, with urban populations bearing the brunt. Earlier, an apartment building in southern Tel Aviv was demolished. Rescue efforts are ongoing in Bat Yam and Tamra.

In a post Saturday on X, Macron said his “first message” to Pezeshkian was to demand the immediate release of two French nationals, Cécile Kohler and Jacques Paris, who are in Iranian custody. “My first message was to demand the immediate release of our compatriots, Cécile Kohler and Jacques Paris, who have been held hostages by the Iranian regime in unacceptable conditions for over three years,” Macron wrote. Macron also warned of growing regional instability and called for the safety of diplomatic personnel and citizens throughout the region. \n“In light of the serious risk of destabilization across the region, I called for our diplomatic facilities and nationals in Iran and the wider region not to be targeted under any circumstances,” he said. “I also urged the utmost restraint to avoid escalation.” Macron noted that Iran’s nuclear program remains “a serious concern” and insisted that diplomacy is the only way forward. “I therefore invited President Pezeshkian to return swiftly to the negotiating table to reach an agreement — the only viable path to de-escalation.” He concluded by offering France’s support to help broker a peaceful resolution: “We stand ready to contribute and to mobilize all our efforts to achieve that goal.” Posted by Jasmine Baehr \n The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced Sunday morning that the Israeli Air Force (IAF) completed a major round of airstrikes targeting infrastructure linked to Iran’s nuclear weapons program inside Tehran. According to the official statement, the operation was intelligence-based and focused on high-value strategic sites used by the Iranian regime to advance and conceal its nuclear ambitions. Among the facilities targeted were the Iranian Ministry of Defense headquarters, the headquarters of the SPND nuclear project, and additional locations where the regime stored elements of its nuclear archive. \nThe IDF stated: “A short while ago, the IAF completed an extensive series of intelligence-based strikes on a number of targets in Tehran related to the Iranian regime’s nuclear weapons project.” The SPND has long been assessed by Israeli and Western intelligence services as a key player in Iran’s covert efforts to develop nuclear weapons. The IDF also confirmed strikes on fuel tankers connected to Iran’s military infrastructure. This latest action represents one of Israel’s most direct attacks on the heart of Iran’s nuclear program. Iranian authorities have not yet issued a formal response. Posted by Jasmine Baehr ​ The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed early Sunday morning that a sixth wave of missiles has been launched from Iran toward Israeli territory, continuing a steady escalation in hostilities between the two nations. In a statement issued just after the latest sirens sounded across parts of the country, the IDF said: “A short while ago, the IDF identified missiles launched from Iran toward the territory of the State of Israel.” \nIsrael’s air defense systems are currently intercepting incoming threats, as residents were again forced into shelters. Civilians were instructed to follow emergency protocols. Explosions echoed across Tel Aviv as the latest missiles struck. According to Fox News chief foreign correspondent Trey Yingst, there were \"multiple direct hits in the last barrage,\" with \"significant damage to an apartment building in central Israel.\" Yingst reported that rescue crews are currently on the scene. This marks the sixth consecutive barrage from Iran in just three days, following Israel’s precision airstrikes on Iranian military and nuclear targets. The IDF has warned that additional threats remain possible, urging the public to stay alert and comply with all Home Front Command instructions. Posted by Jasmine Baehr The U.S. Department of State issued a security alert telling U.S. citizens to “depart Iran immediately if they are there,\" adding that Americans “should not travel to Iran for any reason.” For any Americans in Iran, the department said they should be prepared to shelter in place for extended periods, wrote the U.S. Virtual Embassy in Iran posted early Sunday morning local time. “U.S. citizens in Iran face serious, increasing dangers due to rising regional tensions. The U.S. government does not have diplomatic or consular relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran,” the alert added. The Embassy of Switzerland in Tehran serves as the protecting power for United States interests. There is no physical United States presence in Iran.\n Diplomatic relations between the United States and Iran were severed in 1980 after sixty-six Americans were taken hostage at the American Embassy in Tehran. Iranian airspace remains closed while the Armenian and Turkish borders remain open. Azerbaijan’s land borders remain closed, but with special authorization, U.S. citizens may be able to cross. Posted by Ashley DiMella Ali Shamkhani, Iran’s former Supreme National Security Council (SNSC) Secretary, was killed in an Israeli airstrike on Friday, according to Iranian state media reports.

Posted by Jasmine Baehr An Israeli airstrike struck a target in Yemen late Saturday, in what is being reported as a direct attempt to eliminate a senior Houthi military leader. The Times of Israel cited defense officials and on-the-ground reporting that the target of the strike was believed to be Houthi Chief of Staff Muhammad al-Omari. Israeli military officials have not formally acknowledged the operation. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has yet to release a statement regarding the strike. \nAccording to the Times of Israel, the strike was understood to be a targeted assassination, which points to Israel’s increasing focus on neutralizing regional threats linked to Iranian proxy groups. The Houthis, a Tehran-backed militant faction based in Yemen, have been vocal supporters of Iran amid the escalating conflict with Israel and are known to possess long-range missile capabilities. They have previously threatened to target Israeli interests in solidarity with Iran. This reported strike follows several days of intense military activity in the region.

Posted by Jasmine Baehr ​ Sirens rang out across parts of Israel late Saturday, as Iran launched a fifth barrage of missiles into the country, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). Israeli defensive systems intercepted several incoming ballistic threats in northern Israel. \nIn a post on X, IDF Spokesperson LTC Nadav Shoshani confirmed: \"While the IDF is operating to intercept missiles launched from Iran, the IAF is currently striking military targets in Tehran.” This marks the fifth wave of Iranian missile fire since hostilities escalated on Friday, following Israel’s targeted airstrikes on Iranian nuclear and military assets. Fox News chief foreign correspondent Trey Yingst, reporting live from Tel Aviv, said, “Iran began firing more missiles into Israel moments ago.” Fox News captured footage of more than 15 ballistic missiles streaking across the night sky, likely headed toward Haifa, a northern Israeli port city. “The entirety of the country has gotten an alert to head into bomb shelters,” Yingst reported, noting some of the missiles were intercepted midair with audible booms heard as Israeli defense systems engaged. \n“We do know some of them were intercepted,” he said, adding that initial reports confirm at least one impact in Haifa. “This is a significant attack.” Yingst also reported that Israeli forces have eliminated 30 senior officials in Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) after tricking them into a meeting location that was subsequently struck. “Israeli officials tell us the Americans are indeed helping to shoot down these incoming missiles,” Yingst added, pointing to the use of Patriot or THAAD systems. A senior Israeli intelligence source told Fox News their objectives are clear: weaken Iran’s nuclear program, destroy its missile capabilities, and stop what they call an existential threat to Israel. Israeli defense officials are urging continued caution as tensions remain high. Posted by Jasmine Baehr Following a birthday call from Russian President Vladimir Putin, President Donald Trump said both leaders agreed the Israel‑Iran conflict “should end.” “President Putin called this morning to very nicely wish me a Happy Birthday, but to more importantly, talk about Iran, a country he knows very well,” Trump posted on Truth Social Saturday. “We talked at length. Much less time was spent talking about Russia/Ukraine, but that will be for next week. … He feels, as do I, this war in Israel‑Iran should end, to which I explained, his war should also end.” \nTrump included that the two had discussed Russia-Ukraine prisoner exchanges: “He is doing the planned prisoner swaps – large numbers of prisoners are being exchanged, immediately, from both sides.” Russian state media, citing Reuters, confirmed Putin condemned Israel’s strikes and called on Premier Benjamin Netanyahu to pursue negotiations over Iran’s nuclear program. The Kremlin statement said Putin “stressed the importance of a return to the process of talks and resolution of all issues concerning Iran’s nuclear programme strictly through political and diplomatic means.” The Reuters report also noted that Russia condemned Israeli operations as “unprovoked military strikes” and urged both sides to “exercise restraint in order to prevent a further escalation of tensions and the descent of the region into full‑scale war.” Moscow and Tehran have deepened cooperation in recent years, signing a 20‑year strategic partnership pact in January. \nReuters notes that Russia “would remain in close contact with both Iran and Israel,” and offered to help facilitate nuclear diplomacy, including removing highly enriched uranium from Iran to convert it to civilian reactor fuel. Posted by Jasmine Baehr ​ A senior Israeli intelligence official tells Fox News that 30 Iranian military officers were killed in a targeted Israeli airstrike that decimated Iran’s Air Force and Air Defense leadership. The operation, described by Israeli sources as a “historic achievement,” was part of a broader response to Iran’s fourth wave of missile attacks on Israel. Fox News chief foreign correspondent Trey Yingst, reporting from Tel Aviv, said the Iranian barrage sent millions of Israelis into bomb shelters overnight. Despite most missiles being intercepted, one struck a neighborhood near Tel Aviv, killing three civilians and injuring more than 70. In response, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) launched fresh airstrikes on more than 150 targets inside Iran, including 40 air defense sites. The IDF now claims aerial superiority over Tehran. \n“We paved the way to Tehran,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Saturday. “Our pilots over the skies of Tehran will deal blows to the Ayatollah regime that they cannot even imagine.” The Israeli intelligence official told Fox News the strike on Iran’s senior military leaders was made possible by a deception operation. Israeli forces reportedly manipulated movements on the ground to lure senior IRGC Air Force officials into a single location, which was then struck. Yingst reports that Israel is preparing for continued conflict in the coming days, as Iran is believed to have around 2,000 ballistic missiles remaining. “We have lots of surprises… more surprises coming up,” the Israeli official said.

One key site destroyed was an underground complex in Khorramabad, which contained launch shafts and dozens of missiles stored in tunnels. “These could have been launched at Israel last night,” Defrin noted. “Our preliminary planning and intelligence enabled us to thwart parts of Iran’s planned attack.” The IDF also confirmed airstrikes on two critical nuclear sites: the Natanz enrichment plant and the Isfahan conversion facility. In addition, nine senior Iranian nuclear scientists have been “neutralized,” according to Defrin. Despite the IDF’s success in degrading Iran’s capabilities, Iran managed to launch missiles at Israel overnight. Three Israeli civilians were killed. \n“We have excellent and advanced aerial defense systems, but they are not airtight,” Defrin said. “Your composure and resilience as citizens are commendable.” Protective measures remain in effect across Israel. Schools will be closed Sunday. Meanwhile, IDF forces continue combat operations on multiple fronts: in Gaza, the north, Judea and Samaria, and along the Lebanon and Syria borders. Defrin also addressed the families of 53 hostages still held in Gaza: “They remain our supreme mission in this war.

While Israeli experts have warned for years that Iran was enriching uranium at a level that put it \"weeks away\" from a nuclear weapon, in recent days, there has been a shift. According to Israeli intelligence sources, Iran was on the verge of assembling a crude nuclear device. \nBeni Sabti, an Iran expert at the Institute of National Security Studies, told Fox News Digital the threat was urgent and specific: Tehran was pulling its materials together \"in a secret place near Tehran to make a primitive warhead.\" Gregg Roman, executive director of the Middle East Forum, said that since the Trump administration reinitiated nuclear negotiations, Israel had been collecting fresh intelligence that raised alarm bells. This is an excerpt from an article written by Fox News' Morgan Phillips. Posted by Rachel Wolf Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised that soon there would be Air Force pilots over Tehran. In his address to the people of Israel, he vowed that the country would \"fight until victory\" as they work to \"foil a double threat from Iran,\" referring to nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. \"We have paved a way to Tehran. Very soon you’ll see the Air Force pilots over the sky of Tehran. We will hit every target, site of the Ayatollah's regime. What they have felt so far is nothing in compared to what they will feel,\" Netanyahu said.\n The prime minister also addressed the barrage of Iranian missiles that forced Israelis into bomb shelters and left three dead and nearly 70 wounded. He said that he was proud of his people and saddened by the loss of life. Netanyahu also hinted at more to come, saying that Israel was \"doing more things that I cannot elaborate on.\" \"We will do whatever needed to remove this double threat over Israel,\" Netanyahu said. Posted by Rachel Wolf Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi announced Saturday that his country will not hold talks with the U.S. tomorrow about its nuclear program, which were set to take place in Oman, a report said.  \nAraghchi told European Union foreign-policy chief Kaja Kallas that Iran will not engage in the conversations for now, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing a person briefed on a call between them.  \"The Iran U.S. talks scheduled to be held in Muscat this Sunday will not now take place. But diplomacy and dialogue remain the only pathway to lasting peace,\" Oman's Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi wrote on X. The development comes after an Iranian official reportedly called the talks “meaningless” in the wake of Israel’s airstrikes.  \n\"The other side [the U.S.] acted in a way that makes dialogue meaningless. You cannot claim to negotiate and at the same time divide work by allowing the Zionist regime [Israel] to target Iran's territory,\" Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei was quoted by state media as saying, according to Reuters.  Posted by Greg Norman ​ The IDF announced on Saturday that it had \"established aerial superiority from western Iran to Tehran\" just two days into Operation Rising Lion. Overnight, Iran retaliated against Israel and launched several missile barrages that killed three and wounded as many as 70 people. Posted by Rachel Wolf Former U.S. men's Olympics gold medalist and current transgender conservative influencer  Caitlyn Jenner is trapped in Israel after the nation initiated a strike on Iran Thursday night.  Jenner traveled to the country to attend the Pride Month parade in Tel Aviv scheduled for Friday.  Jenner shared several social media posts declaring allegiance with Israel and showing sites of the country and subsequent chaos. \nOn Friday evening, Jenner posted about being in bomb shelters in Tel Aviv as  Iran launches retaliatory missile strikes against the city.  \"We are back in the shelters in Tel Aviv. This looks like it is the third wave of attack from Iran,\" Jenner wrote.  In a post on Instagram and X Friday morning, Jenner shared a photo from the Western Wall in the Old City of Jerusalem with a caption that said, \"Yesterday in Jerusalem. My heart is with Israel now and forever. Evil shall not prevail!\" The post included Israeli and U.S. flag emoji. This is an excerpt from an article written by Fox News' Jackson Thompson. Posted by Rachel Wolf \n ​ Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth told Fox News on Saturday that President Donald Trump is “dialed in” when it comes to monitoring the conflict between Israel \n and Iran, adding that “this is not an autopen moment.”  “We had that, where the world saw our gaze distracted, or not paying attention at all,” Hegseth continued, referencing Trump’s investigation into the Biden administration over allegations that top officials used autopen signatures to cover up the former president's cognitive decline.  Hegseth added that the U.S. is “robustly postured” to defend American assets in the Middle East from any future aggression from Iran. On Friday, Tehran launched retaliatory airstrikes against Tel Aviv and Israel, killing at least 3 people.  \n“The president has been leading the way on setting the tempo of how we look at the region and ultimately recognize a couple a days ago, Israel believed in its own self-defense, it needed to take action against nuclear capabilities and ballistic missiles and we saw the response from Iran,” Hegseth said. “The U.S. is postured to defend our people in the region. We have got significant assets in the region. We are robustly postured to ensure our people, our bases, our interests are safe and we are continuing to monitor.”  “We will keep Americans safe,” Hegseth also said. “You saw what Secretary [of State] Rubio said in his first statement, ultimately, it should be clear to Iran that they should not turn their gaze to the United States, that would be a bad idea.”  Posted by Greg Norman Posted by Rachel Wolf Israeli Ambassador to the U.N. Danny Danon said on Friday that prior to the strike on Iran, Jerusalem found that Tehran was planning a \"surprise attack\" that would have included a ground invasion. \n\"Israel uncovered clear evidence that the Iranian regime was planning a surprise attack in coordination with its proxies. They had planned to invade from all sides with thousands of terrorists and thousands of projectiles,\" Danon told reporters. \"As you know, October 7 was a deeply painful and traumatic day for all of us, but the danger we confronted last night was of a different magnitude: a surprise attack with a nuclear strike, which Iran was preparing for, would've been terminal. Israel could not and would not wait for that moment to arrive,\" he added. Posted by Rachel Wolf The IDF has given more insight into the Iranian officials killed in Operation Rising Lion, which began with an unprecedented preemptive strike early Friday morning local time. So far, the IDF says it has managed to kill the head of Iran's Intelligence Directorate and the commander of the IRGC's Surface-To-Surface Missile Array. \nGholamreza Mehrabi, who served as the head of Iran's Intelligence Directorate, allegedly \"played a key role\" in operational planning, combat preparations and intelligence evaluations, according to the IDF. Israel also noted that Marhabi was considered to be \"Iran's most senior intelligence officer.\" Mohammad Bagheri, commander of the IRGC’s Surface-To-Surface Missile Array, was also killed. The IDF said that he oversaw most of Iran's long-range surface-to-surface missiles, which would have served as Iran's \"primary offensive tools\" against Israel. Furthermore, the IDF said that Bagheri was part of the decision-making process behind Iran's attacks on Israel in April and October 2024. Posted by Rachel Wolf IDF International Spokesperson Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani accused Iran of trying to push a \"fake victory narrative.\" However, he said that it was \"not going very well\" for Teheran. \nShoshani's post was in response to reports that Iran shot down Israeli fighter jets, a claim that Jerusalem denies. Posted by Rachel Wolf ​ \nOn Saturday, the IDF released footage of the Israeli Air Force and Navy intercepting UAVs from Iran. The announcement comes after many Israelis spent the night running in and out of protected spaces due to Iranian missile barrages. Posted by Rachel Wolf The Associated Press is reporting that Iran's state TV showed a fire following an Israeli strike on a former car manufacturing plant. Additionally, the Associated Press said that state-run IRNA news agency reported an Israeli strike in the southwestern province of Khuzestan. Earlier on Saturday, Israel announced that it was carrying out more strikes on Iran following overnight missile barrages from Tehran. Posted by Rachel Wolf A senior Israeli intelligence official exclusively told Fox News on Saturday that “We have more surprises coming up” for Iran following the initial wave of strikes during “Operation Rising Lion.”  \nThe high-ranking source, speaking to Fox News Chief Foreign Correspondent Trey Yingst, said Israeli intelligence projected Iran would have an arsenal of 8,000 ballistic missiles over the next two years and that this was part of the reason a decision was made to launch the operation. Right now, Israel believes Iran has about 2,000 missiles.    “We cannot end this operation knowing that we will be in the same spot two years from now,” the official said. “Everything is going as planned. Actually, better than planned.”  The official added: “We have lots of surprises. Not just the ones we already did. We have more surprises coming up.”  Forty Iranian air defense systems were hit since the beginning of the operation, which is based on three goals -- targeting Iran’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs and removing the Iranian existential threat against Israel.   During the initial strike against a meeting of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) air force officials, Israeli intelligence assesses that 30 commanders were killed.  “It’s a historic achievement,” the official said.  Israel now expects more incoming Iranian missiles in the days ahead that will cause casualties and destruction.    The bulk of the conflict with Iran could largely be over in a matter of days.    “I think we can finish it in days… It’s a good thing that we have the U.S. by our side,” the official said.  The official also told Fox News that the U.S. is “fully coordinated” with Israel, yet declined to go into specifics.   \n“The way the U.S. is standing beside Israel is unprecedented,” he said. “We feel it.” Fox News' Trey Yingst contributed to this report.   Posted by Greg Norman Israel’s strikes on Iran are as righteous as they are daring. As I write this, the Israeli Defense Forces are conducting precision operations that have already degraded Iran's nuclear infrastructure and eliminated key figures in their military hierarchy. These attacks aren’t just justified – they’re absolutely necessary. Prime Minister Netanyahu \n has indicated that Israel is prepared for sustained operations lasting days or weeks. With intelligence suggesting the Islamic Republic is close to acquiring nuclear capabilities, waiting to act is not an option. Israel understands that their very survival is at stake, and is acting accordingly. Their fight is America’s – and the free world’s – fight. President Donald Trump is absolutely right to make it clear to the Iranians that America isn’t playing their game anymore. The United States, our Gulf allies, and all countries that seek a free, peaceful, and prosperous future must unite in opposition to the Iranian regime and in support of Israel’s objectives. This is an excerpt from an article by former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Click here to read more. Posted by Rachel Wolf Yisrael Aloni, 73, was reportedly identified as one of the three people killed in Irans missile barrage attack against Israel, according to the Times of Israel. The outlet also noted that he was killed during a barrage on the city of Rishon Lezion. Fox News' Alex Hogan reported early Saturday morning that three people were killed and as many as 70 were wounded in the Iranian attack. Posted by Rachel Wolf ​ The Israel Defense Forces released multiple new videos Saturday showing Iranian missile platforms and drones being destroyed by its forces.  “The Air Force continues to strike dozens of surface-to-surface missile platforms in Iran. This is how we accurately struck surface-to-surface missile platforms ready to launch,” IDF Arabic Spokesperson Avichay Adraee wrote on X.  In one video, missile platforms could be seen exploding into flames after being hit by Israeli airstrikes.  In another, a drone is seen flying through the air \nbefore it gets hit and starts spewing out dark smoke.  \"We continue to hunt down threats and strike targets deep within the Iranian regime,\" Adraee said.  Posted by Greg Norman \nIsraeli Defense Minister Israel Katz sent a stark warning to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as tensions between their two nations continue to rise. \"The Iranian dictator is turning Iran’s citizens into hostages and creating a reality in which they — especially the residents of Tehran — will pay a heavy price for the criminal attacks against Israeli civilians. If Khamenei continues to fire missiles at Israel’s home front – Tehran will burn,\" Katz said following a situation assessment with IDF Chief of the General Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir and top IDF officials. Posted by Rachel Wolf Iran has reportedly confirmed that its Fordow nuclear site was damaged, according to Reuters, which cited the semi-official ISNA news agency. \"There has been limited damage to some areas at the Fordow enrichment site,\" state atomic energy agency spokesperson Behrouz Kamalvandi said, according to Reuters. \"We had already moved a significant part of the equipment and materials out, and there was no extensive damage and there are no contamination concerns.\"  It is unclear whether this was a direct result of an Israeli strike, as an IDF official said on Saturday that Israel did not hit Fordow. Posted by Rachel Wolf Elon Musk seemed to indicate that Starlink was made available to the people of Iran after reports of the country limiting internet access following Israeli airstrikes. During a Friday appearance on \"Hannity,\" Mark Levin, the host of \"Life, Liberty and Levin,\" \n called on Musk to \"turn on Starlink\" for the people of Iran. Levin then tweeted about the possibility of Musk turning on Starlink to which the Tesla founder replied, \"the beams are on.\" Posted by Rachel Wolf \nIranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi held a phone call last night with U.N. Secretary General António Guterres in which he told him that Israel’s airstrikes “constitute a blatant violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Islamic Republic of Iran, as an independent U.N. member state, and are a clear act of aggression.”  “The foreign minister reiterated Iran’s determination to defend itself in line with Article 51 of the U.N. Charter and urged the Security Council and the secretary general to fulfill their responsibilities under the Charter by strongly condemning this aggression and taking immediate and concrete measures to hold the Israeli regime accountable,” Iran’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement.  \n“The U.N. secretary general voiced regret over the Israeli aggression and condemned its attacks against Iran, particularly the strikes on nuclear facilities at a time when talks between Iran and the U.S. were ongoing. He underscored his commitment to using U.N. mechanisms to help de-escalate tensions and restore peace and stability in the region,” it added.  Posted by Greg Norman ​ At least two people have been killed following four rounds of Iranian missile strikes into Israel. \nAn Israeli woman who was critically wounded by Iranian missiles died from her wounds she sustained in attacks late Friday in Tel Aviv, the Jerusalem Post reported, and another person was killed after a fourth wave of strikes decimated a residential area at dawn Saturday in central Israel. In addition, several homes in Tel Aviv were reportedly damaged by Iranian ballistic missiles as first responders searched for survivors. Iran launched missile strikes targeting various parts of Israel on Friday night and early Saturday morning. Images posted online showed homes destroyed and others with partial damage. \nMagen David Adom, Israel's national EMS, said it was treating and evacuating 21 people after a rocket strike into a residential area in the country's coastal plain.

Mission to Iran issued a letter to the U.N. Security Council, saying the U.S., as a “backer” of Israel, “shall be held fully accountable.”\nThe letter condemned what it called a “serious threat to international security” after the strikes killed “four military commanders, one Iranian official allegedly involved in the nuclear talks with the U.S., and two nuclear scientists.”\nEarlier this week, ahead of a now-cancelled meeting between the U.S. and Iran in Oman, Iranian Defense Minister Aziz Nasirzadeh said: “If a conflict is imposed on us …all U.S. bases are within our reach, and we will boldly target them in host countries.”\nThe Trump administration announced a partial evacuation of the U.S. embassy in Iraq and authorized military dependents to leave certain locations in the region.\nPresident Trump told reporters: “We have a lot of American people in this area. And I said, we got to tell them to get out because something could happen soon, and I don't want to be the one that didn't give any warning and missiles are flying into their buildings.”\nAccording to October 2024 Defense Department figures, about 40,000 U.S. service members are stationed across the Middle East. The U.S. operates at least 19 sites in countries including Bahrain, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and the UAE, eight of which are permanent.\nIran analyst Behnam Ben Taleblu of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies said: “Given the fact that in January 2020, Iran launched short-range, precision strike ballistic missiles at U.S. bases in Iraq for killing Qasem Soleimani… this is not a theoretical exercise.”\n“There is a political element to the regime continuously threatening America… to put as much daylight between America and Israel as possible.”\n*Fox News Digital's Caitlin McFall contributed to this report.*\nPosted by Jasmine Baehr[Share] \n## Scott Jennings stranded in Israel during Iranian missile attack\n[] \nCNN political contributor and Trump supporter Scott Jennings was stuck in Israel following Iran’s retaliatory attacks on Friday.\n“There have been a few surprises that I didn’t anticipate during my trip to Israel, to say the least,” Jennings, who shared with his X followers on Monday that he would be off TV for a week due to a trip to Israel, wrote on X early Saturday local time.\n“President Trump told Iran they had 60 days to make a deal. They didn't listen. Now they're paying the price,” he wrote earlier in a separate post. “What's incredible is that the US and Israel actively planned for this scenario of non-compliance. What they pulled off is miraculous.”\nJennings also posted several videos from his hotel on the Sea of Galilee of missile intercepts.\nFollowing Israel’s airstrikes on Iran early Friday, he wrote, “Quick update: not much has happened since my last updates.

If we don’t act now, we simply won’t be here.”\nHe said that Iran has enriched enough uranium for nine nuclear bombs, and that in recent months it took unprecedented steps toward weaponization.\n[![Embedded YouTube video]] \nIran has also built “a massive store” of ballistic missiles, he continued. “These missiles reach Israel from Iran within minutes.

The inclusion of bipartisan political reactions (e.g., opposition support for Israel’s “right to defend itself”) reflects domestic consensus on Iran’s perceived threat but avoids deeper scrutiny of the strikes’ legality under international law—a contrast to earlier critiques ([theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025](https://www.theguardian.com)). \n\nThe article also highlights Australia’s proactive crisis management, with Dfat’s advisories and embassy closures illustrating the tangible fallout of escalating conflict.

Miller\nCOLUMBIA LAW REVIEW\nVOL. 124 MAY 2024 NO. 4\nABSTRACTS\nARTICLES\nTOWARD NAKBA AS A LEGAL CONCEPT Rabea Eghbariah 887\nThe law does not possess the language that we desperately need to\naccurately capture the totality of the Palestinian condition. From\noccupation to apartheid and genocide, the most commonly applied legal\nconcepts rely on abstraction and analogy to reveal particular facets of\nsubordination. This Article introduces Nakba as a legal concept to\nresolve this tension. Meaning “Catastrophe” in Arabic, the term “al\u0002Nakba” (ةᚁالنك (is often used to refer to the ruinous process of\nestablishing the State of Israel in Palestine. But the Nakba has\nundergone a metamorphosis; it has evolved from a historical calamity\ninto a brutally sophisticated structure of oppression. This ongoing\nNakba includes episodes of genocide and variants of apartheid but\nremains rooted in a historically and analytically distinct foundation,\nstructure, and purpose.\nThis Article therefore proposes to distinguish apartheid, genocide,\nand Nakba as different, yet overlapping, modalities of crimes against\nhumanity. It first identifies Zionism as Nakba’s ideological counterpart\nand insists on understanding these concepts as mutually constitutive.\nConsidering the limits of existing legal frameworks, this Article goes on\nto analyze the legal anatomy of the ongoing Nakba. It positions\ndisplacement as the Nakba’s foundational violence, fragmentation as\nits structure, and the denial of self-determination as its purpose. Taken\ntogether, these elements give substance to a concept in the making that\nmay prove useful in other contexts as well.\nVALUING SOCIAL DATA Amanda Parsons 993\n& Salomé Viljoen\nSocial data production—accumulating, processing, and using\nlarge volumes of data about people—is a unique form of value creation\nthat characterizes the digital economy. Social data production also\npresents critical challenges for the legal regimes that encounter it. This\nArticle provides scholars and policymakers with the tools to comprehend\nthis new form of value creation through two descriptive contributions.\nFirst, it presents a theoretical account of social data, a mode of\nproduction that is cultivated and exploited for two distinct (albeit\nrelated) forms of value: prediction value and exchange value. Second,\nit creates and defends a taxonomy of three “scripts” that companies\nfollow to build up and leverage prediction value and explains their\nnormative and legal ramifications.\nThrough the examples of tax and data privacy law, the Article\napplies these descriptive contributions to demonstrate how legal regimes\nfail to effectively regulate social data value creation. Tax law\ndemonstrates how legal regimes historically tasked with regulating\nvalue creation struggle with this new form of value creation. Data\nprivacy law shows how legal regimes that have historically regulated\nsocial data struggle with regulating data’s role in value creation.\nThe Article argues that separately analyzing data’s prediction\nvalue and its exchange value is helpful to understanding the challenges\nthe law faces in governing social data production and its surrounding\npolitical economy. This improved understanding will equip legal\nscholars to better confront the harms of law’s failures in the digital\neconomy, reduce legal arbitrage by powerful actors, and facilitate\nopportunities to maximize the beneficial potential of social data value.\nNOTES\nTOWARD DISTRIBUTED NATURE:\nTHE AFFORESTATION EASEMENT\nAND A REGENERATIVE LAND ETHIC Isaac Lunt 1081\nAnthropogenic climate change is altering humanity’s relationship\nto the natural world. As extreme weather events become more frequent\nand biodiversity plummets, humankind has three responsibilities: lower\ncarbon dioxide emissions, preserve what remains of the natural world,\nand generate new pockets of nature to slowly rebuild what we have\ndestroyed.\nTrees—particularly when grouped together in forests—are\nhumanity’s allies. Yet while tree planting is an often-hailed solution to\nclimate change, few legal tools exist in the United States to foster\nafforestation on private land. Current federal programs directed at tree\nplanting focus on lumber production or agriculture, with little\nattention to small-scale afforestation projects aimed at restoring and\nrecreating the natural world.\nThis Note joins a growing body of literature suggesting that\nindividual property owners can make a difference in the fight against\nclimate change by supporting natural landscapes. It terms a subset of\nthese efforts “distributed nature” and posits that incentivizing property\nowners to engage in distributed nature requires legal intervention. It\nthen suggests a legal tool, the afforestation easement, which would\nprovide individual landowners with tax benefits for donating their\nland for permanent afforestation. Along the way, it reimagines the\nconcept of “conservation” to include setting aside land not only for\nstatic preservation but also for dynamic regeneration.\nIN THE GOVERNMENT’S SHOES:\nASSESSING THE LEGITIMACY OF\nSTATE QUI TAM PROVISIONS Erik Ramirez 1121\nRecently, a wave of state legislatures have enacted qui tam\nprovisions to police citizen behavior in a variety of politically and legally\ncontentious environments. The current literature on private enforce\u0002ment views qui tam as a homogenous species of private enforcement and\ndoes little to identify any distinctions within qui tam itself. This gap in\nthe scholarship has made it difficult to assess the legitimacy of the\nrecently adopted state qui tam provisions. This Note adds to this\nliterature by identifying distinctions between different forms of qui tam\nand creating a Taxonomy that places a qui tam provision within six\ndistinct categories according to the nature of the underlying govern\u0002mental claim, the practical effect of the provision, and the normative\nvalues underlying the provision.\nFRAUD AND FEDERALISM:\nHOW THE MODERN COURT HAS USED THE\nMEANING OF “PROPERTY” TO RESHAPE\nFEDERAL FRAUD JURISPRUDENCE Benjamin G. Smith 1157\nFor the past several decades, the Supreme Court has repeatedly\nsought to reinterpret the meaning of “property” within federal fraud\nstatutes to limit the degree to which federal prosecutors can regulate\nstate official misconduct. While the Court’s renewed interest in the\nfederal fraud statutes has drawn varying degrees of praise and criticism\nfrom different sides of the legal community, this Note seeks to assess—\nin an apolitical, value-neutral fashion—whether the Court’s doctrinal\napproach is effective in furthering the stated goal of drawing\nboundaries between federal and state actors in corruption cases. The\nNote first undertakes a deep-dive analysis of the evolution of the Court’s\nmail and wire fraud jurisprudence. It then shows how even the most\nfaithful applications of the Court’s fraud doctrine lead to inconsistent\noutcomes and fail to provide lower courts or prosecutors with clear\nguidance on exactly what types of misconduct can fall within the\npurview of the fraud statutes. Concluding that the dissonance between\nthe Court’s clearly stated ideological objectives and the actual black\u0002letter law of fraud jurisprudence is unsustainable, this Note explores\nalternative doctrinal approaches that might fix the current state of\nfraud jurisprudence. This Note contributes to the existing body of\nscholarship by not only offering a detailed accounting of the current\nstate of fraud jurisprudence, but also providing a lens to analyze\nSupreme Court decisions that can be applied well beyond the fraud\nstatutes themselves.\nESSAY\nTHE NEW OUTLAWRY Jacob D. Charles 1195\n& Darrell A.H. Miller\nFrom subtle shifts in the procedural mechanics of self-defense\ndoctrine to substantive expansions of justified lethal force, legislatures\nare delegating larger amounts of “violence work” to the private sphere.\nThese regulatory innovations layer on top of existing rules that broadly\nauthorize private violence—both defensive and offensive—for self\u0002protection and the ostensible maintenance of law and order. Yet such\nsignificant authority for private violence, and the values it projects, can\nhave tragic real-world consequences, especially for marginalized\ncommunities and people of color.\nWe argue that these expansions of private violence tap into an\nancient form of social control—outlawry: the removal of the sovereign’s\nprotection from a person and the empowerment of private violence in\nservice of law enforcement and punishment. Indeed, we argue that\nregulatory innovations in the law of self-defense, defense of property,\nand citizen’s arrest form a species of “New Outlawry” that test\nconstitutional boundaries and raise profound questions about law and\nviolence, private and public action.\nSimultaneously, we use the New Outlawry as a frame to explore\nconnections between several constitutional doctrines heretofore\nconsidered distinct. Whether limits on authorized private violence fall\nunder the state action doctrine, the private nondelegation doctrine, due\nprocess or equal protection, or the republican form of government\nguarantee, experimentation with the New Outlawry provides an\nopportunity to explore how these different doctrinal categories share\ncommon jurisprudential and normative roots in the state’s monopoly\nover legitimate violence.\nSCHOOL OF LAW\nMINOUCHE SHAFIK, PH.D.

The best Palestinian for them is either dead or gone. It’s not that they\nwant to exploit us, or that they need to keep us there in the way of Algeria or South\nAfrica as a subclass.”\n— Edward Said.1\nINTRODUCTION\nLegal theory still lacks an adequate analytical framework to describe\nthe reality of domination and violence in Palestine. The law does not\npossess the language we desperately need to accurately capture the totality\nof Palestinian subjugation. Instead, we resort to a dictionary of misnaming,\none that distorts our understanding of the problem, obfuscates its\ninception, and misplaces its spatial and temporal coordinates. From\noccupation to apartheid and genocide, the most commonly applied legal\nconcepts rely on abstraction and analogy, revealing particular facets of\nsubordination. While these concepts are certainly helpful, they risk distorting\nthe variegated structure behind the Palestinian reality, and their invocation\nhas often muted Palestinian articulations of their own experience.\nThere is a dire need for a new approach. This Article introduces\nthe concept of Nakba to legal discourse to encapsulate the ongoing\nstructure of subjugation in Palestine and derive a legal formulation of\n1. Edward W. Said, The Pen and the Sword 54 (1994).\n2024] NAKBA AS A LEGAL CONCEPT 889\nthe Palestinian condition. Meaning “catastrophe” in Arabic, the term\n“al-Nakba” (ةᚁالنك (is often used—as a proper noun, with a definite\narticle—to refer to the ruinous establishment of Israel in Palestine,2 a\nchronicle of partition, conquest, and ethnic cleansing that forcibly\ndisplaced more than 750,000 Palestinians from their ancestral homes and\ndepopulated hundreds of Palestinian villages between late 1947 and early\n1949.3 But the Palestinian Catastrophe—the Nakba—remains an ongoing\nand unrelenting ordeal, one that has never been resolved but rather\nmanaged.\nThe Nakba has thus undergone a metamorphosis. The mid-twentieth\ncentury mass expulsion of Palestinians from their homes by Zionist\nparamilitary forces, and then by the army of the newly founded Israeli\nstate, transformed the Nakba into a tenacious system of Israeli domination;\na “Nakba regime” grounded in the destruction of Palestinian society and\nthe continuous denial of its right to self-determination. The spectacular\nviolence of conquest, dispossession, and displacement evolved into a\nbrutally sophisticated regime of oppression. Across Israel, the West Bank,\nthe Gaza Strip, Jerusalem, and refugee camps, Palestinians now occupy\ndistinctive and discounted coordinates in a convoluted matrix of law,\nwhereas Jewish Israelis maintain a singular and superior status, regardless\nof territorial divisions.\n2. See Lila Abu-Lughod & Ahmad H. Sa’di, Introduction: The Claims of Memory, in\nNakba: Palestine, 1948, and the Claims of Memory 1, 3 (Ahmad H.

See Ilan Pappé, The 1948 Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine, J. Palestine Stud., Autumn\n2006, at 6, 7. As early as September 1949, the United Nations Conciliation Commission for\nPalestine reported over 710,000 Palestinian refugees, excluding thousands of internally\ndisplaced people. See Conciliation Comm’n for Palestine, Gen. Progress Rep. &\nSupplementary Rep. on Its Fifth Session, Supp. No. 18 at app. 4, ¶ 15, U.N. Doc.\nA/1367/Rev.1 (1951) (“The estimate of the statistical expert, which the Committee believes\nto be as accurate as circumstances permit, indicates that the refugees from Israel-controlled\nterritory amount to approximately 711,000.”); see also Benny Morris, The Birth of the\nPalestinian Refugee Problem Revisited 1 (2004) [hereinafter Morris, Palestinian Refugee\nProblem] (noting that from November 1947 to October 1950 “an estimated 600,000 to\n760,000 Palestinian Arabs departed their homes, moving to other parts of Palestine (i.e., the\nWest Bank and Gaza Strip) or abroad, primarily to Jordan, Syria and Lebanon”).\nHistorian Walid Khalidi’s seminal book All That Remains provided the first compre\u0002hensive documentation of 418 villages that were depopulated and partly or largely destroyed\nin 1948 and its aftermath. All That Remains (Walid Khalidi ed., 1992) [hereinafter Khalidi,\nAll That Remains]. Khalidi’s list of villages excludes, for example, the localities of Bedouin\ncommunities in the Naqab; Khalidi estimates that between 70,000 and 100,000 Bedouin\nrefugees were uprooted. Id. at 582. Salman Abu-Sitta’s compendium The Atlas of Palestine\nidentified over one hundred additional villages, bringing unparalleled detail to the widely\ncited figure of about 530 villages. See Salman H. Abu-Sitta, The Atlas of Palestine, 1917–\n1966, at 106–19 (2010). For a brief etymology of the concept of Nakba and its usages, see\ninfra section III.A.\n890 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 124:887\nPalestinians, meanwhile, have never recovered\n4\nfrom the material and\npsychic reality of the 1948 Nakba: For every household there is a Nakba\nstory, for each refugee a stolen home.\n5 The conditions that the Nakba\n4. The understanding of the Nakba as an ongoing condition precludes an entirely\npost-hoc analysis. Palestinian and other mental health experts have long criticized existing\nframeworks to assess the exposure to trauma in a prolonged reality of political violence and\ndomination. See, e.g., Olivia Goldhill, Palestine’s Head of Mental Health Services Says PTSD\nIs a Western Concept, Quartz ( Jan. 13, 2019), https://qz.com/1521806/palestines-head-of\u0002mental-health-services-says-ptsd-is-a-western-concept [https://perma.cc/6U22-Q8AN]\n(“What is sick, the context or the person? In Palestine, we see many people whose\nsymptoms—unusual emotional reaction or a behaviors—are a normal reaction to a\npathogenic context . . . . There is no ‘post’ because the trauma is repetitive and ongoing\nand continuous.” (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Dr. Samah Jabr, Chair of the\nMental Health Unit at the Palestinian Ministry of Health)); see also Brian K.

Oral history plays a crucial role in understanding the full scope of the Nakba.\nHundreds of Nakba testimonies are accessible online through the databases of the\nPalestinian Oral History Archive at the American University of Beirut and the Zochrot\nCollection of Nakba Testimonies. See Palestinian Oral History Archive, Am. Univ.

See About,\nNakba Archive, https://www.nakba-archive.org/ [https://perma.cc/CQB7-HA55] (last\nvisited Apr. 12, 2024).\nPalestinians have also written important personal accounts of the Nakba. E.g., Fawaz\nTurki, The Disinherited: Journal of a Palestinian Exile (1972); Sami Hadawi, Catastrophe\nOvertakes the Palestinians: Memoirs, Part II, Jerusalem Q., Summer 2014, at 100; Adel\nManna, From Seferberlik to the Nakba: A Personal Account of the Life of Zahra Al-Ja’uniyya,\nJerusalem Q., Spring 2007, at 59. Many of these accounts have also been published in\nEnglish in the Journal of Palestine Studies. See, e.g., Muhammad Hallaj, Recollections of the\nNakba Through a Teenager’s Eyes, J.

See,\ne.g., Nahla Abdo & Nur Masalha, Introduction to An Oral History of the Palestinian Nakba\n1 (Nahla Abdo & Nur Masalha eds., 2019) (using “oral history, personal memories,\nnarratives and interviews to study, analyse and represent the Palestinian Nakba/genocide”);\nNur Masalha, The Palestine Nakba: Decolonising History, Narrating the Subaltern,\n2024] NAKBA AS A LEGAL CONCEPT 891\ncreated have become an infernal feature of Palestinian existence that\nextends from the twentieth into the twenty-first century.

While international law still clusters the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem\nunder the single label of “Occupied Palestinian Territories,” the indefinite reality of occupation\nhas manifested through different Israeli legal designations and governance structures in each of\nthese locales. Although formal annexation took place only in 1980,Israel extended its law to East\nJerusalem immediately after occupying that area in 1967 and designated the Palestinian\nJerusalemite population as residents but not citizens, a disenfranchised, precarious, and\nrevocable legal status.

The concept of “laboratories of oppression” invites\nfurther scrutiny into the functions and profits that each laboratory generates. See Antony\nLoewenstein, The Palestine Laboratory: How Israel Exports the Technology of Occupation\nAround the World 15 (2023) (examining “[h]ow Israel has exported the occupation and\nwhy it’s such an attractive model” and arguing that Palestine has served as a “laboratory for\nmethods of control and separation of populations”); Darryl Li, The Gaza Strip as\nLaboratory: Notes in the Wake of Disengagement, J.

The emergence of a regime premised on legal fragmentation is the result of both\nclassic divide-and-conquer tactics and the lack of an overall Israeli “solution” or “exit\nstrategy” for the Palestinian population that remained in Palestine and came under Israeli\nrule. The intense contradictions that underpin the Israeli desire to acquire the land but not\nits Palestinian population have increasingly produced fragmentation as a structure of\ngovernance. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu encapsulated this logic by asserting\nin 2019 that “whoever wants to prevent a Palestinian state must support Hamas and the\ntransfer of money to Hamas . . . . This is part of our strategy—to divide and distinguish the\nPalestinians in Gaza from the Palestinians in Judea and Samaria [i.e., the occupied West\nBank].” Shaul Arieli, Opinion, HaFalstinim l’o Yevatru al A’za t [The Palestinians Will Not\nGive Up Gaza], Haaretz (Aug. 25, 2022), https://www.haaretz.co.il/opinions/2022-08-\n2024] NAKBA AS A LEGAL CONCEPT 895\nFrom 1948 until the present, the evolution of the Nakba into ongoing\nNakba has resembled the Palestinian present continuous,\n17 an ongoing\nreality characterized by displacement and replacement.\n18 And yet, the\nimbrication of the concept of Nakba in law remains unrecognized and\noften misnamed. This Article brings Nakba to the center of legal analysis,\nconsidering it as an independent legal concept encapsulating a distinctive\ncategory of violence committed against a group.19 To understand\nthe Palestinian condition in law, this Article proposes an approach that\nconsiders Nakba as a legal concept capable of encompassing a pheno\u0002menon that has included genocide, apartheid, and military occupation\nbut remains rooted in historically and analytically distinct foundation,\nstructure, and purpose.\n20\nTo advance this overarching argument, this Article proceeds as\nfollows. Part I traces the origins of Nakba to Zionism—a European political\nideology that pursued the creation of a Jewish state in Palestine—\nand argues that Zionism and Nakba are mutually constitutive. The\nemergence of modern Zionism has not only displaced Palestinians from\nPalestine but also replaced Europe’s “Jewish Question” with the ostensibly\nnon-European “Question of Palestine.” Colonization and expulsion\nconstituted an overarching logic of Zionism, culminating in the reality of\n25/ty-article-opinion/.premium/00000182-d4df-d9c0-a3d3-fcdff75e0000 (on file with the\nColumbia Law Review) (author’s translation). The evolution of this regime has not been\ncomprehensively examined in legal literature, although the concept of fragmentation as\ndomination is often invoked as part of the apartheid analysis. For further discussion on\nfragmentation, see infra section III.B.2.\n17. Much like the present continuous verb tense, it is defined by its ongoing and\npresent nature.\n18. For imagery of pre-1948 Nakba Palestine, see generally Teresa Aranguren & Sandra\nBarrilaro, Against Erasure: A Photographic Memory of Palestine Before the Nakba\n(Haymarket Books 2024) (Róisín Davis & Hugo Rayón Aranguren trans., 2016)\n(documenting, through photographs, pre-1948 Palestinian life); Ariella Azoulay, From\nPalestine to Israel: A Photographic Record of Destruction and State Formation, 1947–1950\n(2011) (“Bringing these photographs together allowed me to create a new archive: a civil\narchive which makes it possible to view the catastrophe they recorded.”); Walid Khalidi,\nBefore Their Diaspora: A Photographic History of the Palestinians, 1876–1948 (2d ed. 1991)\n[hereinafter Khalidi, Before Their Diaspora] (“[A] retrospective glance can also serve a\nconstructive purpose. That is the intent of this book, which it is hoped will shed some light\non the Palestinians as a people in Palestine before their diaspora, and on the genesis and\nevolution of the Palestine problem during its formative phase.”).\n19. This Article uses the term “Nakba” in three distinct ways: “1948 Nakba” to refer to\nthe foundational event(s) of the Palestinian Nakba; “ongoing Nakba” to refer to the\ncontinuous Palestinian reality since 1948; and “Nakba,” without a definite article, to refer\nto the concept of Nakba more broadly, including in law. Since this Article focuses on the\nconcept of Nakba as applied to Palestine, it capitalizes the term in all instances.\n20. The terms “ethnic cleansing” and “settler colonialism” are two additional frameworks\noften invoked to describe the reality of Palestinians. The exclusion of these terms from\nPart II stems from the fact that neither ethnic cleansing nor settler colonialism are\ndoctrinally consolidated or codified legal frameworks. The discussion in the introduction to\nPart II and Part III expands on the placement of settler colonialism and ethnic cleansing in\nthe context of the Nakba.\n896 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 124:887\nNakba. And yet, the very occurrence of the foundational violence of the\nNakba is widely denied, dismissed, downplayed, or excused to salvage the\nideology of Zionism.21 To recognize the legal concept of Nakba, this Article\nfirst identifies Zionism as its ideological counterpart and insists on\nunderstanding Zionism in terms of the Nakba it produced.\nPart II considers three overlapping legal frameworks that have been\nwidely applied to Palestine—occupation, apartheid, and genocide—and\nshows that these frameworks, while useful, remain incapable of capturing\nthe totality of the Palestinian condition.22 The Nakba has encompassed\n21.

The tensions between the universal and\nthe particular is a theme that accompanies this Article and invites further reflections. This\nArticle understands the particularity of the Nakba as reinforcing, rather than undermining,\nuniversal lessons. For the importance of analogy in the case of Palestine, see Masha Gessen,\nIn the Shadow of the Holocaust, New Yorker (Dec. 9, 2023), https://www.newyorker.com/\nnews/the-weekend-essay/in-the-shadow-of-the-holocaust (on file with the Columbia Law\nReview) (arguing that “[f]or the last seventeen years, Gaza has been a hyperdensely\npopulated, impoverished, walled-in compound where only a small fraction of the\n2024] NAKBA AS A LEGAL CONCEPT 897\ndifferent legal concepts in a way that makes it fulfill these legal definitions\nat various junctures, all the while transcending their limits. One key to\nresolving this tension lies in the recognition of Nakba as a distinct legal\nconcept.\nPart III thus moves forward to articulate the form and substance of\nNakba as a legal concept. While the frameworks of apartheid and genocide\nloom over discussions of the Nakba, this Article proposes to distinguish\nbetween these three concepts as different, yet overlapping, modalities of\ncrimes against humanity. Deriving a legal understanding of Nakba from its\njuxtaposition with the most recognizable crimes against groups—genocide\nand apartheid—allows for the synthesis of existing paradigms into a new\nconcept. Part III thus poses three questions: What is the foundational\nviolence of Nakba? What is the structure of Nakba? And what purpose does\nNakba serve? In a nutshell, this Article positions displacement as Nakba’s\nfoundational violence, fragmentation as its structure, and the denial of\nself-determination as its purpose. Taken together, these components\nprovide an initial legal anatomy of the ongoing Nakba and give substance\nto a concept in the making.\nThe conclusion therefore calls for articulating a vision that undoes\nthe Nakba and remedies its persisting abuses. Undoing the Nakba is the\nonly way to transition to a more just and equitable legal and political\nsystem that will safeguard the well-being of all people in the territory\nbetween the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea. This Article\nsuggests five main components as an initial framework toward that end:\nrecognition, return, reparation, redistribution, and reconstitution. Taken\ntogether, these components ultimately mean dismantling the regime of\ndomination and reconstructing an egalitarian political framework (or\nseveral such frameworks) based on a recognition of the Nakba’s historical\nand ongoing injustice; the implementation of the right of return; and a\ncombination of reparations and redistribution as a material remedy to the\npersisting harms of the Nakba.\n* * *\npopulation had the right to leave for even a short amount of time—in other words, a\nghetto”); Eric Levitz, Masha Gessen on Israel, Gaza, and Holocaust Analogies, N.Y.

The intention to defy the Partition Plan long predated the establishment of the\nIsraeli state. In fact, accepting the resolution was simply a veneer to set facts on the ground.\nAs the first Israeli Prime Minister Ben-Gurion himself put it: “We presume that this is only a\ntemporary situation. We will settle first in this place, become a major power, and then find\na way to revoke the partition. . . .

ZIONISM AS NAKBA\nThe year 1948 marks a key moment in the historical genesis of Nakba,\nsignifying the mass displacement and dispossession of Palestinians from\nPalestine and the destruction and looting of Palestinian homes and\nvillages by Zionist paramilitary groups.33 This seismic experience violently\nshattered Palestinian life and restructured Palestinian existence. The 1948\nNakba has not only fragmented the territorial integrity of Palestine,\nconstructing a self-identifying Jewish state on top of over seventy-seven\npercent of its conquered territory, but also ruptured and bifurcated\nPalestinian memory into “before” and “after.”\n34 Put simply, the 1948\nNakba has produced an ongoing Nakba; the first is an event, the latter is a\nstructure and a continuous process.\nStill, the very fact that the 1948 Nakba occurred—namely, the fact that\nZionist paramilitary groups forcibly displaced hundreds of thousands of\nPalestinians from their homes, committed massacres, looted property, and\n32. It is important to note that, while Israel capitalized on the Holocaust to create a\npowerful narrative that monopolizes victimhood to the state, many of the actual victims of\nthe Holocaust have often remained mistreated in and by Israel. See Zahava Solomon, From\nDenial to Recognition: Attitudes Toward Holocaust Survivors From World War II to the\nPresent, 8 J. Traumatic Stress 215, 216 (1995) (“For the first 20 years after the Holocaust,\nthe distress of the survivors went almost totally unacknowledged. . . . [T]he helping\nprofessions . . . engaged in what may be considered dual manifestations of the inability or\nunwillingness to cope with the survivors’ experience: a conspiracy of silence and blaming\nthe victim.”); Yardena Schwartz, How the State of Israel Abuses Holocaust Survivors, Tablet\n( Jan. 25, 2017), https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/israel-middle-east/articles/israel\u0002abuses-holocaust-survivors [https://perma.cc/BWT9-XGPK] (noting that since the end of\nWWII, Germany has paid “about $31 billion . . . to Holocaust victims in Israel,” but that\n“more than 20,000 survivors in Israel had never received the government assistance owed\nto them” and “nearly a third . . . live below the poverty line”); see also Edward Said, The One\nState Solution, N.Y.

This Article uses the phrase “1948 Nakba” to refer to the events between 1947 and\n1949, which have defined the core structure of the ongoing Nakba. It is important to note,\nhowever, that while the year 1948 is a pivotal moment that marked the inception of the term\nas applied to Palestine, the structure of Zionist settler colonization, dispossession, and\ndisplacement long predated the seismic violence of that year. See Areej Sabbagh-Khoury,\nColonizing Palestine: The Zionist Left and the Making of the Palestinian Nakba 15, 83–119\n(2023). By 1948, some seventy Palestinian villages had already been depopulated and\ndispossessed in a process that Professor Areej Sabbagh-Khoury describes as “colonialism by\npurchase.” Id.\n34. See Ahmad Sa’di & Lila Abu-Lughod, Introduction to Nakba: Palestine, supra note\n2, at 3 (“The Nakba has thus become, both in Palestinian memory and history, the\ndemarcation line between two qualitatively opposing periods. After 1948, the lives of the\nPalestinians at the individual, community, and national level were dramatically and\nirreversibly changed.”).\n902 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 124:887\ndestroyed Palestinian localities in the process of establishing a Jewish state\nin Palestine—has often been denied, dismissed, or downplayed.35 Instead,\nmythical accounts of Zionism and the establishment of the state of Israel\nhave emerged to replace these realities in the West.\n36 Under these myth\u0002propagating epistemologies, the Palestinians themselves were the sole\nculprits of the Nakba: Zionism features in these accounts as a national\nmovement that simply brought about the establishment of the State of\nIsrael in response to centuries of Jewish persecution. Under this account,\nIsrael is described as a tiny and premature nation that was bullied by\nneighboring Arab states yet miraculously still emerged triumphant.37\n35. For early works that established this phenomenon of Nakba denial under the\npretext of knowledge production, see generally Jon Kimche & David Kimche, Both Sides of\nthe Hill: Britain and the Palestine War (1960); Netanel Lorch, The Edge of the Sword:\nIsrael’s War of Independence, 1947–1949 (1961); Joseph B. Schechtman, The Arab Refugee\nProblem (1952). A similar line of works extended well into the 1980s and further\nentrenched these misconceptions. Professor Rashid Khalidi refers to Joan Peters’s 1984\nbook From Time Immemorial to exemplify this phenomenon. See Rashid Khalidi, The\nHundred Years’ War on Palestine 11–12 (2020) [hereinafter Khalidi, Hundred Years’ War]\n(“The idea that the Palestinians simply do not exist, or even worse, are the malicious\ninvention of those who wish Israel ill, is supported by such fraudulent books as Joan Peters’s\nFrom Time Immemorial, now universally considered by scholars to be completely without\nmerit.”).\n36. See Avi Shlaim, The Debate About 1948, in The Israel/Palestine Question 150,\n150–51, 164–65 (Ilan Pappé ed., 2005) (summarizing such accounts and noting that they\nare “not history in the proper sense of the word” and “little more than the propaganda of\nthe victors”). Historian Ilan Pappe has described the efforts to combat this rewriting of\nhistory:\n[T]he victims of the ethnic cleansing started reassembling the historical\npicture that the official Israeli narrative of 1948 had done everything to\nconceal and distort. The tale Israeli historiography had concocted spoke\nof a massive ‘voluntary transfer’ of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians\nwho had decided temporarily to leave their homes and villages so as to\nmake way for the invading Arab armies bent on destroying the fledgling\nJewish state. By collecting authentic memories and documents about what\nhad happened to their people, Palestinian historians in the 1970s, Walid\nKhalidi foremost among them, were able to retrieve a significant part of\nthe picture Israel had tried to erase. But they were quickly overshadowed\nby publications such as Dan Kurzman’s Genesis 1948 which appeared in\n1970 and again in 1992 (now with an introduction by one of the executors\nof the ethnic cleansing of Palestine, Yitzhak Rabin, then Israel’s prime\nminister).\nPappe, Ethnic Cleansing, supra note 21, at xiv.\n37. Historian Michael Fischbach describes this narrative as “Nakba denial” and notes\nthat it is premised on four commonly applied arguments. The first argument contends that\n“war is war,” in which “tragic events inevitably occur.” See Michael R. Fischbach, Nakba\nDenial: Israeli Resistance to Palestinian Refugee Reparations, in Time for Reparations 183,\n191–93 ( Jacqueline Bhabha, Margareta Matache & Caroline Elkins eds., 2021) [hereinafter\nFischbach, Nakba Denial]. The second “equates the experience of Palestinian refugees with\nthe experience of Jewish emigrants from Arab countries.” Id. at 193–95. The third rejects\n“any individual or even collective obligations to Palestinians as refugees, or even as persons.”\nId. at 195–97. The fourth refuses any recognition of “‘moral reparations’ or other payments\nor statements that might constitute an admission of responsibility or guilt.” Id. at 197–99.\n2024] NAKBA AS A LEGAL CONCEPT 903\nIf acknowledged as a people at all,38 Palestinians are presented as the\nones to blame for their “free” decision to flee their homes as part of an\notherwise “natural” process of war.\n39 According to more fanciful versions\nof this narrative, Zionists did not commit any systemic expulsions,\nmassacres, looting, or dispossession during the war; in more sober\nversions, these occurrences were simply an ordinary feature of war. That\nPalestinian society was decimated in the process, or that Palestinian refu\u0002gees have since been denied return features in this story is a marginal,\nrather than foundational, issue to Zionism or Israel.40 Instead, the Israeli\nregime is described as a success story through which a liberal democracy\nemerged, a robust economy developed, and the desert finally bloomed.41\n38. This denial of Palestinian peoplehood is encapsulated in former Israeli Prime\nMinister Golda Meir’s infamous statement that “[t]here was no such thing as Palestinians.”\nSee Frank Giles, Golda Meir: ‘Who Can Blame Israel?’, Sunday Times, June 15, 1969, at 12\n(quoting Golda Meir). From Meir’s time to the present, Israeli politicians and other\nsupporters of Zionism have repeatedly denied the existence of the Palestinians as a people.\nIsraeli Minister Bezalel Smotrich, for example, recently declared, “There is no such thing\nas a Palestinian nation. There is no Palestinian history. There is no Palestinian language[.]”\nIsraeli Minister Condemned for Claiming ‘No Such Thing’ as a Palestinian People, The\nGuardian (Mar. 20, 2023), https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/20/israeli\u0002minister-condemned-claiming-no-such-thing-as-a-palestinian-people-bezalel-smotrich\n[https://perma.cc/9U32-PZLA] (internal quotation marks omitted). Knesset Member Anat\nBerko once argued that the lack of the letter “P” in Arabic proves that there is no Palestinian\npeople. Isabel Kershner, No ‘P’ in Arabic Means No Palestine, Israeli Lawmaker Says, N.Y.\nTimes (Feb. 11, 2016), https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/12/world/middleeast/israel\u0002anat-berko-palestine.html (on file with the Columbia Law Review).\n39. To this day, academics continue to produce these misleading and intellectually\ndishonest accounts. Compare, e.g., Efraim Karsh, Palestine Betrayed 2 (2010) (describing\nthe mass expulsion of Palestinians prior to May 1948 as simply “300,000–340,000\n[Palestinians] fleeing their homes”), and Efraim Karsh, Reclaiming a Historical Truth,\nHaaretz ( June 10, 2011), https://www.haaretz.com/2011-06-10/ty-article/reclaiming-a\u0002historical-truth/0000017f-dbff-db22-a17f-ffff2b5d0000 (on file with the Columbia Law\nReview) [hereinafter Karsh, Reclaiming a Historical Truth] (claiming that “the tragedy\nbefalling the Palestinian Arabs in 1948 was exclusively of their own making”), with Walid\nKhalidi, Why Did the Palestinians Leave, Revisited, J. Palestine Stud., Winter 2005, at 42, 46–\n47 (debunking the myth that Arab leaders ordered Palestinians to leave their homes, in part\nby examining radio broadcasts that ordered various Palestinian professionals to “carry on\ntheir work as usual” and “continue their duties”).\n40. See, e.g., Alan Dershowitz, The Case for Israel 5 (2003) (“[N]o one will ever\nknow—or convince his or her opponents—whether most of the Arabs who left Israel were\nchased, left on their own, or experienced some combination of factors that led them to\nmove from one place to another.”); Karsh, Reclaiming a Historical Truth, supra note 39\n(describing “the tragedy befalling the Palestinian Arabs in 1948” as part of a larger “Arab\u0002instigated exodus” scheme). Fischbach explains that this “counternarrative” in which “the\ntragedy of the refugees was not Israel’s fault and that the continued plight of the refugees\ntherefore is a problem for the Arab World and the United Nations, not Israel” is part of the\nbroader phenomenon of Nakba denial. Fischbach, Nakba Denial, supra note 37, at 190–91.\n41. See generally Yael Zerubavel, Desert in the Promised Land (2019) (“In the distinct\n‘spatial code’ that emerged in the Zionist Hebrew culture in Palestine, the ‘desert’ and the\n‘settlement’ constituted key symbolic landscapes, defined by their opposition as well as their\ninterdependence.”); Alan George, “Making the Desert Bloom”: A Myth Examined, J.\nPalestine Stud., Winter 1979, at 88–89 (noting that Zionists’ claims that they “made the\n904 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 124:887\nThese narratives of Nakba denial are still present today throughout the\nmainstream milieus of Western politics and society at large.42 And yet, one\nneed not go to great lengths to set a few facts in place. Palestinian and other\nhistoriographies have produced an enormous body of knowledge about\nPalestine, Zionism, and the Nakba at least since the 1960s.43 In the past few\ndecades, this knowledge has been enriched and expanded on by seminal\nworks documenting the foundational violence of the Nakba;44 explicating\nthe social, political, and economic conditions that predated it;\n45 studying the\npolitical ideology of Zionism that underpinned it;46 and highlighting the\ndesert bloom” minimizes the Nakba, implying that “the country had been an almost\nunpopulated desert before the Zionists’ arrival,” and suggest that “they have a stronger claim to\nsovereignty over the country because they have exploited its agricultural potential more\nefficiently” (internal quotation marks omitted)); see also Meron Benvenisti, Sacred Landscape 2\n(2000) (“As a member of a pioneering youth movement, I myself ‘made the desert bloom’ by\nuprooting the ancient olive trees of al-Bassa [a displaced Palestinian village] to clear the ground\nfor a banana grove, as required by the ‘planned farming’ principles of my kibbutz, Rosh\nHaniqra.”).\n42. As a minister in British Columbia put it, Palestine was a “crappy piece of land with\nnothing on it”: “There were several hundred thousand people but, other than that, it didn’t\nproduce an economy.

The reliance on Israeli archives as the supreme source of knowledge production\nreified the archival power and access of the “New Historians” at the cost of dismissing and\nsuperseding Palestinian oral history. See, e.g., Morris, Palestinian Refugee Problem, supra\nnote 3, at 4 (“I believe in the value of documents. . . . The value of oral testimony about\n1948, if anything, has diminished with the passage of the 20 years since I first researched the\nbirth of the Palestinian refugee problem.”).\n52. The question of whether Palestinians fled their homes because of fear or were\nactively expelled by Zionist forces is one of little importance. An Israeli Intelligence Service\nreport assessed as early as June 30, 1948 that “the impact of ‘Jewish military action’\n906 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 124:887\nprevented from returning to their homes is now indisputable.53 That\nZionist—and later Israeli—forces committed massacres, raped, and looted\nproperty is now an established, incontestable, scholarly fact.54 The\nepistemic closures around the 1948 Nakba have started to form, albeit only\nin certain academic circles.\nThe following sections argue that Zionism must be understood in\nterms of the Nakba it generated. Destructive ideologies mirror the\ncalamities they produce and often become defined from the perspective\nof their victims. Just as Nazi ideology produced the Holocaust and Afrikaner\nnationalism generated apartheid, Zionism similarly birthed the Nakba.\nSection I.A traces Zionism to its European origins and argues that\nZionism is a modern European phenomenon that furnished a national\u0002colonial “solution” to European antisemitism through the colonization of\nPalestine and resettlement of Jews outside of Europe. Section I.B highlights\nthe centrality of colonialism and expulsion to Zionist thought. Far from\nbeing incidental or marginal features, the recurring concepts of colonialism\nand expulsion were central to and constitutive of Zionist political thought.\nZionism adopted settler colonialism as the vehicle for its nation-building\nproject and fashioned expulsion as the solution to the problem posed by\nthe existing Arab-Palestinian population in Palestine. Section I.C proceeds\nto outline the 1948 Nakba as the material manifestation or praxis of\nZionism. Once placed in the context of the Nakba, the other facets of\nZionism assume secondary importance. Put simply, Zionism was a modern\nEuropean phenomenon born out of antisemitism, nationalism, and\ncolonialism, and it is best understood through the prism of the Nakba it\nhas brought about.\nA. From the Jewish Question to the Question of Palestine\nA search for the origins of the Nakba leads to Europe. The\ndisplacement of Palestinians during the 1948 Nakba is the result of a\ndifferent type of displacement: that of Europe’s “Jewish Question” onto\nPalestine. The “Jewish Question” became an increasingly commonplace\nway for Europeans to refer to the status of Jews in Europe throughout the\n(Haganah and Dissidents) on the migration [i.e., displacement of Palestinians] was decisive,\nas some 70% of the residents left their communities and migrated as a result of these\nactions.” Intelligence Service (Arab Section), Migration of Eretz Yisrael Arabs Between\nDecember 1, 1947 and June 1, 1948, https://www.akevot.org.il/wp-content/uploads/2019/\n07/1948ISReport-Eng.pdf [https://perma.cc/N9WL-88L5] (last visited May 5, 2024); see\nalso Benny Morris, The Causes and Character of the Arab Exodus from Palestine: The Israel\nDefence Forces Intelligence Branch Analysis of June 1948, 22 Middle East Stud. 5, 5 (1986)\n(examining the document in detail).\n53.

The process commonly known as “Jewish Emancipation”\n( Jews gaining civil, political, and legal rights) was protracted, nonlinear,\nand geographically variable—indeed, as some argue that “emancipation\ncontinues to the present.”59 For some Jews in western and central Europe,\nnewly won rights and freedoms in the late nineteenth century opened the\ndoor to substantial upward social and economic mobility and accelerated\nthe process of secularization, coupled with the integration and assimi\u0002lation of some Jews in European societies.60 But despite the proclamation\nof equality, the rights of Jews in Europe continued to suffer substantial\nsetbacks and state infringement. Gentile perceptions of Jewish economic\nand racial difference involving the antisemitic stereotypes of control,\ngreed, and dual loyalties became all the more prominent.61\nAt the turn of the century, the Dreyfus affair, wherein a French Jewish\nofficer was falsely charged of treason, encapsulated and symbolized the\npersistence of antisemitism in France, where Jews supposedly enjoyed full\ncivil rights.62 In eastern Europe, where Jewish emancipation was not\nachieved until the 1917 Russian Revolution, most Jewish communities\n55.

At the turn of\nthe century, the Jewish community in Palestine was largely integrated into\nthe local social fabric, which included Muslim, Christian, Jewish, and\nDruze, among other communities. As historian Rashid Khalidi put it: “In\nspite of marked religious distinctions between [the Jewish communities in\nPalestine] and their neighbors, they were not foreigners, nor were they\nEuropeans or settlers: they were, saw themselves, and were seen as Jews\nwho were part of the indigenous Muslim-majority society.”100\nThe coexistence of Jews with other communities in Palestine was not\nan exceptional phenomenon101 but one that reflected the status of Jews\nwho were also Arabs, or Arabs who were also Jewish, across the Arab and\nMuslim world until the mid-twentieth century.102 As Professor Avi Shlaim\n98.

The Zionist leadership not only passively benefited from antisemitism, which\nprovided it with an impetus for Jewish migration to Palestine, but also actively negotiated\nthe Transfer Agreement with the Nazi government, arranging the transfer of 60,000 Jews\nand $100 million to Palestine in return for halting the anti-Nazi boycott of 1933.

On the development and demise of the right to colonial conquest in international\nlaw, see Sharon Korman, The Right of Conquest 41–66 (1996). Lawyer Sharon Korman\nprovides an uncritical account of the legal history of conquest. Korman’s failure to draw any\ncritical insights with regard to conquest becomes clear in her discussion of Israel, in which\nshe skips the question of conquest regarding the 1948 Nakba altogether, simply asserting\nthat “the problem of the future of Palestine was settled by armed force.” Id. at 251. Korman\ncontinues to examine Israel’s annexation of East Jerusalem, guided by the misleading\nassertion that “Israel’s status in East Jerusalem is slightly less problematic than it is in the\nWest Bank.” Id. at 253. In this sense, Korman’s study provides a useful example of\nepistemological inquiries informed by Nakba denialism. See supra note 21 and\naccompanying text. Previous attempts to justify Israel’s conquest during the 1948 Nakba\nhave similarly relied on now irrefutably incorrect facts. See, e.g., Stephen M. Schwebel, What\nWeight to Conquest?, 64 Am. J. Int’l L. 344, 346–47 (1970) (arguing that Israel’s conquest\nin 1948 was justified because Israel was “acting defensively”). But cf. Victor Kattan, From\n918 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 124:887\nZionism did not preclude it from serving simultaneously as a national\nmovement claiming to represent the Jewish people,120 one that capitalized\non a powerful biblical narrative to generate a secularized nation-state.\n121\nIndeed, the words “Jewish” and “colonial” simultaneously defined major\nZionist institutions such as the Jewish Colonial Trust, the Jewish\nColonization Association, and ultimately the Palestine Jewish Colonization\nAssociation established as late as 1924.\n122 Once understood as both a\nnational and colonial movement at once, it becomes easier to understand\nthat these facets of Zionism are not mutually exclusive but rather co\u0002constitutive.123\nZionism treated Palestine’s native population as disposable.

Making\nroom for a Jewish state in Palestine was understood by most schools of\nZionism to require an exclusive Jewish majority in the future territory of\nthe Jewish state.126 Put simply, Zionism worked to implement the notion of\n“maximum territory, minimum Arabs.”\n127 As such, it necessitated in one\nway or another the mass transfer of Palestinians from the land.\n128 Zangwill,\nfor example, at different times suggested an “Arab exodus” that would\ninclude “race redistribution,” which he contended was “literally the only ‘way\nout’ of the difficulty of creating a Jewish State in Palestine.”129 But he also\nrealized that expelling the Palestinian people might be an unviable option\nand pose an existential threat to Zionism, leading him to establish the Jewish\nTerritorial Organization and advocate for a Jewish state elsewhere.\n130\nThree Questions that Make One, in The Arab and Jewish Questions: Geographies of\nEntanglement in Palestine and Beyond 8 (Bashir Bashir & Leila Farsakh eds., 2020)\n(defining the “Arab question” as “what to do with the existence and resistance of the\nindigenous Arab population in Palestine to the Zionist project” and criticizing alternative\ndefinitions that rendered it about “the relations between Jews and Arabs in the country”\n(internal quotation marks omitted)).\n125.

As Zangwill also put it,\nPalestine proper has already its inhabitants. The pashalik of Jerusalem is\nalready twice as thickly populated as the United States, having fifty-two\nsouls to the square mile, and not 25 per cent of them Jews; so we must be\nprepared either to drive out by the sword the tribes in possession as our\nforefather did, or to grapple with the problem of a large alien population,\nmostly Mohammedan and accustomed for centuries to despise us.\nThe East Africa Offer, in Speeches, Articles, and Letters of Israel Zangwill 198, 210 (Maurice\nSimon ed., 1937).\n126.

For Theodor Herzl, Zionism had certainly entailed a process of dispossession and\nremoval of the native population from the land by creating an alliance with a tiny class of native\nlandowners:\nWe shall try to spirit the penniless population across the border by\nprocuring employment for it in the transit countries, while denying it any\nemployment in our own country.\nThe property-owners will come over to our side. Both the process of\nexpropriation and the removal of the poor must be carried out discreetly and\ncircumspectly.\n1, Herzl, Complete Diaries, supra note 73, at 88; see also Ghassan Kanafani, The Revolution of\n1936–1939 in Palestine: Background, Details, and Analysis 6 (Hazem Jamjoum trans., 2023)\n(analyzing this unfulfilled alliance and arguing that “[t]he middle Arab landowners and urban\nbourgeoisie began to feel that Jewish capital was fast encroaching upon their interests”).\n132. For Chaim Weizmann, the president of the World Zionist Organization and first\npresident of Israel, “the native [Palestinian] population was akin to ‘the rocks of Judea, as\nobstaclesthat had to be cleared on a difficult path.’” Masalha,Expulsion ofthe Palestinians,supra\nnote 46, at 17 (quoting Simha Flapan, Zionism and the Palestinians 56 (1979)).

But charter\ncompanies were hard to fashion in 1918, the first quarter of the twentieth\ncentury. The Wilsonian conception of the world certainly would not have\nallowed a charter company. Therefore, we had to create a substitute. This\nsubstitute was the Jewish Agency which had the function of a charter\ncompany, which had the function of a body which would conduct the\ncolonization, immigration, improvement of the land, and do all the work\nwhich a government usually does, without really being a government.\nU.N.

Ben-Gurion endorsed the idea of transfer and stated, “With compulsory transfer we\n[would] have vast areas [for settlement]. . . . I support compulsory transfer. I do not see anything\nimmoral in it.” Masalha, Expulsion of the Palestinians, supra note 46, at 117 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted) (quoting David Ben-Gurion, Protocol of the Jewish Agency Executive Meeting of\n12 June 1938, vol. 28, no. 53, Cent. Zionist Archives, Jerusalem). Ben-Gurion would reiterate in\n1937 that Israel “must expel Arabs and take their places . . . and if we have to use force—not to\ndispossess the Arabs of the Negev and Transjordan, but to guarantee our own right to settle in\nthose places—then we have force at our disposal.” Id. at 65–66. Tom Segev’s biography of Ben\u0002Gurion provides numerous other examples that animate Ben-Gurion’s endorsement of transfer.\nAt one instance, for example, Ben-Gurion declared to the Israeli cabinet, “We have decided to\nhelp [Etzel] cleanse Ramla.” See Segev, A State at Any Cost, supra note 28, at 438.\n2024] NAKBA AS A LEGAL CONCEPT 921\ntoday.\n134 In The Iron Wall, Jabotinsky articulates Zionism as settler\ncolonialism, acknowledging that Palestinians would naturally resist Zionist\ncolonization: “The native populations, civilised or uncivilised, have always\nstubbornly resisted the colonists, irrespective of whether they were civilised\nor savage.”135 For Jabotinsky, therefore, the only path forward is the use of\nforce: “Zionist colonisation must either stop, or else proceed regardless of the\nnative population. Which means that it can proceed and develop only\nunder the protection of a power that is independent of the native\npopulation—behind an iron wall, which the native population cannot\nbreach.”136 This idea of an “iron wall,” namely, employing violence to\nassert a Zionist sovereignty against the will of the native Palestinian\npopulation, has continued to influence the Israeli doctrine of colonization\nand state building until this day.\n137\nAs should be clear from the foregoing,\n138 Zionist leaders have always\narticulated their project as a settler-colonial project involving the transfer\n134.

From Moshe Dayan to Benjamin Netanyahu, the idea that Israel must be\nmaintained by force has been a dominant feature of Israeli politics. As early as 1956, Moshe\nDayan articulated this doctrine in a famous eulogy for an Israeli soldier named Ro’i Rotberg,\nwho was murdered near Gaza:\nLet us not today fling accusations at the murderers. What cause have we\nto complain about their fierce hatred for us? For eight years now, they sit\nin their refugee camps in Gaza, and before their eyes we turn into our\nhomestead the land and villages in which they and their forefathers have\nlived.\nWe should demand [Ro’i’s] blood not from the Arabs of Gaza but\nfrom ourselves. . . . We are a generation of settlers, and without the steel\nhelmet and the gun barrel we will not be able to plant a tree or build a\nhouse.\nSee Avi Shlaim, The Iron Wall: Israel and the Arab World 106–07 (2d ed. 2014) [hereinafter\nShlaim, Iron Wall].\nNetanyahu encapsulated this doctrine by famously stating in 2015 that Israel would\n“forever live by the sword.” See Barak Ravid, Netanyahu: I Don’t Want a Binational State,\nBut We Need to Control All of the Territory for the Foreseeable Future, Haaretz (Oct. 26,\n2015), https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2015-10-26/ty-article/.premium/netanyahu\u0002i-dont-want-a-binational-state-but-we-need-to-control-all-of-the-territory-for-the-foreseeable\u0002future/0000017f-e67d-da9b-a1ff-ee7f93240000 (on file with the Columbia Law Review).\n138. Mohammed El Kurd positions the Palestinian subjects themselves as sources of\nknowledge, contesting the need to cite Zionist articulations to corroborate the Palestinian\nexperience:\nI know I am native to Jerusalem, not because Jabotinsky said so, but\nbecause I am. I know that Zionists have colonized Palestine without the\nneed to cite Herzl. I know this because I live it, because the ruins of\ncountless depopulated villages provide the material evidence of\ncalculated ethnic cleansing. When we as Palestinians speak about this\nongoing and ignored ethnic cleansing—which is inherent to Zionist\nideology, by the way—we are at best passionate and at worst angry and\nhateful.

As early as 1899, former mayor of Jerusalem Yusuf Diya al-Din Pasha al-Khalidi\nnoted in his correspondence with Herzl that “Palestine is an integral part of the Ottoman\nEmpire, and more gravely, it is inhabited by others” and asked that “Palestine be left alone.”\nSee Khalidi, Hundred Years’ War, supra note 35, at 2, 4–5. Palestinians had become\nincreasingly aware of Zionist endeavors, objectives, and goals well before those things\nculminated in the 1948 Nakba. Palestinian figures such as journalists ‘Isa al-‘Isa and Najib\nNassar, who published two influential newspapers—Filastin and al-Karmil, respectively—also\nwarned about the perils of Zionism. See Khalidi, Palestinian Identity, supra note 45, at 119–\n44 (delineating the treatment of Zionism in Arabic press). The organization of the Palestine\nArab Congress from 1919 to 1928 also reflects this growing consciousness. See Farsoun,\nsupra note 45, at 85–87.\n142.

Typically, Zionism is recognized primarily as a\nmovement of Jewish self-determination without attending to its key\nmaterial consequence. The Nakba, which is the material corroboration\nand culmination of the ideals espoused by Zionism, leaves no room for\ndoubt as to Zionism’s key feature. If before 1948 one could still arguably\ndistinguish between Zionism and its commitment to expulsion or consider\nthe tensions between the colonial and national facets of the movement,\nthen after 1948—and certainly since then—this attempt cannot be\nunderstood as anything but an excuse for Zionism and an attempt to\nsalvage Zionism from the atrocities it has committed.148\nTo recognize Zionism as Nakba is to take seriously the magnitude and\nmechanisms of Palestinian displacement as well as to situate that process\nwithin its historical context, namely European antisemitism, the\ndestruction of European Jewry, and the supremacist claims made by\nEuropean Zionists on Palestinian land. The Nakba has emanated from\nZionist praxis and provided an irrefutable material instantiation of Zionist\nideology that must inform how we define it.\n149\npeace agreement . . . . The US-led bilateral agreement reframed the Palestinian freedom\nstruggle from one against Zionist settler-colonial ‘racial elimination’ and territorial\nexpansion to a conflict between two warring peoples.”).\n148. Professor Derek Penslar provides a sophisticated example of the claim that\n“[p]lacing Zionism within the broad sweep of Western colonialism leaves unexplained many\nof its key aspects, such as the nature of Zionism’s connection with historic Palestine.”\nPenslar, Zionism, supra note 58, at 70. Interestingly, while Penslar notes that “[w]hether\nZionism’s particularities or its commonalities with other forms of settlement colonialism are\nmore important is largely a function of the observer’s disciplinary position and political\ncommitments,” he does not disclose to the readers his own viewpoint, given his disciplinary\nposition or political commitments. See id. at 95–96 (describing what he calls “[e]ngaged\nscholarship”). One is left wondering: Is nuance the enemy of a value judgment? What is the\nvalue of nuance if it obfuscates the harms essential to certain ideologies? If Zionism is\ncolonialism—and surely, other things as well—why should we dissect this facet from its other\nmanifestations and exceptionalize it? This broader attempt to sever Zionism from its family\nname—colonialism—or the need to constantly assert that it has other relatives called\n“antisemitism” and “nationalism” remains a puzzling issue. The national and colonial facets\nof Zionism are not contrary but rather co-constitutive. Zionism was born out of their\namalgamation.\n149. And yet some scholars have claimed, for example, that Zionism remains a just or\njustifiable ideology despite the intense moral tensions stemming from its treatment of\nPalestinians. See, e.g., Chaim Gans, A Just Zionism: On the Morality of the Jewish State 5–6\n(2008) (defending the justice of Zionism’s “defining principles,” though acknowledging\nthe “gap between a particular version of Zionist ideology that could be considered just and\nthe situation today”). Benny Morris, a historian who has written extensively about the\nNakba, somehow maintains that Zionist forces’ expulsions of Palestinians are not “war\ncrimes”: “[I]t was necessary to uproot [Palestinians]. There was no choice but to expel that\npopulation. . . . It was necessary to cleanse the villages from which [ Jewish] convoys and\n[ Jewish] settlements were fired on.” Survival of the Fittest (Cont.), Haaretz ( Jan. 8, 2004),\nhttps://www.haaretz.com/2004-01-08/ty-article/survival-of-the-fittest-cont/0000017f-e86d\u0002da9b-a1ff-ec6fb5000000 (on file with the Columbia Law Review) [hereinafter Survival of the\nFittest] (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Benny Morris).\n2024] NAKBA AS A LEGAL CONCEPT 925\nC. Zionism in Praxis\nThe Nakba of 1948, then, is the material manifestation of Zionism.\nThe May 14, 1948 declaration establishing the State of Israel provides a\nuseful temporal mark to distinguish the two main stages of the Nakba. The\nfirst stage, inaugurated by the United Nations’ adoption of the Partition\nPlan,150 unfolded between November 30, 1947, and May 14, 1948. At this\nfirst stage of the Nakba, no neighboring Arab armies intervened, and the\nBritish had still not yet completed their full withdrawal from Palestine.151\nAnd yet, this first stage yielded catastrophic results for the Palestinians\nand put in place a pattern of expulsion and displacement. The United\nNations’ adoption of the Partition Plan sparked a process of intensifying\nviolence between Jews and Arabs in Palestine—violence that increasingly\nAlthough Morris argued that the Nakba is a justifiable case of ethnic cleansing, he later\ncontended that Israel conducted no ethnic cleansing. Compare Survival of the Fittest, supra\n(stating that “[t]here are circumstances in history that justify ethnic cleansing” and that the\nexpulsions were “necessary to cleanse the hinterland and cleanse the border areas and\ncleanse the main roads”) (internal quotation marks omitted), with Benny Morris, Opinion,\nIsrael Conducted No Ethnic Cleansing in 1948, Haaretz (Oct. 10, 2016),\nhttps://www.haaretz.com/opinion/2016-10-10/ty-article/.premium/israel-conducted-no\u0002ethnic-cleansing-in-1948/0000017f-db91-d3a5-af7f-fbbfa2270000 (on file with the Columbia\nLaw Review) (“I don’t accept the definition ‘ethnic cleansing’ for what the Jews in prestate\nIsrael did in 1948.”).

In December 1947, Sir Alan Cunningham,\nthe British High-Commissioner of Palestine, described the nature of this violence: “The\ninitial Arab outbreaks were spontaneous and unorganized and were more demonstrations\nof displeasure . . . than determined attacks on Jews.

The Irgun had 5,000 men and Lehi had\napproximately 1,000 ‘freedom fighters’. The Palestinian Arabs, on the\nother hand, had to rely on the Jaysh al-Jihad al-Muqaddes, which was their\nonly indigenous defence force, numbering 5,000 men, which had no\nmodern weapons, few sources of finance, and fought with weapons\ndiscarded in earlier wars, mostly rifles. The Jaysh al-Inqadh, the so-called\n‘Arab Liberation Army’, numbered between 3,000 and 4,000 men, of\nwhom 1,500 were Palestinian Arab. They were described as being poorly\ntrained both militarily and politically, and lacking the formation necessary\nfor mobilising popular resistance.\nKattan, supra note 119, at 178 (footnotes omitted) (first citing David Gilmour, Dispossessed:\nThe Ordeal of the Palestinians 63 (1982); then citing Rosemary Sayigh, The Palestinians:\nFrom Peasants to Revolutionaries 79 (2d ed. 2007)); see also Pappé, Arab-Israeli Conflict,\nsupra note 49, at 52 (describing the “growth of the Jewish military potential”).\n155.

Common descriptions of 1948 as simply\na war have thus obfuscated and grossly reduced the full meaning of\nthe Nakba, which has never been merely a result of war but was rather\na set of catastrophic transformations imposed by force on Palestine, the\nPalestinian people, and, indeed, the Arab world more broadly. These\ntransformations, captured through the concept of Nakba, are the result of\nZionism in praxis; a national-colonial enterprise that emerged in Europe\nand contained expulsion in its ideological DNA.\nII. NAKBA AND ITS LEGAL OTHERS\nThe terms “occupation,” “apartheid,” and “genocide” have often\nbeen invoked to describe the Palestinian condition from a legal\nstandpoint. And yet, one need not be a scholar of international law to\ngrasp that the word occupation denotes—or at least should denote—\nsituations that are in essence different from apartheid, and that both\nterms, in turn, are distinct from genocide. Palestine is a site of conceptual\ncollision and overlap, where existing frameworks are stretched to the verge\nof collapse. Too often, the legal discourse around Palestine is cacophonous\nand muddled, not least because the violence that is committed against the\nPalestinian people is multifaceted.\nWhat is the most sensible legal category to capture the Palestinian\ncondition? This Article proposes that the answer is all of the above and\nnone at once: Palestine is best understood through the prism of Nakba,\nwhich may fulfill the legal definitions of occupation, apartheid, and\ngenocide at various points while still transcending their confines. In other\nwords, the terms we possess have failed to capture the reality of Palestine\nnot because they are incorrect but because each term highlights only part\nof the story. Adopting the Nakba framework as an overarching legal\nconcept insists on contending with the totality of the Palestinian\ncondition, one that is greater than the sum of its parts. It allows us to fine\u0002tune, synthesize, and locate existing terms within a broader context and\napply them to specific facets of Palestinian subordination.\nAs this Part shows, existing legal frameworks are prone to contest the\nvery core of the Palestinian experience rather than recognize it and\ncircumvent legal questions about the Nakba rather than contend with\nthem. This tension is entrenched in the legal history of Palestine, which is\ncharacterized by successive attempts to quash the Palestinian right to self\u0002183. See supra note 177.\n2024] NAKBA AS A LEGAL CONCEPT 933\ndetermination ever since the inception of the British Mandate.184 It is\nagainst this background that the Palestinian condition must be analyzed\nand formulated in legal terms. A legal conception of Palestine must\naccount for this obstructed process of decolonization. Once the United\nNations adopted the partition scheme and recognized the State of Israel\nin 1949, it effectively reconfigured Zionism from an institutionalized\nsettler movement into a new juridical category—statehood—that\nentrenched the denial of Palestinian self-determination.185 The Nakba\nframework thus insists on examining the legal questions stemming from\nthis order.\nPart III further explores what the imbrication of Nakba in law may\nlook like. But before moving forward, we must consider the limitations of\nthe existing legal concepts. This Part excludes a detailed exploration of\nthe terms ethnic cleansing, colonialism, and settler colonialism. This\ndecision stems from the fact that, at least in a doctrinal sense, these terms\nare not as well consolidated as the categories of occupation, apartheid, or\ngenocide.\n186 As Part III will explore, the concept of Nakba overlaps with\n184. See supra notes 94–97 and accompanying text.\n185. Article 4(1) of the United Nations Charter states that “Membership in the United\nNations is open to all other peace-loving states which accept the obligations contained in the\npresent Charter and, in the judgment of the Organization, are able and willing to carry out\nthese obligations.” U.N. Charter art. 4 ¶ 1 (emphasis added).\nIn 1948, Article 4(1) notwithstanding, the U.S. Representative to the UN Philip Jessup\nmade the case for the admission of Israel as a UN member state, despite the conquest of\nterritories beyond the boundaries of the Partition Plan. Notably, he argued\nWe all know that, historically, many States have begun their existence with\ntheir frontiers unsettled. Let me take as one example, my own country,\nthe United States of America. Like the State of Israel in its origin, it had\ncertain territory along the seacoast. It had various indeterminate claims\nto an extended territory westward. But, in the case of the United States,\nthat land had not even been explored, and no one knew just where the\nAmerican claims ended and where French and British and Spanish claims\nbegan. . . . I maintain that, in the light of history and in the light of the\npractice and acceptance by other States, the existence of the United States\nof America was not in question before its final boundaries were\ndetermined.\nU.N. SCOR, 3d Sess. 383d mtg. at 11, U.N. Doc. S/PV.383 (Dec. 2, 1948).\nIn 2024, the United States vetoed a widely supported resolution to admit Palestine as a\nmember state of the United Nations. The U.S. Representative to the UN Robert Wood\nclaimed that “We also have long been clear that premature actions here in New York, even\nwith the best intentions, will not achieve statehood for the Palestinian people. . . . [I]t will\nonly come from direct negotiations between the parties.” See Robert Wood, Explanation of\nVote at a UN Security Council Meeting on Palestinian Membership, U.S. Mission to UN\n(Apr. 18, 2024), https://usun.usmission.gov/explanation-of-vote-at-a-un-security-council\u0002meeting-on-palestinian-membership/ [https://perma.cc/FC9K-6RT7]; see also infra notes\n412–414 and accompanying text.\n186.

Settler colonialism is a relevant concept, but it includes radically\ndifferent modalities and does not fully capture the variegated structure of\nNakba.188 Furthermore, invoking settler colonialism has reproduced\nexisting divisions about the geographical location of its applicability.189\nThis Article does not articulate the limits of existing frameworks to\nadvocate for relinquishing them. The reality of violence and domination\nin Palestine does not allow us the luxury of abandoning any tool available\nto us in the pursuit of justice and emancipation. Each of these frameworks\nforegrounds a different set of legal questions that are central to the\nPalestinian condition. And yet, the totality of the Palestinian reality can\nonly be captured through the concept of Nakba, which locates these legal\nconcepts in a broader picture that ultimately makes other, and harder,\nquestions more salient.\nA.

This is not to say\nthat ethnic cleansing, colonialism, or settler colonialism are not legal concepts prohibited\nby international law but rather that international law lacks some concrete, codified, and\nwidely accepted legal definition of these terms.\n187. See infra notes 381–382 and accompanying text.\n188. See infra notes 385–387 and accompanying text.\n189. While some invoke settler colonialism to describe the structure of Zionism, others\nhave confined that concept to Israeli policies in the 1967 occupied Palestinian territories.\nSee, e.g., Michael Lynk (Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights in the\nPalestinian Territories Occupied Since 1967), Report of the Special Rapporteur on the\nSituation of Human Rights in the Palestinian Territories Occupied Since 1967, ¶ 38, U.N.\nDoc.

Conversely, Professor Lorenzo Veracini\nhas argued that “Israeli/Zionist settler colonialism was remarkably successful before 1967,\nand was largely unsuccessful thereafter,” leading to the conclusion that “the ‘classic’ model\nof settler colonialism . . . does not apply in the 1967 territories.” Lorenzo Veracini, The\nOther Shift: Settler Colonialism, Israel, and the Occupation, J.

Lisa Hajjar, Courting Conflict: The Israeli Military Court System in the West Bank\nand Gaza 2 (2005) (“Israel’s occupation of the West Bank and Gaza is the longest in modern\nhistory and has taken on many permanent-looking features . . . .”).\n2024] NAKBA AS A LEGAL CONCEPT 935\nlegal framework of occupation illustrates the anomalies that stem from a\ntop-down and noncontextual application of the law. International law only\nrecognizes Israeli occupation to the extent that the 1967 occupation of the\nWest Bank, East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip is concerned.\n191 The\npremise that the Israeli regime of domination is rooted in the occupation\nof the 1967 territories shrinks the law’s purview and misdiagnoses the core\nof the problem. Once the lens of occupation is applied, the totality of the\nPalestinian condition is distorted, and the Nakba is relegated, as if by\namnesia, to a legal limbo.\n192\nThis tension stems from the origins of the legal concept of\noccupation, which developed distinctly from the concepts of conquest and\ncolonization.\n193 Rooted in the material and conceptual transformations in\n191. This is not tantamount to claiming that occupation, as a legal framework, should\nbe extended to apply monolithically to Palestine since 1948. Instead, this Article suggests\nthat we should formulate a legal conception of the Nakba that includes, but is not limited\nto, the Israeli occupation of the 1967 territories.\n192. Israeli legal scholars have produced substantial and influential knowledge on the\nlaw of occupation, taking the Israeli occupation of the 1967 Palestinian territories and the\njurisprudence produced by the Israeli Supreme Court as a focal case study. See, e.g., Eyal\nBenvenisti, The International Law of Occupation 239–48 (2d ed. 2012) [hereinafter\nBenvenisti, International Law of Occupation]; Yoram Dinstein, The International Law of\nBelligerent Occupation 1–8 (2d ed. 2019); David Kretzmer & Yaël Ronen, The Occupation\nof Justice 1–26 (2d ed. 2021); Eliav Lieblich & Eyal Benvenisti, Occupation in International\nLaw 76–77 (2022). Many of these works examine the illegality of the Israeli occupation. Yet\nnone seriously examine the legal questions stemming from the Nakba. Even more critical\naccounts that acknowledge the relevancy of colonialism to Israeli policies stop short of\naddressing the occupation regime within its broader ecosystem or scrutinizing the legality\nof the Nakba. See, e.g., Neve Gordon, Israel’s Occupation, at xix–xx (2008); Aeyal Gross,\nThe Writing on the Wall: Rethinking the International Law of Occupation 10–16 (2017).\nElsewhere, I have argued that this dichotomy is illustrative of the epistemic erasure of the\nNakba constitutive of Israeli legal education. See Rabea Eghbariah, Studentim Aravim\u0002Falastinim Befakultot Yisraeliyot Lemishpatim: Kri’aa Bikortit shel Haḥinukh Hamishpati\nBeYisrael [Arab-Palestinian Students in Israeli Law Schools: A Critical Reading of Legal\nEducation in Israel], 9 Ma’asei Mishpat [Law & Soc.

The\nconcepts of conquest and colonial occupation as applied by European\nnations to non-European peoples were thus initially excluded from the\ndoctrine of belligerent occupation.194\nThe rise of self-determination in the twentieth century reconfigured\nthe legal terrain toward a prohibition on conquest and a universalized\nunderstanding of the law of occupation as part of International\nHumanitarian Law (IHL).195 The denial of a Palestinian right to self\u0002determination and the failure to decolonize Palestine at the end of the\nBritish Mandate, however, resulted in a new reality that escaped the\nexisting legal concepts.\nIsrael’s borders have never been officially and fully defined. Despite\nthis, Israel has extended its sovereignty beyond the demarcated borders of\nthe United Nations (UN) Partition Plan. Recognition of Israel as a\nmember of the UN in 1949, however, effectively sidelined most questions\npertaining to conquest, occupation, annexation, and secession.\n196 The\ninternational community’s reluctance to fully recognize Israeli sovereignty\nover so-called West Jerusalem remains a salient exception to this overall\ntendency to disregard the legal questions stemming from the 1948\nNakba.197\nThe Antinomies of Transformative Occupation, 16 Eur.

In this context, the Hague Regulations define a territory as occupied when “it\nis actually placed under the authority of the hostile army,” Id. at 2306. The law of occupation\nhas developed based on the principles that (1) an occupation is temporary in essence;\n(2) occupation does not yield sovereignty or title over the occupied territory; and (3) the\noccupant’s powers are limited to the task of managing the territory for the benefit of the\noccupied people.

Reflective of this reluctance is the refusal of most states to recognize Jerusalem as\nthe capital of Israel and to relocate their embassies to Jerusalem. The status of Jerusalem\nthus remains a legally unresolved issue under international law. See, e.g., Antonio Cassese,\nLegal Considerations on the International Status of Jerusalem, in The Human Dimension\nof International Law: Selected Papers of Antonio Cassese 290 (Antonio Cassese & Salvatore\nZappalà eds., 2008); Henry Cattan, The Status of Jerusalem Under International Law and\n2024] NAKBA AS A LEGAL CONCEPT 937\nBetween 1948 and 1966, the State of Israel governed the Palestinians\nwho remained in the territories it controlled through a separate military\nrule that in most practical ways resembled a military occupation.198 Yet,\nonly once Israel began to extend its control to rule the West Bank, the\nGaza Strip, East Jerusalem, the Golan Heights, and the Sinai Peninsula,\ndid the international community start to invoke the notion of military\noccupation.\nUN Security Council Resolution 242, requiring “[w]ithdrawal of\nIsrael armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict[,]”199\ncentralized the framework of occupation while sidelining the 1948 Nakba\nand the unresolved legal questions that it produced. The intentionally\nvague terms of the resolution, however, requiring withdrawal “from\nterritories” rather than from “all territories,” allowed Israel, and the United\nStates, to argue that the resolution had simply imposed an obligation to\nwithdraw from some territories but not all of them.\n200 Then–U.S. Secretary\nof State Dean Rusk later commented, “We wanted that to be left a little\nvague and subject to future negotiation because we thought the Israeli\nborder along the West Bank could be ‘rationalized’.”201\nResolution 242 has de facto reformulated the Question of Palestine\ninto a question of occupation within the 1967 territories, envisioning the\ntermination of that occupation through a process of negotiation.\n202 These\nshortcomings of the occupation framework foreground fundamental\nlimits that impair a holistic understanding of the Palestinian reality. Much\nlike the wall that cuts off the West Bank, the application of the occupation\nframework has entrenched a conceptual wall that separates Israel from the\nUnited Nations Resolutions, J. Palestine Stud., Spring 1981, at 3, 4. Even after Israel had\nbeen admitted as a member state, the United Nations still pursued a “corpus separatum” in\nJerusalem. Ben-Gurion declared against this background that “[w]e do not admit for one\nminute that the United Nations will try to take Jerusalem by force from Israel.” See Ben\u0002Gurion, supra note 28. In December 1949, the United Nations still adopted General\nAssembly Resolution 303, deciding that “Jerusalem should be placed under a permanent\ninternational regime.” See G.A.

Once these twin events are conceptually\nsegregated, the legal assessment of the territory takes center stage,\novershadowing both the legal status of the Palestinian people and the\nnature of the Israeli regime. Attempting to apprehend Palestine through\nthe occupation framework obfuscates the legal questions of conquest,\nsecession, the status of Jerusalem, and the crimes committed during the\n1948 Nakba. This limited framework also marginalizes the Palestinian\nrefugees’ right of return, limits the scope of the Palestinian people’s right\nto self-determination, and conceals the continuum of violence that\nextends across both sides of the so-called Green Line.206\nThe issues of conquest, self-determination, and return nevertheless\ncontinue to pose crucial and unresolved legal questions that stem from\n203. Some Israeli jurists have attempted to advance the argument that the law of\noccupation does not apply to the 1967 territories because they do not belong to any\nsovereign state. See, e.g., Yehuda Z. Blum, The Missing Reversioner: Reflections on the\nStatus of Judea and Samaria, 3 Isr. L. Rev. 279, 293 (1968) (“It would seem to follow that, in\na case like the present where the ousted State never was the legitimate sovereign, those rules\nof belligerent occupation directed to safeguarding that sovereign’s reversionary rights have\nno application.”). Meir Shamgar, often considered the legal architect of the Israeli\noccupation, continued to argue that the Fourth Geneva Convention does not apply as a\nmatter of law—in his view, Israel applies it voluntarily as a matter of fact.

See Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied\nPalestinian Territory, Advisory Opinion, 2004 I.C.J. 136, 140, 166–67 ( July 9).

The Israel–South Africa apartheid analogy was invoked as\nearly as the 1960s by no other than Hendrik Verwoerd, the “architect of\napartheid.”219 In 1961, during his tenure as the South African Prime\nMinister, Verwoerd remarked in response to an Israeli UN vote cast against\nSouth Africa that “[t]he Jews took Israel from the Arabs after the Arabs\nhad lived there for a thousand years,” and in light of that, agreed that\n“Israel, like South Africa, is an apartheid state.”220\n216.

While Israel’s relations with South\nAfrica in the 1950s and 1960s were marked by fluctuations and occasional\ntensions,221 the collaboration between the two regimes reached its peak in\nthe 1970s, as Israel nurtured a close security and strategic alliance with the\nApartheid regime.222 Israeli Minister of Defense Ariel Sharon would\nremark after a visit to South Africa in 1981: “I am certain that the relation\u0002ship between us will deepen as we work to ensure the National Defence of\nboth our countries.”223 In the same letter to his South African counterpart,\nSharon authorized “General Raphael Eitan, the Chief of General Staff to\npay a visit to [South Africa].”224 Eitan himself would later assert that\n“Blacks in South Africa want to gain control over the white minority just\nlike Arabs here want to gain control over us.

These divisions\nmanifest on at least three levels: the conceptual understanding of\napartheid, apartheid’s relation to the legal concepts of colonialism and self\u0002determination, and apartheid’s spatiotemporal applicability in Palestine.\nScholars have attempted to elucidate the concept of apartheid by\ndistinguishing between “historical” apartheid and “generic” apartheid.238\nWhile useful, this analytical distinction has often collapsed. An under\u0002standing of Israeli apartheid has inescapably remained an analogy, one\nthat is rooted in and confused with the manifestations of apartheid in\nSouth Africa.\n239 Some have attempted to exploit this analogical trait to\nclaim that the comparison is faulty, often by pointing to the legal status of\nPalestinian citizens of Israel.240\nThe legal understanding of the term “apartheid,” which reflects the\ngeneric understanding of the term, has further embedded in it this tension\nbetween the universal and the particular. The Apartheid Convention, for\nexample, contributes to the confusion by defining the “crime of apartheid”\n238.

A substantial point of contention that remains is apartheid’s\nconnection to the concept of settler colonialism and more specifically,\nthe political ideology of Zionism. A broad coalition of Palestinian human\nrights organizations, for example, have emphasized that apartheid should\nbe understood “as a tool to . . . further entrench Zionist settler\ncolonialisation” and have centered the denial of self-determination in\ntheir analysis of apartheid.244 Distinguished Professor Noura Erakat has\nhighlighted in this context the “dominant tradition among Palestinian\nintellectuals and organizations that have understood Zionism as a settler\u0002colonial project predicated on Palestinian elimination” and has proposed\nthat “Zionism is better understood as a political and intellectual analog of\napartheid in order to emphasize that Israel did not become a discriminatory\nregime but is defined by such discrimination.”245\nNonetheless, the reports of Human Rights Watch and Amnesty\nInternational reveal the extent to which these interconnections between\napartheid, Zionism, and settler colonialism have been largely under\u0002mined. Both organizations have sidelined the related legal questions of\ncolonialism and self-determination in their analyses.246 Human Rights\nWatch claims in this context that its work is “focused on impartially\n241.

Despite taking a similar analytical approach that decouples\napartheid from self-determination, Amnesty International and Human\nRights Watch do not agree on crucial questions such as: Where does the\nsystem of Israeli apartheid exist in space, and when did it start in time?\nWhile Human Rights Watch finds “intent by Israeli authorities to maintain\nsystematic domination by Jewish Israelis over Palestinians” in the entire\nterritory under Israeli control,\n251 it concludes that the crime of apartheid\nis practiced only in the occupied Palestinian territories.252 In contrast,\nAmnesty International goes a step further and concludes that the crime of\napartheid applies to the entire territory, including to the treatment of\nPalestinian citizens in Israel.\n253\n247.

Saying that the apartheid\nframework is limited does not mean that we should relinquish it as a legal\ntool of analysis, just as saying that the apartheid framework has obscured\nthe Nakba does not mean that we cannot attempt to recenter the Nakba\nin our depictions of Israeli apartheid. Nonetheless, the manifestation of\nthe Israeli system of domination has resulted in different “variants” of\napartheid, suggesting that the term’s ability to capture the entirety of the\nPalestinian condition has become too convoluted.255 The best way to\nresolve these tensions is to recognize Nakba as a legal concept, one that\noverlaps with apartheid but does not perfectly match the latter concept’s\noriginal manifestation.256\nThe incoherencies and tensions that the apartheid analysis produces\nare not limited to the disagreement about the spatiotemporal limits of the\nregime but also extend to its relationship with the legal framework of\nmilitary occupation.257 For instance, despite concluding that Israel is\n254. Some Palestinian scholars have articulated a critique of apartheid that leans toward\nrelinquishing the comparison altogether. See, e.g., Saleh Abd al-Jawad, La Ya Saadah . . .\nInnhu Laysa Abartheid! [No, Gentlemen . . .

This tension is reflected in the words of many who employed the term. See, e.g.,\nRussell Tribunal on Palestine, supra note 234, at 21 (noting that the Israeli “discriminatory\nregime manifests in varying intensity and forms against different categories of Palestinians\ndepending on their location”). Former President Jimmy Carter, defending the use of the\nterm “apartheid” to refer to Israel, said:\nApartheid is a word that is an accurate description of what has been going\non in the West Bank, and it’s based on the desire or avarice of a minority\nof Israelis for Palestinian land. It’s not based on racism. . . . [Apartheid]\nis a word that’s a very accurate description of the forced separation within\nthe West Bank of Israelis from Palestinians and the total domination and\noppression of Palestinians by the dominant Israeli military.\nJimmy Carter Defends ‘Peace Not Apartheid’, NPR ( Jan. 25, 2007), https://www.npr.org/\n2007/01/25/7004473/jimmy-carter-defends-peace-not-apartheid [https://perma.cc/\nHDD7-CM2T] (quoting Jimmy Carter); see also Elia Zureik, David Lyon & Yasmeen Abu\u0002Laban, Surveillance and Control in Israel/Palestine 58 (2011) (“While official de jure\napartheid of the South African variety does not exist in Israel, national apartheid on the\nlatent and informal levels . . . is a characteristic feature of Israeli society.” (internal quotation\nmarks omitted) (alteration in original) (quoting Zureik, supra note 128, at 16)).\n256. Even though Nakba has not yet been understood as a legal concept, Palestinian\nhuman rights organizations have already advocated for grounding the apartheid analysis in\nthe ongoing Nakba. See, e.g., Muhareb et al., supra note 244, at 1 (“Since 1948, Palestinians\nhave endured an ongoing Nakba (catastrophe) of . . . domination, foreign occupation,\nannexation, population transfer, and settler colonisation.” (emphasis omitted)).\n257.

[The\norganization’s] focus has been on the Israeli government’s obligations, as\nthe occupying power, under international law, but Amnesty has taken no\nposition on the occupation itself.”258 From this, we learn, the demand to\nend apartheid is not necessarily synonymous with the demand to end\noccupation. The framework of Nakba thus brings into focus different legal\nquestions than apartheid. If apartheid assumes that the demand for justice\nis equality based on the notion of nonracialism, Nakba poses the question\nof liberty as a core component of self-determination, which necessarily\nincludes the immediate termination of the military occupation.\n259 To think\nof the future as one that dismantles the Israeli modalities of apartheid, we\nneed to first name and recognize the entirety of the Palestinian condition:\nthe Nakba.\nC.

Our sensibilities are by now flooded with images\nof massacres and atrocities committed in the name of this or that\ncause. These most gross, barbaric features of warfare, as present\nin modern times as in ancient, remind us also that international\nsociety lacks any consistent means of law enforcement. When it\ncomes to war the attempt to have law without government often\nseems, indeed, like grasping at straws.\n273\nAnd yet the Commission explained that the only hope is to salvage\nthe project of international law by creating “a climate in which public\nopinion insists upon adherence by all states and political movements to\nthe international law relative to war.”274 It thus moved forward to examine\n269.

The conclusions of the Commission’s\nreport and its treatment of the question of genocide are, however, of\nutmost importance since they reveal the tensions embedded in the\ninterpretation of the crime of genocide and the understanding of its legal\nboundaries. The UN Genocide Convention defines genocide as certain\nacts “committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national,\nethnical, racial or religious group.”276 These acts include, but are not\nlimited to: “[k]illing members of the [protected] group” or “[c]ausing\nserious bodily or mental harm to members of the group” or “[d]eliberately\ninflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its\nphysical destruction in whole or in part.”\n277\nIn examining the applicability of genocide to Israeli actions in Sabra\nand Shatila, the Commission members were split about the standard of\nintent required for the crime of genocide; specifically, two members of the\nCommission concluded that genocide “requires a special intent.”278 While\nthe Commission refrained from issuing conclusive recommendations\nabout genocide,\n279 it still included an illuminating “Majority Note on\nGenocide and Ethnocide” in its appendices, where it expanded on the\nCommission’s majority opinion pertaining to the question of genocide.280\nIn this appendix, the Commission’s approach attempts to trace the\nconnections between the massacres in Sabra and Shatila and a broader\nobjective of the Israeli regime it encountered:\nThe massacres that took place at Sabra and Chatila in\nSeptember 1982 can be described as genocidal massacres, and\nthe term ‘complicity in genocide’ is wide enough to establish the\nresponsibility of Israel for these acts. But the denial of nationality\nto Palestinians has resulted in all Palestinian social institutions\nbeing considered to be part of the apparatus of the ‘terrorists of\nthe PLO’. The borderline between [then Israeli Prime Minister]\nMr[.] Begin’s claim to ‘eliminate the PLO’ and the total\ndestruction of the social organisation of the Palestinian people\nin Lebanon is a very narrow one and the constant reference to\n275.

The legal concept of genocide is quite\nconsistent with identifying policies designed to destroy the identity and\nwill of a national group, as well as the Nazi paradigm of the Holocaust.”\n284\nIn fact, the Commission went further to articulate the Palestinian\ncondition as a “particular form of genocide,” one that it considered\nconsistent with Raphael Lemkin’s concept of the term:\n285\nThe particular form of genocide as applied to the Palestinians\ndoes not appear to be aimed at killing the Palestinians in a\nsystematic fashion. It could be argued that if this was the intention,\nmany more could have been killed. The specific form of genocide\nwhich can be said to apply is the adoption of all kinds of measures,\nshort of killing, to destroy the national culture, political autonomy\nand national will in the context of the Palestinian struggle for\nnational liberation and self-determination.286\nThe Commission’s treatment of the applicability of genocide to the\nPalestinian condition at large is illustrative of the challenges that the\ninternational legal community has long faced in framing the Israeli\ninjustices and crimes committed against the Palestinian people. The\ndisagreement about the “correct” interpretation of genocide, and the\nunderlying tensions and anxieties about the confines of our legal\nlanguage, are precisely what led the Commission to ultimately recommend\nthat “a competent international body be designated or established to\n281.

The ongoing Nakba is the continuation of genocide by other\nmeans.\n295 This Article does not argue for broadening the definition of\ngenocide to include the totality of the Nakba, although that line of\nargumentation may be legally plausible.296 Rather, this Article suggests\ndistinguishing between these analytically independent concepts while\nrecognizing their potential overlap. While the ongoing Nakba has involved\nacts of genocide—and most recently what has been called a “textbook case\nof genocide”297—this overlap does not mean that Nakba is synonymous\nwith genocide or that genocide is synonymous with Nakba.\nIII. NAKBA AS A LEGAL CONCEPT\nThe notion of Nakba is absent from law. To generate the language we\nlack, to name the Palestinian condition of domination, and to provide an\nadequate legal framework for the structures of oppression in Palestine, we\nmust recognize and theorize the ongoing Nakba as a legal concept. The\nconcept of Nakba is the most genuine articulation of the Palestinian\n295. The idea of Nakba as genocide by other means reflects both a conceptual and\nhistorical argument. Historically, the Nakba has stemmed out of the repercussions of the\nHolocaust and the collective trauma of the Holocaust has become intertwined with the\ncollective trauma of the Nakba. See Bashir Bashir & Leila Farsakh, Introduction: Three\nQuestions that Make One, in The Arab and Jewish Questions, supra note 124, at 1, 5\n(“Palestinian and Arab writers have found in literature a productive space to unpack the\nimplications of the Holocaust for Palestinian, and Jewish, political rights in Palestine . . .\n[and] the tragic entanglement of the Jewish question and the Holocaust with the question\nof Palestine and the Nakba.”); Bashir Bashir & Amos Goldberg, Introduction: The\nHolocaust and the Nakba: A New Syntax of History, Memory, and Political Thought, in The\nHolocaust and the Nakba, supra note 31, at 2 (“Neither the Holocaust nor the Nakba\nrepresents the totality of Jewish or Palestinian identity in the early twenty-first century;\nhowever, both are central, perhaps even crucial components in the collective identity and\nconsciousness of each of the two peoples.”). Nakba and genocide are tangent concepts.\nFrench philosopher Gilles Deleuze argued in this context that Nakba is “a genocide, but\none in which physical extermination remains subordinated to geographical evacuation . . . .\nPhysical extermination, though it may or may not be entrusted to mercenaries, is most\ncertainly present. But this isn’t a genocide, they say, since it’s not the ‘final goal’ . . . it’s just\none means among others.” Gilles Deleuze, The Grandeur of Yasser Arafat, 20 Discourse at\n30, 31 (1998).\n296.

One quality of Nakba is that it has become an ever\u0002present condition: Nakba continues to unfold as those who experienced\nits foundational violence die, and its trauma is transmitted and reenacted\nacross generations. Once understood as an ongoing process, Nakba brings\ninto view a totality that is greater than the sum of its parts.\nThis Part is an initial attempt toward a legal conceptualization of\nNakba, one that not only locates the Palestinian reality in law but also\nderives law from the Palestinian reality. Part III.A. provides a brief etymology\nof the term “Nakba,” tracing its evolution from a rupture into an enduring\nstructure. Part III.B. goes on to identify three components—foundation,\nstructure, and purpose—that together form a legal anatomy of the\nongoing Nakba.\nA. A Brief Etymology of a Concept\nThe term “Nakba,” meaning “catastrophe,” has been used to signify\nchanging, and often competing, meanings. Nakba has most commonly\nbeen invoked to signify two temporal modes: one that relegates it to the\npast, and one that extends it to the present. In the first instance, the\nNakba—always with a definite article—signifies the manifestations of the\n1948 war on Palestine, the mass dispossession and displacement of\nPalestinians, and the destruction of Palestinian society at large. The\nsecond instance is used to refer to the totality of Palestinian condition of\nsubjugation and domination that spans from 1948 through the present.\nThis Article uses the term “Nakba” in three distinct ways: “1948\nNakba” to refer to the foundational event(s) of the Palestinian Nakba;\n“ongoing Nakba” to refer to the continuous Palestinian reality since 1948;\nand “Nakba,” without a definite article, to introduce a broader concept,\nincluding in law, which may be applied to Palestine and prove useful to\nother contexts as well. A brief exploration of the term “Nakba” shows that\nits meaning has undergone significant transformations over time. While\nthe term has a long and under-researched intellectual history,298 this\n298. One famous invocation of the term “Nakba” is associated with the trial and\nexpulsion of twelfth-century Andalusian philosopher Ibn Rushd (Averroes) from Andalusia\nto Marrakesh. See Ahmad Mahmoud, Nakbat Ibn Rush [The Nakba of Ibn Rush],\nAl-Ahram (Apr. 18, 2016), https://gate.ahram.org.eg/daily/News/151878/59/499539/\n[https://perma.cc/KF3M-CBYP]. Prior to 1948, the term Nakba had been used to refer to\ndifferent types of calamities, ranging from massacres to famine. At least two books from the\nlate nineteenth century and early twentieth century use the word “nakabat” (plural of\nnakba) in their title to refer to the massacres of Christians and Armenians in the late\nnineteenth and early twentieth century. See Shahin Makaryus, Hasr al-Litham ‘an Nakabat\nal-Sham [Disasters of the Levant Revealed] (1895); Is-haq Armaleh, Al-Qousara fi Nakabat\n958 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 124:887\nsection offers a brief etymology of the term as it relates to Palestine.299\nSince 1948, the term “Nakba” has become almost synonymous with the\nPalestinian experience, and as novelist Elias Khoury put it, “when a word\nbecomes an untranslatable proper name, we have to try to understand the\nwisdom of language.”\n300\n1. The Nakba as a Rupture. — The emergence of the word “Nakba”\npoints to an issue broader than the calamity befalling its direct and\nprimary victims, the Palestinian people. Since its association with Palestine,\nthe term “Nakba” has been inextricably related to the fate of the Arab\nnations. The term was first invoked in the context of the Zionist conquest\nof Palestine by the Syrian intellectual Constantine Zurayk, in his book\nMa’na al-Nakba (later translated as The Meaning of the Disaster), published\nduring the summer truce of 1948 and against the background of a decisive\nArab defeat in the war.301\nAs early as 1948, Zurayk realized that the magnitude and ramifications\nof the Zionist conquest of Palestine were unparalleled. Zurayk opens his\nbook by stating:\nThe defeat of the Arabs in Palestine is no simple setback or\nlight, passing evil. It is a disaster in every sense of the word and\none of the harshest of the trials and tribulations with which the\nArabs have been affected throughout their long history—a\nhistory marked by numerous trials and tribulations.\n302\nAnnasara [The Foremost Disasters of Christians] (1919). Notably, writer and editor Shahin\nMakaryus’s book Hasr al-Litham ‘an Nakabat al-Sham opens with a description of the Levant’s\ngeography and describes four major religious communities living in the Levant: Muslims,\nChristians, Jews, and Druze. Makaryus, supra, at 3–8. Makaryus interestingly uses the terms\n“Jews” and “Israelis” interchangeably as early as 1895, writing that the Israeli sect mostly\nresided in the al-Quds’ area and were gradually growing in numbers out of the belief that\nthe land would soon be theirs, especially because they were supported by Jewish figures that\nwould help them purchase lands and build settlements. See id. at 8.\n299. While I am unaware of any scholarship about the concept of Nakba before 1948,\ntwo main articles have studied the concept of Nakba in Arab thought after 1948.

Zurayk, supra note 301, at 2.\n2024] NAKBA AS A LEGAL CONCEPT 959\nThe book, premised on the rejection of Zionism as a settler project in\nPalestine, offers a scathing critique of Arab sociopolitical conditions and\nwarns of the existential crisis facing Arab nationalisms.303 To undo the\nNakba, Zurayk called for a radical reconfiguration of Arab societies, one\nthat is premised on the ideals of science, modernity, and rationality.\n304\nFor Zurayk, the Nakba was at its core an Arab issue unfolding in\nPalestine rather than a Palestinian issue projecting itself onto the Arab\nworld.305 The Nakba, for the Arab consciousness of the time, posed an\nexistential threat both to the territorial continuity of the Arab world and\nthe very idea of Arab nationhood, modernity, and future. As Said writes,\nZurayk understood the Nakba as a “deviation, a veering out of course.”306\nHe articulated the Nakba as a problem of the present, one that had\ndiverted the Arab world from a progressive path into a regressive and\ncatastrophic future.307 Said elaborates:\nThe development of Zurayk’s argument in his book led him, as it\nwas to lead many other writers since 1948, to interpret al-nakba as\na rupture of the most profound sort. . . . So strong was the\ndeflection, or the deviation, from the Arabs’ persistence in time\nup to 1948, that the issue for the Arabs became whether what was\n“natural” to them—their continued national duration in\nhistory—would be possible at all.308\nThis understanding of the Nakba as a Palestinian manifestation of an\nArab tragedy was a common thread among Zurayk’s generation of Arab\n303.

Writing on the Nakba’s effect on the history of the Arab world, Said\nobserved:\n[F]rom the perspective of the past, the Arabs would seem to have swerved\nfrom the path toward national identity, union, and so on; from the\nperspective of the future, the disaster raised the specter of national\nfragmentation or extinction. The paradox is that both of these\nobservations hold, so that at the intersection of past and future stands the\ndisaster, which on the one hand reveals the deviation from what has yet to\nhappen (a unified, collective Arab identity) and on the other reveals the\npossibility of what may happen (Arab extinction as a cultural or national\nunit). The true force then of Zurayk’s book is that it made clear the\nproblem of the present, a problematic site of contemporaneity, occupied\nand blocked from the Arabs. For the Arabs to act knowingly was to create\nthe present, and this was a battle of restoring historical continuity, healing\na rupture, and—most important—forging a historic possibility.\nId.

The Nakba as a Structure. — When Israel defeated the Arab states\nin the 1967 war—an event that became known as the naksa (meaning\nsetback)—various claims about the meaning of Nakba arose in relation to\nthe more recent defeat.\n312 In his book Ma’ana al-Nakba Mujaddadan (The\nMeaning of the Nakba Again), Zurayk contested the term “naksa” and\ninsisted on calling 1967 “a catastrophe [nakba] and not a setback\n[naksa].”\n313 For Zurayk, and many other writers, the 1967 defeat was\nanother Nakba grounded in the 1948 Nakba.314 As Zurayk puts it, the 1967\ndefeat reflected an “old meaning . . . anew.”315\n309. See Anaheed Al-Hardan, Palestinians in Syria: Nakba Memories of Shattered\nCommunities 35 (2016) [hereinafter Al-Hardan, Palestinians in Syria] (explaining that for\nthis generation of intellectuals, the “pan-Arab link remains important and the Nakba cannot\nbe understood outside this context”).\n310. ‘Arif al-‘Arif, for example, published between 1958 and 1960 a six-volume book\ntitled al-Nakba in which he explains his choice of the term:\nHow can I not call it [the book] ‘The Nakba’? We have been afflicted by\ncatastrophe, we the Arabs in general and the Palestinians in particular,\nduring this period of time in a way in which we have not been subjected\nto a catastrophe in centuries and in other periods of time: our homeland\nwas stolen, we were thrown out of our homes, we lost a large number of\nour sons and of our young ones, and in addition to all this, the core of\nour dignity was also afflicted.\nId. at 35 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting ‘Arif al-‘Arif, 1 Al-Nakba: Nakbat Beit\nal-Maqdis wal-Firdaws al-Mafqood bayn ‘amay 1947–1949 [The Nakba: The Nakba of\nJerusalem and the Lost Paradise, 1947–1949], at 3 (1956)).

As Arab fragmentation became all the more entrenched, the Nakba\nbecame all the more Palestinian. It grew to encapsulate the totality of the\nPalestinian experience: an overarching frame that encompasses the\nindividual and collective subjugation of the Palestinian people and can be\ntraced to the constitutive violence of 1948.316\nSaid, for example, articulated the Nakba as an “explosion” that\ncontinues to irrevocably shape the present.317 As he put it elsewhere, “For\nPalestinians, a vast collective feeling of injustice continues to hang over\nour lives with undiminished weight.”318 While Said did not explicitly define\nthe Nakba as both the “explosion” and the continuous process itself,\nothers have started to articulate this notion. The famed Palestinian poet\nMahmoud Darwish wrote, for example, that “the Nakba is an extended\npresent that promises to continue in the future. . . . [W]e continue to live\n[the Nakba] in the here and now.”\n319\nThe conception of the Nakba as an ongoing process has gradually\nemerged as an internal response to the intellectual tradition spanning\n316. Palestinian writer and poet Mohammed El-Kurd encapsulates the collective and\nindividual experiences of the Nakba by writing:\nFor Palestinians, the Nakba is relentless and recurring. It happens in\nthe present tense—and it happens everywhere on the map. Not a corner\nof our geography is spared, not a generation since the 1940s. For my own\nfamily, the Nakba was my grandmother’s experience of expulsion from\nHaifa by the Haganah in 1948—but it was also her cautionary tales\nwarning me of what would inevitably be my fate when army-backed settlers\nwith Brooklyn accents took over half of my home in Sheikh Jarrah in 2009,\ndeclaring my house their own by divine decree. For other families, the\nNakba began when a beloved grandfather was expelled from Jaffa and\nsought refuge in Gaza—where it continues in the rumble of the warplanes\ndropping bombs on overcrowded refugee camps, introducing his\ngrandchildren to their first (or perhaps third or sixth) war. It is their faces\non the posters that are yet to be printed.\nMohammed El-Kurd, Reflections on the 75th Anniversary of a Nakba that Never Ended,\nThe Nation (May 15, 2023), https://www.thenation.com/article/world/reflections-on-the\u000275th-anniversary-the-nakba/ [https://perma.cc/PD46-M59J].\n317.

The\nnotion of the Nakba as an ongoing and repetitive process of loss has predated the usage of\nthe phrase “ongoing Nakba.” See, e.g., Shir Alon, No One to See Here: Genres of\nNeutralization and the Ongoing Nakba, 27 Arab Stud. J. 90, 92 (2019) (charting the use of\nthe term “ongoing Nakba” from its first use in 2001 to ubiquity in 2008).\n962 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 124:887\nfrom Zurayk to Said, and their interpretation of its meaning.\n320 The Nakba\nhas become a sort of suspension in time, a liminal condition that defines\nthe time and space between a romanticized past and a barely imaginable\nfuture.321 In this context, the desire to articulate the Nakba as an\noverarching framework reflected an attempt to theorize the Palestinian\nexperience as a distinctive form of colonialism,322 which may be under\u0002stood in line with the articulations of apartheid as “Colonialism of a\nSpecial Type.”323 Reflective of this understanding is a 2001 address at the\nconference against racism in Durban, South Africa, where Hanan Ashrawi\nstated that the Palestinian people constitute “a nation in captivity held\nhostage to an ongoing Nakba [catastrophe], as the most intricate and\npervasive expression of colonialism, apartheid, racism, and victimization.”\n324\n320. In an intervention that crystalizes this critique, Khoury notes that Zurayk’s analyses\nneglect “the nature of the nakba” and rather understand the Nakba as “a historical event”;\nZurayk’s view does not consider “that the Zionist victory in 1948 was the beginning of the\nprocess and not its end.” Khoury, Rethinking the Nakba, supra note 300, at 250, 256.\n321. Historian Sherene Seikaly argued in this context:\nIn the age of catastrophe, Palestine is a paradigm. It can teach us\nabout our present condition of the permanent temporary: we are all\nunclear about what the future holds. We are all suspended in time with\nno end in sight. We are all uncertain if there is any “normal” to which we\ncan return. For some, this realization is a rupture. For most, violence and\ndispossession are not interruptions. They are markers of the temporal and\nspatial suspension that make up the everyday.\nSee Sherene Seikaly, Nakba in the Age of Catastrophe, Jadaliyya (May 15, 2023),\nhttps://www.jadaliyya.com/Details/45037 [https://perma.cc/4LK2-QVMB] [hereinafter\nSeikaly, Age of Catastrophe].\n322. Since the turn of the century, Palestinian scholars have intensified the study of\nsettler colonialism as it applies to Palestine, situating the Nakba as the distinctive structure\nof settler colonialism in Palestine:\n[V]iewed through the lens of settler colonialism, the Nakba in 1948 is not\nsimply a precondition for the creation of Israel or the outcome of early\nZionist ambitions; the Nakba is not a singular event but is manifested today\nin the continuing subjection of Palestinians by Israelis. In order to move\nforward and create a transformative, liberatory research agenda, it is\nnecessary to analyse Zionism’s structural continuities and the ideology\nthat informs Israeli policies and practices in Israel and toward Palestinians\neverywhere. In other words, while Israel’s tactics have often been\ndescribed as settler colonial, the settler colonial structure underpinning\nthem must be a central object of analysis.\nOmar Jabary Salamanca, Mezna Qato, Kareem Rabie & Sobhi Samour, Past Is Present:\nSettler Colonialism in Palestine, 2 Settler Colonial Stud., no. 1, 2012, at 1, 2 (emphasis\nomitted).\n323.

It is to insist that there\nis no longer a struggle to define it, nor a successful resistance that stands\nin its way. It is to grant it historical and political legitimacy as a fact of life,\nbut also to endow all its subsequent effects as its natural outcome.\nJoseph Massad, Resisting the Nakba, Al-Ahram Wkly.

Scholar Karma Nabulsi, for example, positions the destruction of Palestinian\ncollectivity as the binding force of the ongoing Nakba, noting that “the relentless and\ndynamic nature of the Catastrophe - because it is an ongoing daily Palestinian experience -\nthe current attempts to destroy the Palestinian collectivity today bind this generation\ndirectly to that older one, and bind the exile to the core of the Palestinian body politic.”\nKarma Nabulsi, From Generation to Generation, Ongoing Nakba, al-Majdal, Spring 2006,\nat 12, 14.\nElias Khoury instead asks “[h]ow can we read the nakba today, and what is the place of\nmemory in this reading?” Khoury, Rethinking the Nakba, supra note 300, at 257–58. In this\ncontext, Khoury articulates four pillars of loss that are central to the ongoing Nakba: the\nloss of the land; the loss of the city; the loss of the name; and the loss of the ability to narrate.\nSee id. at 259–60.\nJoseph Massad, in contrast, positions the agency of Palestinians, the subjects of the\nNakba, at the center of its ongoing nature: “To insist that the Nakba is a present continuous\nact of destruction that remains unfinished is to resist acknowledging that its work has been\ncompleted. Palestinian resistance is what accounts for the unfinished work of the Nakba and\nfor its ongoing brutality.” Massad, Resisting the Nakba, supra note 320.\nIlan Pappe posits ethnic cleansing as the defining feature of the ongoing Nakba, so\nmuch so that the Nakba becomes subsumed by ethnic cleansing: “[T]he Nakba continues,\nor more forcefully and accurately, the ethnic cleansing rages on.” Ilan Pappe, Calling a\nSpade a Spade: The 1948 Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine, Ongoing Nakba, al-Majdal, Spring\n2006, at 21, 21.\n326. Rashid Khalidi has argued that “the Nakba can be understood as an ongoing\nprocess,” positioning expulsion as its dominant feature and understanding it as part of “a\ncolonial war waged against the indigenous population, by a variety of parties, to force them\nto relinquish their homeland to another people against their will.” Khalidi, Hundred Years’\nWar, supra note 35, at 9, 75.\nScholar Tareq Baconi has contended that the ongoing Nakba is a “relentless structure\nof colonization” that includes “many microcosms . . . and multiple frontlines” that are “not\njust fragmented geographically” but “also exist on a temporal continuum.” Tareq Baconi,\nSheikh Jarrah: Ethnic Cleansing in Jerusalem, Madamasr ( June 20, 2022),\nhttps://www.madamasr.com/en/2022/06/20/feature/politics/sheikh-jarrah-ethnic\u0002cleansing-in-jerusalem/ [https://perma.cc/VX7B-3TE2].\nEl-Kurd has articulated dispossession as the overarching theme of the ongoing Nakba:\n“For Palestinians, the Nakba is relentless and recurring. . . . The Zionist movement has\nworked to make dispossession a timeless theme of the Palestinian experience . . . .” El-Kurd,\nsupra note 316.\nSeikaly has argued that the Nakba’s “present condition of the permanent temporary”\nholds “an abundance of lessons about persisting in the looped and looping time of the\n964 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 124:887\ntogether, these articulations provide a rich and organic corpus that\ntheorizes the Palestinian condition.\n327 The framework of the ongoing\nNakba is thus an overarching concept that captures the totality of the\nPalestinian experience across time and space, one in which the Nakba\nfeatures not as a rupture but as a structure.328 And yet, the entanglement\nof the Nakba in law has been scarcely theorized. This Article attempts to\nask and provide an initial answer to the question of how we might\nconceptualize the ongoing Nakba in legal terms.\nB. A Legal Anatomy of the Ongoing Nakba\nA legal conceptualization of the ongoing Nakba must encompass the\nNakba’s transformation from rupture to structure. We need to ask: What\nis Nakba’s foundational violence? What is its structure? What purpose has\nit served, and what purpose does it continue to serve? Answering these\nquestions will allow us to give substance to a concept in the making. This\nsection conceptualizes the legal pillars of Nakba by identifying three\nelements—foundation, structure, and purpose—that together form a\ncomprehensive legal framework for understanding the Palestinian\ncondition.\nIn a nutshell, the foundational violence of the 1948 Nakba has not\nonly dispossessed and displaced Palestinians but also fractured Palestinian\nsociety and put in place a new regime that is committed to denying\nPalestinian self-determination in favor of the settler society. The structure\nof this regime overlaps with apartheid and is best defined by the concept\npresent” in which “[w]e are all suspended in time with no end in sight.” Seikaly, Age of\nCatastrophe, supra note 321.\nWriter Rana Issa has written that the “[N]akba is the paradigm of suffering that turned\n[her] . . . aunts and cousins [from Palestinian town Tarshiha] into total strangers” and is\n“not only a paradigmatic shared narrative, but also a concept that is laden with fractured\nexperiences, singular and experientially divisive.” Rana Issa, Nakba, Sumud, Intifada: A\nPersonal Lexicon of Palestinian Loss and Resistance, The Funambulist (Oct. 25, 2023),\nhttps://thefunambulist.net/magazine/redefining-our-terms/nakba-sumud-intifada-a\u0002personal-lexicon-of-palestinian-loss-and-resistance [https://perma.cc/UR7N-6GEK]\n(emphasis omitted).\nErakat has argued that Israel is pursuing “Nakba Peace,” namely “the establishment\nof security achieved through the removal of native Palestinians who, by their very existence\nand refusal to disappear, challenge Zionist settler sovereignty.” Noura Erakat, Inst.\nfor Palestine Stud., Nakba Peace: Israel’s Demand for Exception to the Prohibition\non Genocide 2 (2024), https://www.palestine-studies.org/en/node/1655200\n[https://perma.cc/6QPB-H8AD] [hereinafter Erakat, Nakba Peace].\n327. For a rich study that demonstrates the centrality of the ongoing Nakba framework\nto the third generation of Palestinians after the 1948 Nakba, see generally Zarefa Ali, A\nNarration Without an End: Palestine and the Continuing Nakba (Masters thesis, Birzeit\nUniversity) (Sept. 11, 2012), https://fada.birzeit.edu/bitstream/20.500.11889/1502/\n1/thesis_19022013_102752.pdf [https://perma.cc/5T7K-PMZW].\n328. Additional studies and edited volumes that address the Nakba and its continuity\ninclude: Diana Allan, Voices of the Nakba: A Living History of Palestine (2021) and Abu\u0002Lughod & Sa’di, supra note 2.\n2024] NAKBA AS A LEGAL CONCEPT 965\nof legal fragmentation, namely, the stratification and classification of\nPalestinians into distinctive legal statuses that correspond with different\nforms of violence and divergent degrees of legal privilege.\nThe breakdown of Nakba into foundation, structure, and purpose\nprovides an analytical roadmap for the various legal questions at play. The\nfoundational element allows us to consider the crimes committed during\nthe 1948 Nakba and the unresolved legal questions stemming from the\nestablishment of the State of Israel over Palestinian ruins. The structural\nelement allows us to examine the various forms of domination practiced\nby the Israeli regime that emerged from that violence. The discussion\nabout apartheid is thus located within the structural element of the Nakba.\nThe purpose—denying Palestinians the right to self-determination—\nallows us to reconsider the legal questions pertaining to the denial of\nterritorial integrity and ability to exercise self-determination as a group.\nTaken together, these elements form a legal anatomy of the ongoing\nNakba. More about these elements later.\n329\nWhat form should the Nakba take in law is a separate question. One\nobvious way to articulate Nakba in legal terms is to codify its elements in\nthe form of a convention, such that it is placed on par with other atrocity\ncrimes emerging from major historical calamities, specifically the crimes\nof apartheid and genocide.\nGeneralizing a legal framework based on the Palestinian experience\nmay prove applicable to other contexts as well. Nakba may be thought of\nas an aggregation or continuum of different crimes, some of which are\nrecognized in international law and others which are not. On an abstract\nlevel, Nakba must be able to account for a wide spectrum of injustices,\nincluding indefinite denial of self-determination, illegal and noncon\u0002sensual partitioning of a territory by force, conquest and ethnic cleansing,\ndemographic engineering of a population, denial of refugees’ right of\nreturn, indefinite military occupation, settlement of an occupied territory,\nannexation of an occupied territory, implementation of apartheid, and\nenactment of genocidal violence. On a material level, each act of killing,\nmaiming, imprisoning, shelling, expelling, or otherwise subordinating can\nbe understood as an act of Nakba.\nCriminalization may seem to be a natural byproduct of codifying\nNakba as a legal concept. It is crucial, however, to remember that there is\nmore to law than the act of criminalization.330 In fact, criminal law\n329. See infra section III.B.1.–B.3.\n330. The convention, if adopted, has the potential to not only clarify the legal\nconfigurations that make up the crime of Nakba, but also deal with other legal questions\nsuch as the imposition of third state responsibility, reparations for group crimes, or the\nillegality of indefinite occupation. South Africa, despite adopting a convention that declared\napartheid a crime against humanity, has resorted to a model of transitional justice based on\nTruth and Reconciliation Committees rather than criminal prosecution. See Natasa\nMavronicola & Mattia Pinto, The Hegemony of Penal Accountability: Some Critical\nReflections During (Ongoing) Atrocities, Eur. J. Int’l L.: Talk! (Dec. 15, 2023),\n966 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 124:887\napproaches have often proven ineffective in breaking down political\nstructures of violence and domination.331 The criminalization of Nakba\nmay still be useful insofar as it sets a legal frame of reference, advances an\nunderstanding of the violence at play, recognizes Palestine as its paradigm\ncase, and highlights the international community’s disapprobation of its\npersistence. It is beyond the scope of this Article to articulate a doctrine of\nthe crime of Nakba. Nevertheless, the practice of making new legal\ncategories is not only constructive of legal doctrine but often contributes\nto the formation and development of norms and narrative structures.\n332\nPut simply, there is value in the process of legal recognition itself.\nBefore outlining the elements of Nakba as a legal concept, which are\npotentially instructive in future articulations of doctrine, a few notes on\nthe making of legal categories are due. The guardians of the status quo\nand doctrine may claim that there is no need to recognize the Nakba as a\nlegal concept, cast doubt on its generalizability, or claim that international\nlaw already includes different recognized crimes applicable to the\nPalestinian context. But these traditionalists miss a crucial point: The value\nof developing the Nakba as a legal concept lies not necessarily in the\npotential for its criminalization but in its recognition as a distinctive\nmodality of group domination.\nNaming certain manifestations of violence and oppression and\nassigning them legal meaning lies at the core idea of what law is. In fact,\nthe making of new crimes is not unique to international law. Consider, for\nexample, the recognition of sexual harassment or hate crimes as distinctive\nlegal categories that highlight crucial facets of a behavior which is often\nalready prohibited.333 Underlying this notion is an understanding that\nhttps://www.ejiltalk.org/the-hegemony-of-penal-accountability-some-critical-reflections\u0002during-ongoing-atrocities/ [https://perma.cc/SS6H-VW5Y] (cautioning against\n“[l]imiting the scope of legitimate condemnation to the penal frame and the legal\nprocess”).\n331.

Is it not evidently valid to state that the Nazi\nregime also implemented a regime of apartheid against the Jewish people,\nseparating and concentrating them in confined areas of mass slaughter? Is\nit not also valid to argue that apartheid is a form of genocide?343 It is even\nmore unremarkable to assert that both apartheid and genocide are specific\nforms of crimes against humanity. Nevertheless, the international\ncommunity has recognized the value in assigning distinctive names to\nthese atrocities and distinguishing them analytically under the umbrella of\ncrimes against humanity. The recognition of the abominable character of\nthese systems was not only an act of generating law to regulate the future\nbut also, crucially, an act of generating law to reckon with the present.\nLegal recognition was needed to bring about closure—including\nreparations—to the victims of these systems.\nAgainst this background, this Article contends that Nakba, as\nembodied in the case of Palestine, should be recognized as an indepen\u0002dent modality of crimes against humanity—one that is distinct enough\nfrom both apartheid and genocide to warrant individual recognition,\nwhile overlapping with these legal definitions at various points in time.\nNakba, apartheid, and genocide are not exclusive frameworks that stand\nat odds with each other but rather make certain types of violence more\nsalient in each case.\nThis Article also suggests thinking about genocide, apartheid, and\nNakba as three concepts that together form a triangle of group crimes that\ncorrespond with three distinguishable modalities of settler colonialism’s\n“logic of elimination.”\n344 Recent history has witnessed a range of successful,\nless successful, and failed settler-colonial projects. For instance, the United\nStates or Canada are strikingly different cases from South Africa, which is,\nin turn, different from Palestine, Ireland, or Algeria. The logic of the\nsettler colonists might have been similar, but the manifestation of the\nsettler-colonial project has in effect mutated through its contact with the\ncolonized groups.\nThough settler colonialism has certainly practiced genocidal violence,\nthe term “genocide” remains analytically independent from settler\nwas that crimes against Jews were subsumed within the general Nazi policies of repression\nand persecution.”).\n343.

Foundation. — For each calamity, there is a foundational violence\nat its core. For each system of domination, a distinctive type of pain. The\nterms in our vocabulary are inevitably associated with archetypal cases that\ninform the inception of these concepts. The words and the imagery associated\nwith them thus become signifiers of certain ideas that correspond with a\nfoundational violence defining the core of each concept.\n354\nAs much as “apartheid” is associated with racial segregation in South\nAfrica, the term “genocide” is associated with the annihilation of Jews\nduring the Holocaust. If the imageries of apartheid are those of petty\napartheid, like a “White Area” sign marking the system of racial segregation,\nthe imageries of the Holocaust are those of concentration camps and gas\nchambers, signifying the system of extermination. Clearly, then, the United\nStates, for example, has also enforced a system equivalent to apartheid\nagainst Black people,355 and Germany also committed genocide in Namibia\nagainst the Herero and Nama people in the early twentieth century.\n356 And\n354. The idea of language as a system of signs—namely, sound–image signifiers and\nsignified concepts—is expounded in Ferdinand de Saussure, Nature of the Linguistic Sign,\nin Course in General Linguistics 65 (Roy Harris trans., 1972). This Article draws on de\nSaussure to juxtapose the Nakba, apartheid, and genocide as signifiers of different\nfoundational violence and ideological underpinnings.\n355. For works applying the apartheid frame in the U.S. context, see, e.g., Douglas S.\nMassey & Nancy A. Denton, American Apartheid: Segregation and the Making of the\nUnderclass 15–16 (1993) (“The segregation of American [B]lacks was no historical\naccident . . . . Although America’s apartheid may not be rooted in the legal strictures of its\nSouth African relative, it is no less effective in perpetuating racial inequality . . . .”); Harriet\nA. Washington, Medical Apartheid: The Dark History of Medical Experimentation on Black\nAmericans From Colonial Times to the Present 20 (2006) (“The much bewailed racial\nhealth gap is not a gap, but a chasm wider and deeper than a mass grave. This gulf has riven\nour nation so dramatically that it appears as if we were considering the health profiles of\npeople in two different countries—a medical apartheid.”). Despite the invocation of\napartheid in the American context, the ongoing subjugation of Black people in the United\nStates has often been theorized and understood on its own terms, without neglecting the\ninterconnected nature of transnational systems of oppression.

The Apartheid Convention\n974 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 124:887\nfoundational violence of Nakba? Juxtaposing these terms allows us to\nrefine the meaning of each concept. Reducing these concepts to a unifocal\nunderstanding—that of their signifiers—reveals their distinctive nature,\nand their juxtaposition elucidates their analytical independence.\nIf the endpoint of genocide leaves the entire group exterminated, and\nthat of apartheid leaves the entire group segregated, then the endpoint of the\nNakba leaves the entire group displaced. If genocide dominates by\nannihilation, and apartheid dominates by segregation, then the Nakba\ndominates by displacement. The Arabic words denoting uprooting and\ndisplacement are central to the constitutive pain, humiliation, and experience\nof the 1948 Nakba and its aftermath.362 By its very nature, forced displacement\nimplies dispossessing people from their home, land, and property.\nThe symbols of the Nakba have thus become those of dispossession\nand refugeehood: preserved keys of stolen homes and tent camps of\neternal waiting. Though displacement is the Nakba’s foundational violence,\nthe timeframe that produced the 1948 Nakba still included other grave\nmanifestations of violence, such as massacres, killings, rape, imprison\u0002ment, and torture. Still, these forms are concomitant to the theme of\ndisplacement that defines the constitutive experience of the Nakba.\nInversely, the foundational violence inflicted on the victims of\ngenocide and apartheid reflects a foundational feature of the ideologies\nthat underpin both crimes. As much as the Holocaust was underpinned by\na genocidal Nazi ideology, and apartheid by a segregationist ideology of\nAfrikaner nationalism,363 the Nakba was underpinned by the ideology of\nZionism, taking “transfer” as its “logic of elimination.”364\nsimilarly reflects apartheid’s foundational violence of racial segregation by referring to “the\npolicies and practices of apartheid and similar policies and practices of racial segregation and\ndiscrimination” in both article 1 and article 2. See Convention on the Prevention and\nPunishment of the Crime of Genocide, supra note 276, 78 U.N.T.S. at 280.\n362.

Similarly, one can understand displacement as the Nakba’s principal\nmeans of expansion. Veracini has expanded on Nur Masalha’s concept of transfer and\npositioned it at the center of his characterization of settler colonialism. See Lorenzo\n2024] NAKBA AS A LEGAL CONCEPT 975\nInsights from settler-colonial theory further inform our\nunderstanding of Nakba in this context. Nakba is not a process of\ndisplacement for the sake of displacement but rather a process of\ndisplacement for the sake of replacement. Nakba displaces an existing\ngroup to settle a different one. As Wolfe famously put it, “settler colonizers\ncome to stay: invasion is a structure not an event.”365 The material space—\nthe land, the home, the territory, the place—is thus at the center of this\nprocess (displacement/replacement). Nakba displaces a group and breaks\nup the territorial integrity of their homeland to settle a different group\nand create a new homeland on its ruins.\n366 For Palestinians, however,\ndisplacement has never entailed a full process of assimilation and\nemancipation elsewhere, and the Palestinian struggle for their homeland\npersists.\n367 Displacement has become an indefinite condition of\nmisplacement, one that continues to deny the group their right to self\u0002determination.\nFor now, it is sufficient to ask what the foundational violence means\nfor the purpose of a legal notion of the Nakba. If displacement is Nakba’s\nfoundational violence, then partition, conquest, and ethnic cleansing are\nthe umbrella concepts that allow us to examine the Nakba’s foundational\ncrimes and legal questions.368 While the concepts of partition and\nconquest allow us to assess the legality of both the UN Partition Plan and\nVeracini, Settler Colonialism: A Theoretical Overview 33 (2010). While plausible, this\ninterpretive move broadens the analytical frame of “transfer” at the risk of compromising\nits ability to capture the different dynamics and nuances between different types of transfer.\nSimilarly, one may broaden the idea of “elimination” to encompass a variety of concepts.\nThese broad understandings of elimination or transfer are not only counterintuitive to cases\nwhere elimination or transfer had practically failed but also compromise nuance that allows\nus to better understand the divergence between different settler-colonial settings. See Jasbir\nPuar, The Right to Maim: Debility, Capacity, Disability 144 (2017) (“The understanding of\nmaiming as a specific aim of biopolitics tests the framing of settler colonialism as a project\nof elimination of the indigenous through either genocide or assimilation.”).\n365.

As the Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish put it: “But the Nakba-makers have not\nmanaged to break the will of the Palestinian people or efface their national identity – not\nby displacement, not by massacres, not by the transformation of illusion into reality or by\nthe falsification of history.” Darwish, supra note 319.\n368. Both conquest and ethnic cleansing are unlawful under international law, although\nthey are not defined as crimes under these names. The crimes associated with each concept\nmay vary and include annexation as a form of aggression, forcible transfer as a crime against\nhumanity, and other war crimes. See, e.g., Korman, supra note 119, at 133 (describing how\n“the legal prohibition of the use of force by states . . . has rendered conquest, or the forcible\nacquisition of territory, no longer a valid mode of acquisition of title”); Ethnic Cleansing,\nUN Off. on Genocide Prevention & Resp. to Prot., https://www.un.org/en/genocide\nprevention/ethnic-cleansing.shtml [https://perma.cc/268L-NCPN] (noting that the\nmechanisms used to carry out ethnic cleansing can “constitute crimes against humanity,”\n“can be assimilated to specific war crimes,” and “could also fall within the meaning of the\nGenocide Convention” (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting a UN Commission of\nExperts report)).\n976 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 124:887\nIsrael’s subsequent proclamation of territory in Palestine, the concept of\nethnic cleansing opens the door to consider the systematic depopulation,\nforcible transfer, massacres, and other violations committed against\nPalestinians.\n369\n“Ethnic cleansing,” a term that emerged in popular and legal\nconsciousness in relation to the 1990s atrocities in the former\nYugoslavia,\n370 has often been understood as “rendering an area ethnically\nhomogeneous by using force or intimidation to remove persons of given\ngroups from the area.”371 Although the invocation of ethnic cleansing\nagainst the background of the Yugoslav Wars has often been associated\nwith genocide, it has grown into an analytically independent concept.\n372\nTempting as it is to subscribe to the frame of ethnic cleansing to describe\nthe foundational violence of the Nakba, it is important to note that ethnic\ncleansing does not necessarily include partition or conquest.\n373\nThese distinctions are not a matter of semantics but rather an attempt\nto identify and elucidate the core legal questions that pertain to the\nongoing Palestinian condition.374 The 1948 Nakba was not merely a\n369.

See Esmeir, supra note 362, at 31–32 (“The notion of ethnic cleansing is not\nentirely accurate [in relation to Palestine] because the Palestinian tie to the land, and the\ncollective existence that this tie allows, and not their ethnic belonging or their permanent\ncollective identity, is what reinforces the brutality of settler colonialism against them [the\nPalestinians].” (author’s translation)).\n376.

The formulation of Nakba’s\nfoundational element in law requires an understanding of the concept of\nethnic cleansing in conjunction with that of partition and conquest. This\nnuanced understanding is especially important because the 1948 Nakba\nnot only “cleansed” an ethnonational population from a territory but also\ndivided, conquered, and entirely redefined both the group’s organization\nand the territory’s political and administrative demarcations by force.381\nAlso, “ethnic cleansing” is an accurate term only insofar as the\npositionality of the cleanser—the one performing the act of “cleansing”—\nis concerned. It does not tell us much about what happens to those cleansed\nor what structures of violence they become trapped in. Inversely, as a\nconceptual term, “ethnic cleansing” does not tell us much about what\nhappens to those who are not cleansed, or perhaps not cleansed yet.\nIndeed, the victims and potential victims of ethnic cleansing are reduced\nto the fantasies of their victimizers. Once subjected to ethnic cleansing,\nthey disappear beyond the purview of the paradigm; they cease to exist in\ntime or space and simply become a “refugee problem.”382\nThe ongoing Nakba is premised on a broader anatomy—one that\nincludes conquest, fragmentation, and denial of self-determination—\nalthough its foundational violence overlaps with ethnic cleansing, and\nethnic cleansing is a feature of the structure that underpins the ongoing\nNakba. Once placed within the Nakba’s foundational element, the\nconcepts of partition, conquest, and ethnic cleansing become legible as\npart of a broader framework that includes a structure and purpose.\n2. Structure. — The seismic rupture in the fabric of society following\nthe foundational violence of displacement creates a fracture, one that\nfragments the group into at least two parts: those who remained under the\nnew regime and those who were made refugees. Preventing refugees from\nreturning to their homes is central to stabilizing the new regime, which\ntransforms displacement into a permanent state of exile and maintains the\ndemographic composition to favor the settler society.\n(emphasis omitted)); Quigley, Legality of a Jewish State, supra note 377, at 3–6 (examining\nlegal questions stemming from the British Mandate and the establishment of the State of\nIsrael and noting that “[t]he question of the legality of Israel . . . has persisted”); Ronen,\nSchrödinger’s Occupation, supra note 196, at 146 (examining the application of the law of\noccupation in Jerusalem in 1948–1949 and concluding that “[t]hroughout its existence,\nIsrael’s conduct was characterized by gradual transformations of fortuitous factual situations\ninto claims of entitlement”); Yuval Shany, Legal Entitlements, Changing Circumstances and\nIntertemporality: A Comment On the Creation of Israel and the Status of Palestine, 49 Isr.\nL.

Pappe, Ethnic Cleansing, supra note 36, at 2 (“The end result of such acts is the\ncreation of a refugee problem.”).\n2024] NAKBA AS A LEGAL CONCEPT 979\nCommitting a Nakba, then, does not mean succeeding in displacing\nthe entire group, as much as committing a genocide does not mean the\nfull and absolute annihilation of the entire group. Since the Nakba is not\nonly an event of displacement but an ongoing process of replacement, it\nundergoes a metamorphosis that shapes its foundational violence into a\nstructure of domination. The rise of what may be called a “Nakba regime”\nis thus not contingent upon the displacement of an entire group from\ntheir land, but rather upon the successful conquest of some portion of a\nterritory, the displacement of a sizable portion of the group from that\nterritory, and the erection of a new regime dominated by the settler society\nin that territory. The foundational violence of displacement is thus of\ntransitional character in that it transforms Nakba from an event of\nspectacular violence into a regime of domination.\nBut what defines a Nakba regime? What are the conditions\nexperienced by the group(s) under such a regime? What happens to those\nwho remain, and what happens to those displaced? Theorizing the\nstructure of Nakba must account for the pivotal bifurcation of the group\nand its dispersal across fragmented geographies and legal statuses.\nExamining the removal of the Choctaw Nation, Wolfe concludes that what\ndistinguished “the removing Choctaw from those who stayed behind was\ncollectivity. . . . [T]he Choctaw who stayed became individual proprietors,\neach to his own, of separately allotted fragments of what had previously\nbeen the tribal estate . . . . Without the tribe, though, for all practical\npurposes they were no longer Indians.”383 For Wolfe, the incorporation of\nthose who managed to remain as citizens of the new settler polity\nconstituted elimination by assimilation, or in Wolfe’s terms, “[a] kind of\ndeath.”384\nHere, the Nakba framework stands in tension with the eliminatory\ndeterminism of the settler-colonial paradigm and invites us to think about\nwhat happens when collective elimination by settler-colonial projects—\nwhether through annihilation, displacement, or assimilation—fails.385 We\nmust meditate on this liminal condition between liberation and elimi\u0002nation, because that is precisely where Nakba as an ongoing process lies.\nSince 1948, Palestinians have been fragmented but not eliminated,\nincorporated but not entirely assimilated, occupied but not vanquished,\nbesieged but not defeated.386\nThe ongoing nature of Nakba is premised on the failure to sufficiently\neliminate the group by the combination of methods that include ethnic\n383.

The persistence of the group thus frustrates and disrupts the\nstability of the Nakba regime and yet is also the pretext for its continued\nexistence.\n387 The Nakba regime therefore includes a system of domination,\nwhich may overlap with the crime of apartheid, as a central mode of\ngovernance applicable to those who remained. The military regime\napplied to govern Palestinians who remained in the 1949 armistice\nterritories thus constitutes the genesis of this system, applied to manage\nthe population who survived the 1948 Nakba and became incorporated\ninto the new polity as citizens.388\nAnd yet, what do we call the crime committed against those displaced\nbeyond the territorial purview of the regime? How do we understand the\ninjustice committed against those still languishing in refugee camps over\nseventy-five years later? Here, the analytical divergence of the Nakba\nregime from apartheid becomes clearer. The concept of “apartheid”\npresupposes a political community existing within a territorial unit that\nthe system of racial segregation subjugates.389 In contrast, the Nakba\nregime is one that is constituted by the exclusion of a group from the\nterritorial terrain altogether. The permanent exclusion of those ousted\nfrom the territory provides a crucial reminder that Nakba is not only a\nregime of domination against those remaining in the territory but also a\nregime of subjugation by exclusion from the territory.\nThe aggregation of these internal and external counterparts\nconstitutes the structure of a Nakba regime. Nakba may institute and\nstabilize a structure that is tantamount to the crime of apartheid, but its\ngenesis remains rooted in the fragmentation of the group and the\nexclusion of people from the territory. As much as the 1948 Nakba\nfragmented the group through expulsion and imposed apartheidist\npolicies against the Palestinians who became citizens of Israel, the 1967\nIsraeli occupation replicated this pattern of Nakba and apartheid, albeit\non a different scale and in another form.390 The structure of Nakba is\n387. See Erakat, Nakba Peace, supra note 326, at 6 (introducing the framework of\n“Nakba peace”).\n388. For a description of the military rule in the armistice territories, see supra note 9\nand accompanying text.\n389. Dubow’s study highlights the emergence of South African apartheid from the\nsegregationist policies in the first half of the twentieth century. See Dubow, supra note 363,\nat 1. Dubow writes, for example, that in this context, “[t]he adoption of segregation as a\nnational political programme represented an attempt to systematise relations of authority\nand domination in a heterogenous society which had only recently been conquered and\nunified into a single state.” Id. In contrast, the Nakba had broken up the British Mandate’s\nadministrative unit, partitioned the territory, and furnished Zionism as the regime’s\nnational program. See supra text accompanying notes 33–41.\n390. This time, the foundational violence of Nakba extended not only to Palestinian\nterritories but also to Syrian and Egyptian ones, having an especially devastating impact on\nthose who used to live in the now-annexed Syrian Golan Heights. See Amnesty Int’l,\nApartheid Against Palestinians, supra note 235, at 37 n.3 (describing the occupation of the\n2024] NAKBA AS A LEGAL CONCEPT 981\ntherefore best understood through the lens of fragmentation, namely, the\nmodes of domination that Nakba has applied across time for each\nsubgroup that it has produced. The Nakba regime is the totality of these\nmodes of domination, each forming a laboratory of oppression.\n391\nNakba thus does not eliminate the group but dramatically alters its\norganization. If the settler-colonial structure is premised on elimination,\nand the apartheid structure on racial segregation, Nakba’s structure\nis premised on fragmentation.392 The foundational violence of Nakba\nfragments the group and radically rearranges the previous ordering of\nsociety, creating a matrix of converging and diverging logics, whereas\ndispossession and ethnic cleansing continue to feature as a central\ntheme.393\nThe structure of fragmentation simultaneously asserts the dominance\nand unity of a new group that settles on the territory and establishes a new\npolitical regime.394 It is in this sense that the groups may still be\ndistinguished as native and settler, indicating their political positions in a\nGolan Heights). The displacement of populations during the 1967 occupation has further\nreplicated the bifurcation between those who remained and those displaced, and once again\napplied a militarily enforced apartheid solution to the population that remained in the\noccupied territories. Id. Considering this structure in conjunction with the 1948 Nakba\nyields four different groups: (1) those displaced in 1948 and displaced in 1967; (2) those\ndisplaced in 1948 but remained in 1967; (3) those who remained in 1948 but displaced in\n1967; and (4) those who remained in both 1948 and 1967. Those displaced in 1948 and\noccupied in 1967 have experienced two overlapping modes of domination: the ongoing\nexclusion from the territories occupied in 1948, and the extension of a militarily\nadministered apartheid system to govern them in 1967.

The settler/native divide, however, is insufficient as a\nframework for the legal positionality of the natives under a system of\nfragmentation.395 Once we recognize a Nakba regime, we can enhance our\nunderstanding of its structure and map the fragmentation it generates.\nFragmentation is instilled by exclusion and structured by law: drawing\nand enforcing boundaries—visible and invisible, material and legal—\nbetween territories and people. In Palestine, this structure has developed\ninto a sophisticated legal regime that stratifies and classifies Palestinians\nunder Israeli rule into different legal statuses, subjecting each subgroup\nto distinctive types of violence and differential access to fundamental\nrights.396 Following the 1948 Nakba, the Palestinian collectivity was not\nonly divided into those who remained and those who were displaced; the\nremaining group was trifurcated into territories that fell under Israeli,\nJordanian, and Egyptian control.397 Once considered against this\nbackground, it becomes clearer that apartheid overlaps with the Nakba\nregime but can hardly encompass its inception.398\nCounterintuitively, perhaps, the 1967 Israeli occupation of the West\nBank, the Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem have brought about a peculiar\ncondition of impaired unity by consolidating the entirety of historic\nPalestine under some form of Israeli control.\n399 Nevertheless, the\n395.

Mamdani invites\nus to reflect about this structure and asserts the lack of language to talk about it: “There is\nno single and universally accepted political terminology to identify these three groups—one\nexpelled, one incorporated, one colonized and occupied.” Id. Mamdani explains:\nThe creation of the state of Israel in 1948 began a process that\nfractured the Palestinian people into three groups who have taken\ndecades to recognize their collective interest in contesting the Israeli\nregime. One of these groups became refugees outside historical Palestine.\nThe second comprised those who remained within the borders of the new\nstate of Israel and became its second-class citizens. The third group,\nresidents of the West Bank and Gaza, became citizens of Jordan and Egypt\nin 1948. In 1967 they were colonized by Israel and have lived under\noccupation ever since.\nId. While Mamdani observes this structure, his project is primarily concerned with\ntranscending it toward a “nonnational state.” This objective makes Mamdani skip the\nquestion of fragmentation too swiftly.

Klein’s\nclassifications, however, confuse legal fragmentation with strictly territorial fragmentation.\nWhile there is a strong correlation between the legal status assigned to individuals and the\nspecific territorial fragment involved, this correlation does not imply synonymy.\n403. From the outset, the category of “Israeliness” is not a meaningful unit of legal\nanalysis since it is not recognized as a nationality even under Israeli law. See Masri, supra\nnote 10, at 57–58. Israeli citizenship relies on a bifurcated structure that distinguishes\nnationality from citizenship. See id.; Tawil-Souri, supra note 402, at 159–60 (describing\ndifferences in official identification cards based on nationality and citizenship). Though\nboth the Jewish and Palestinian communities in Israel are citizens of the state, they still hold\nlegally distinguished nationalities. In CivA 8573/08 Ornan v. Ministry of the Interior, the\nIsraeli Supreme Court reaffirmed its 1972 precedent Tamrin v. State of Israel, which held\n984 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 124:887\nPalestinian residents of the West Bank; Palestinian residents of the Gaza\nStrip; and Palestinian refugees (a category that contains various fragments\nitself).404\nA comprehensive exploration of the legalities of this structure in\nPalestine remains beyond the scope of this Article, particularly since the\nabove categories may still contain further fragmentation.\n405 What is\nnotable is not only that they provide a structure to the ongoing Nakba but\nthat this structure is primarily a legal one. Central to the principle of\nfragmentation are limitations on upward legal mobility and legal\nrestrictions on family life.406 The structure is made and enforced by the\nconstant classification of people and limitation of their upward mobility\nbetween legal classes.407\nThe Nakba regime is therefore best defined by its structure of\nfragmentation rather than by a singular form of violence it practices.\nFragmentation brings into focus questions about not only the interplay\nbetween existing and changing legal statuses but also the ways in which\nthese legalities influence processes of subjective and collective identity\nformation. Since the 1948 Nakba, Palestinian collective existence has\ncontinuously developed in this liminal space between unity and fragmen\u0002tation.408 Unity and fragmentation have not been static modes of collective\nexistence but rather dialectical forces that forged Palestinian identity and\nthat the self-description “Israeli” cannot be used in lieu of “Jewish” for the purposes of the\npopulation registry. See CivA 8573/08 Ornan v. Ministry of the Interior, 2013 Isr. L. Rep.\n571, 599–600, 619, aff’g CivA 630/70 Tamrin v. State of Israel, 26(1) PD 197 (1972) (Isr.).\nIn 2013, the Ornan Court held that the petitioners had failed to show that an “Israeli nation”\nthat is distinct from the “Jewish nation” has formed in Israel since its earlier decision. Id. at\n600, 604–05. For literature that explicates the legal status of Palestinian citizens of Israel, see\nsupra note 10.\n404. See Tawil-Souri, supra note 402, at 155–60.\n405. Consider, for example, the fragmentation of the population across areas A, B, and\nC in the occupied West Bank as part of the 1995 Oslo II Accord; the fragmentation of the\npopulation of Gaza into north and south after the genocidal war; or the differentiated status\nof the refugee communities across Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Gaza, the West Bank, and other\nlocales.\n406.

Even in the relatively rare cases in which Palestinian residents of Jerusalem apply\nfor Israeli citizenship, Israel rejects the overwhelming majority of those requests for a variety\nof reasons, including social media posts “in memory of the Nakba.” See Nir Hasson, East\nJerusalem Resident Could Be Denied Citizenship Due to Posts Critical of Israel, Haaretz\n( Jan. 18, 2024), https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-01-18/ty-article/.premium/\neast-jerusalem-resident-could-be-denied-citizenship-due-to-posts-critical-of-israel/0000018d\u00021cf9-db77-ad9f-dffb40820000 (on file with the Columbia Law Review).\n408. See Khalidi, Palestinian Identity, supra note 45, at 194 (“For in spite of their\ndispersion and fragmentation among several new successor states and forms of refugee\nstatus, what the Palestinians now shared was far greater than what separated them; all had\nbeen dispossessed, none were masters of their own fate . . . .”).\n2024] NAKBA AS A LEGAL CONCEPT 985\nnationalism itself.409 It is true that fragmentation operates as a tool of\nintense domination under which Palestinians exist. But it is not only that:\nFragmentation creates a collective consciousness that revolves around\ndispersion. Fragmentation becomes the shared collective experience that\ncauses Palestinians to gravitate toward one another while simultaneously\nkeeping them apart.410\nThe fragmented and multifocal nature of the ongoing Nakba is what\nmakes it difficult to reduce to a monolithic framework. While one can\nexplicate the nature of violence practiced against each fragment, the\ntotality of this experience can only be captured through the concept of\nfragmentation itself. Recognizing the Nakba allows us to assemble the\n409. Reflecting on this trajectory against the backdrop of the then-ongoing Oslo\nnegotiations, Khalidi concludes his 1996 book Palestinian Identity by wondering how this\ntension between unity and fragmentation would unfold across the Green Line should the\nOslo Accords materialize. Khalidi leaves the readers with an open-ended question about\nhow different groups of Palestinians will continue to relate to each other despite their\nradically different lived experiences:\nHow will [Palestinian citizens of Israel] relate to their fellow-Palestinians\nin the West Bank and Gaza Strip once the final arrangements have been\nsorted out, and one lot are on one side of a final frontier and another on\nthe other? One segment of Palestinians study Hebrew literature and\nJewish history in school, carry Israeli passports and vote in Israeli\nelections; members of another are learning Arabic literature and\nPalestinian history, carry a bewildering array of travel documents or none\nat all, plus a new Palestinian passport whose value has yet to be tested, and\nvoted in a Palestinian election. Yet both identify with the same national\nsymbols . . . and both groups regard themselves and each other as\nPalestinians.\nId. at 207.\nMore than a decade later, Khalidi observes that a “new and deadly danger faces\nPalestinian identity today, one that was only dimly visible in the early to mid-1990s. This is\nthe dual danger of the fragmentation of the remainder of the Palestinian homeland and of\nthe unity of the Palestinian national movement.” Id. at xxxii. According to Khalidi, this\ngrowing fragmentation involves not only “potentially lasting physical divisions between and\nwithin what remains of the imagined homeland of the would-be Palestinian state” but also\n“the profound and growing chasm between the two Palestinian ‘Authorities’: those of Fateh\nand Hamas.” Id.\n410. Compare Benedict Anderson, Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origins\nand Spread of Nationalism 5–7 (rev. ed. 2006) (positing a definition of “nation” as “an\nimagined political community,” one that is “imagined as both inherently limited and\nsovereign”), with Louis Hartz, The Founding of New Societies 11–12 (1964) (“Being part of\na whole is psychologically tolerable, but being merely a part, isolated from a whole, is not.\nIt is obvious that there is a major problem of self-definition inherent in the process of\nfragmentation. . . . [N]ew generations emerge within the fragment to whom it is, in sober\ntruth, a ‘nation.’”). The notion of fragmented nationalism may appear to stand at odds with\ncertain currents of postcolonial literature that defend the “fragments” in the face of the\ntotalizing nation. See Partha Chatterjee, The Nation and Its Fragments: Colonial and\nPostcolonial Histories 11–13 (1993) (identifying “numerous fragmented resistances to [the]\nnormalizing project” of “nationalist modernity” and urging that explicating these\n“fragment[s]” can allow for the imagining of “new forms of the modern community . . .\n[and] state”).\n986 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 124:887\nfragments by naming and codifying a variety of conditions into one legal\nframework. The permanence of fragmentation itself is the structural\nabstraction of the ongoing Nakba.\n3. Purpose. — What purpose has the Nakba served, and what purpose\ndoes it continue to serve? For Zionism, the 1948 Nakba meant achieving\nthe goal of national sovereignty in the form of a Jewish state in Palestine,\nand it is thus commonly referred to as the War of Independence. Clearly,\nthis conception is correct only insofar as Zionist national aspirations are\nconcerned. The flipside of this account, one that considers the Palestinian\npeople, is that Zionist sovereignty has been committed to—and could only\nbe achieved through—suppressing Palestinian self-determination. To\nmake room for an exclusively Jewish state, Palestinians had to be\nminoritized and denied territorial integrity in Palestine, undermining a\ncornerstone of self-determination.\nFrom the Balfour Declaration onwards, the legal order that the\nLeague of Nations had imposed on Palestine served to sideline and deny\nPalestinian self-determination in favor of Zionist aspirations. As Balfour\nhimself noted:\n[I]n Palestine we do not propose even to go through the form of\nconsulting the wishes of the present inhabitants of the\ncountry. . . . The four Great Powers are committed to Zionism.\nAnd Zionism, be it right or wrong, good or bad, is rooted in age\u0002long traditions, in present needs, in future hopes, of far\nprofounder import than the desires and prejudices of the\n700,000 Arabs who now inhabit that ancient land.411\nPalestine had thus been exceptionalized from other cases of colonial\ndomination and treated as sui generis. The notion of partition, which the\nUN fashioned as a solution to terminate the British Mandate, further\nimposed an undemocratic regime on the Palestinian people412—one that\nran counter to the very idea of self-determination.\n413 The UN Partition\n411.

The Israeli\nregime has not only displaced and dispossessed the majority of\nPalestinians, but in doing so has entrenched a legal and material reality\nthat denied Palestinian people the right to exercise their political will as a\ngroup. The purpose of Nakba must therefore be understood as the denial\nof a group their inalienable right to self-determination both within the\nterritorial unit and beyond it.\nThe question has therefore never been whether, but rather to what\nextent, and by what means, Palestinian self-determination was to be\ncurtailed. Top Zionist leaders in the years leading up to the 1948 Nakba\nadopted “transfer” as the primary “solution” to what they understood as\nthe “Arab question.”417 The execution of that “solution” produced a\nmodified version of the question, that of the “refugee problem,” which\nIsrael has since dealt with in the form of denying return.418 Displacement\nand denial of return were therefore the cornerstones of preventing\nPalestinian self-determination in order to stabilize Zionist sovereignty\nwithin the 1949 armistice borders.\nBut the extent and means by which Israel has suppressed Palestinian\nself-determination have shifted over time, ultimately reformulating the\nquestion from the displacement and conquest of 1948, to the 1967 Israeli\noccupation of the Palestinian territories.419 Although the question of\nPalestinian refugees has never been resolved, the assertion of the military\noccupation of the 1967 territories, the settlement of these territories with\nIsraeli-Jews, and the extension of a militarily administered apartheid\nregime have become the new and central forms in which Israel has denied\nPalestinian self-determination.\nThe Oslo Accords that established the Palestinian Authority under the\npretext of “self-government” in the 1990s have by design prevented\nPalestinian self-determination and entrenched a reality of “indefinite\noccupation, statelessness, and deep fragmentation for Palestinians.”\n420\nOnce again, the ongoing Nakba has undergone a metamorphosis that has\ncomplicated its institutional structure but has maintained its purpose: the\ndenial of Palestinian self-determination.\n417.

Seth Anziska, Preventing Palestine: A Political History From Camp David to Oslo\n4–5 (2018).\n2024] NAKBA AS A LEGAL CONCEPT 989\nCONCLUSION\n“South Africa has recognized the ongoing Nakba of the Palestinian people\nthrough Israel’s colonization since 1948, which has systematically and forcibly\ndispossessed, displaced, and fragmented the Palestinian people, deliberately denying\nthem their internationally recognized, inalienable right to self-determination, and\ntheir internationally recognized right of return as refugees to their towns and\nvillages, in what is now the State of Israel.”\n— Vusimuzi Madonsela.\n421\nThe Palestinian ordeal of ongoing Nakba continues. Over a hundred\nyears since the Balfour Declaration, the West continues to uphold Zionism\nas its political compass in Palestine, indulging Israel with unconditional\nmaterial and moral support at the direct expense of Palestinian lands and\nlives. Palestine thus continues to pose a pressing question to the world,\nexposing Western hypocrisy, uncovering global hierarchies, and elucidating\nthe colonial conditions still pervasive in the twenty-first century. For the\nWest, Palestine is not only a nuisance but also an enigma, one that defies\nthe solutions of power and embarrassingly turns Joe Biden into “Genocide\nJoe.” For the wretched of the earth, Palestine is a mirror in which to\nbehold their own reflection as they struggle for full liberation from the\nshackles of colonialism.\nThis Article contends that Palestine is most accurately comprehended\nthrough the concept of ongoing Nakba, an egregious crime against\nhumanity that intersects with the crimes of apartheid, genocide, and\nindefinite occupation but stands apart as its own indelible tragedy\ncomposed of a distinctive foundation, structure, and purpose. For the\nquestion of Palestine to be truly resolved, the international community\nmust grapple with the ongoing Nakba. Recognition of Nakba as a universal\nconcept, one acknowledged and prohibited by international norms, is\ntherefore the first step toward a just and lasting solution in Palestine.\nThe international community has a responsibility to dismantle the\nongoing Nakba that twentieth-century colonialism has constructed in\nPalestine. Zionism—only one modality of Jewish existence in Palestine—is\nconditioned upon the subjugation of the Palestinian people. There is a\nlong and rich history of Jewish existence in Palestine that is not premised\non systemic violence, domination, and ethnonational supremacy. Drawing\nfrom this tradition may provide inspiration, even though Zionism and its\nultimate manifestation in the ongoing Nakba have ruptured and\nrestructured reality in myriad ways that hinder our ability to imagine such\nfutures. But once the Nakba is centered and recognized, it becomes easier\n421. Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of\nGenocide in the Gaza Strip (S. Afr. v.

Existing approaches have been fixated for years on discussing the\nsolution in terms of one state versus two states, but the “state solution”\nformulation places the cart before the horse. This statist approach\ninforming the so-called peace process—a process that has rather\nentrenched the ongoing Nakba—has long obfuscated a simple truth:\nStatehood and liberation are not synonymous concepts.423\nTo break this impasse and undo the Nakba, we must start from\nrecognition and move toward reconstitution. If recognition of the Nakba\nmeans the acknowledgement of the injustice that modern Zionism has\ninflicted upon the Palestinian people, reconstitution is concerned with the\nreformulation of the polity in a way that dismantles the Nakba regime and\nreconfigures the constitutional design of the system(s) on an egalitarian\nand democratic basis.\nYet, before any reconstitution can take place, a number of\nfundamental issues must be addressed. These include return of those\nPalestinian refugees who desire it; reparations for the victims of the\nongoing Nakba; and redistribution of the material resources to ensure that\nthe ongoing Nakba does not morph, repackage, and maintain itself under\na private law infrastructure.\n424 Taken together, these components\ntherefore provide an initial legal framework to remedy the ongoing Nakba:\nRecognition, Return, Reparations, Redistribution, and Reconstitution.\nThe road to undoing the ongoing Nakba and achieving justice in\nPalestine may be torturous because it stands to disrupt international power\nstructures and radically transmute existing global hierarchies. This is\nprecisely what makes Palestine a possibility that is all the more important\nto pursue. Palestine and the Nakba offer rich universalist lessons to the\nworld. If Apartheid taught us about the dangers of racialism and the\npossibility of reconciliation, and the Holocaust taught us about the\nbanality of evil425 and warned “Never Again,” the Nakba can complicate\nour understanding of these lessons by reminding us that group victimhood\nis not a fixed category, and that a victimized group may easily become\nvictimizers.

Social data production also\npresents critical challenges for the legal regimes that encounter it. This\nArticle provides scholars and policymakers with the tools to comprehend\nthis new form of value creation through two descriptive contributions.\nFirst, it presents a theoretical account of social data, a mode of production\nthat is cultivated and exploited for two distinct (albeit related) forms of\nvalue: prediction value and exchange value. Second, it creates and\ndefends a taxonomy of three “scripts” that companies follow to build up\nand leverage prediction value and explains their normative and legal\nramifications.\nThrough the examples of tax and data privacy law, the Article\napplies these descriptive contributions to demonstrate how legal regimes\nfail to effectively regulate social data value creation. Tax law\ndemonstrates how legal regimes historically tasked with regulating value\ncreation struggle with this new form of value creation. Data privacy law\nshows how legal regimes that have historically regulated social data\nstruggle with regulating data’s role in value creation.\nThe Article argues that separately analyzing data’s prediction value\nand its exchange value is helpful to understanding the challenges the law\nfaces in governing social data production and its surrounding political\neconomy. This improved understanding will equip legal scholars to better\nconfront the harms of law’s failures in the digital economy, reduce legal\narbitrage by powerful actors, and facilitate opportunities to maximize the\nbeneficial potential of social data value.\n*.

Anna also consumes\nPineapple’s content on pregnancy and fetal development and engages\nwith other Pineapple users in their forum, swapping questions on\npregnancy and preparing for a new baby.\nPineapple collects, aggregates, and synthesizes data that Anna and\nother users share. This data includes not only the information that Anna\ninputs in the app but also data about the content she consumes and her\ninteractions with other users. Pineapple does not sell this data directly—\nin fact, their privacy policy explicitly states that they will never sell or\nlicense individual user data. But Pineapple does sell insights about their\nuser base as a whole to clients like advertisers, employment agencies, and\nconsumer credit agencies. This is how Pineapple makes its money—the\napp is free to Anna. Pineapple’s clients then combine the data they receive\nfrom Pineapple with data from other companies to build out a more\ncomplete picture of the behavior of pregnant people. This could include\ndata on TV viewing patterns from video streaming platforms, movement\nand sleep patterns from wearable fitness devices, or online purchasing\nbehaviors.\n2\n1. This example is adapted from various presentations made by Salomé Viljoen in\n2022 and 2023, including at the 2022 Annual Meeting of the American Society of\nInternational Law, Seventh Annual Detlev Vagts Roundtable.

But she does watch streaming\nservices, owns a wearable fitness device, and shops online. And Becca’s\nbehavioral patterns on these platforms have shifted in similar ways to\nAnna’s and other Pineapple users’ behaviors. Pineapple’s clients can,\ntherefore, infer that Becca is also likely pregnant and treat her accordingly.\nWhy do companies care about Anna’s and Becca’s pregnancy status?\nBecause early pregnancy data is incredibly valuable. Pregnancy signals that\na consumer is about to undergo a significant change in their daily habits\nand their buying activities; the birth of a child is a time when someone’s\nbuying habits, brand loyalties, and daily routines are in flux. Getting to\nsuch consumers early is a valuable opportunity to shape their future\npurchasing behaviors. Diaper companies can advertise to Becca or Anna\nbefore competitors and get them locked into their brand. Grocery stores,\nonline subscription services, car manufacturers, and others can also reach\nout, offering deals favorable to new parents that entice them to switch\nentrenched behaviors and brand loyalties. Aggregate pregnancy data also\nprovides an opportunity to understand the nature of consumer change\nmore generally—how and why do consumption patterns change? When\nare such changes most robust, and why? How can you predict (and modify)\nthose behavioral changes?\nData about Anna’s and Becca’s pregnancies is what this Article calls\nsocial data.\n3 Social data refers jointly to two interrelated types of data about\npeople. The first is data that directly materializes and stores traces of\nhuman activity.4 This includes, for example, information on Anna’s or\nBecca’s TV viewing patterns, ovulation, or movement. This type of social\ndata is directly collected from data subjects, like the data Pineapple collects\nand uses about Anna. The second is data that is used to apprehend, infer,\nor predict human activity.\n5 For example, Pineapple collects data about\nAnna (and other users) to aggregate and analyze for insights about\npregnant people as a group, which it sells to third parties. Those third\nparties may use this data in turn to gain insight about, and drive decisions\nregarding, Becca. Thus, data about Anna and her pregnancy is also data\n& Christoph Sorge, I Recognize You by Your Steps: Privacy Impact of Pedometer Data,\nComputs. & Sec., Jan 2023, no. 102994, at 1, 7 (demonstrating how fifteen minutes of\npedometer data alone—data collected on nearly every smartphone—can identify users).\n3. Part I provides a more detailed definition of this concept.\n4. This first category is adapted from Julie E. Cohen’s concept of the “data\nrefinery”—the data-processing practice of “refin[ing] and massag[ing] flows of personal\ndata to produce virtual representations . . . optimized for modulating human behavior\nsystematically”—as a “centrally important means of economic production.” Julie E. Cohen,\nBetween Truth and Power: The Legal Constructions of Informational Capitalism 66–68\n(2019) [hereinafter Cohen, Between Truth and Power].\n5. Part I describes the difference between the two below. But for now, it is important\nto note that data used to infer or predict human activity need not always derive from data\ndirectly about human activity. For further discussion of the significance of the second\ncategory, see Alicia Solow-Niederman, Information Privacy and the Inference Economy, 117\nNw. U. L. Rev. 357, 400–03 (2022).\n2024] VALUING SOCIAL DATA 997\nabout Becca’s pregnancy, even though it was not directly collected from\nBecca.6\nIndeed, data that can be used to infer or predict human activity\nneed not be collected from people at all—for example, data about weather\ncan be used to predict and infer commuting behavior. In contrast with the\nmore commonplace term “personal data,” “social data” nicely expresses\nthe view (and a central focus of this Article) that data is socially useful and\neconomically valuable—not only for what it can tell the world about any\none person, like Anna, but also, and especially, for what it can tell the world\nabout people.7\nThe value of Anna’s and Becca’s social data is what this Article refers\nto as prediction value.\n8 Prediction value is a particular form of use value that\nlies in social data’s capacity to infer or predict things about people—in this\ncase, pregnancy status—and to act on that knowledge. For example a firm\nwith access to Becca’s social data may send Becca a diaper coupon or free\nprenatal vitamins, a hospital where Anna will give birth may use it to\ninform labor and delivery staffing plans, or an employer’s hiring algorithm\nmay flag Becca as a potentially risky and expensive hire and exclude her\nfrom a pool of prospective employees. Social data stores the value of being\nable to apprehend behavior, to infer, predict, and direct the future actions\nof people (who are not always the data subject), and to develop informed\nstrategies to obtain some objective. It provides the valuable capacity to\nexert some measure of insight into and control over future behavior.\n9 The\ncapacity of social data to store insight into human behavior, guide\npredictions about that behavior, and optimize strategies to guide and\nchange human behavior is (much of) what drives companies to collect the\ndata they collect and use the data in the way that they do.\n10\n6.

Companies face\ngeneralized market pressure to engage in the accumulation and\ncultivation of social data and its prediction value to stay competitive.11\nIndeed, the widespread practice of treating social data as a key input to\nproduction is part of what it means to refer to contemporary capitalism as\nan informational capitalism.12 Recent technological transformations, like\nimproved chip processing power, ubiquitous connected devices like\nsmartphones, and improvements in machine-learning techniques, have all\ncontributed to the feasibility and utility of entities cultivating, refining, and\nextracting social data value.13 These technological changes have allowed\nentities to exploit for economic gain what has long been true: People are\nsocial beings, deeply knowable and materially influenced by relations to\none another. Thus, the stakes of understanding social data’s particular\nform of value, and the social and economic effects that its widespread\ncultivation produces, have grown more salient.\nA primary way the digital economy works is by using prediction value\nto increase monetary value: to grow profits by raising revenue and by\nlowering costs, or to grow market share (and, the thinking goes, future\nprofits) by expanding customer bases and entering new markets.\n14 As Part\nII will survey in greater detail, companies deploy a variety of strategies to\ntransform prediction value into exchange value—the priced, monetary\nvalue of a good, service, or company, typically expressed as a “market\nprice.” Exchange value, as a general theory and form of value, posits that\nthe value of a thing is the value derived from its exchange, expressed via\nand win back customers). Specifically, Eric Siegel covers Target’s use of big data to identify\npregnant customers: Target created a training model based on users who signed up for\nTarget’s baby registry and then applied it to customers who had not registered.

But it doesn’t have to be. Prediction\nvalue is distinct from (and not always neatly transformed into) exchange\nvalue. Part I provides greater detail defending the descriptive and analytic\nvirtues of cataloging this distinction.\nPrediction value confers on its holder the power to apprehend, shape,\nand thus exert some measure of control over people’s behavior. In fact,\nthe central preoccupation of privacy scholars and many other observers of\nthe digital economy is this potential for the control power of social data,\ncultivated for its conversion into priced value, to be repurposed toward\nother (potentially disempowering) ends.16 These purposes can coexist\nwith strategies to grow exchange value, such as the use of prediction value\nin labor settings to reduce operating costs by eroding workplace\nprotections, or lie outside the commercial realm entirely, such as\nimmigration officials repurposing location data cultivated for commercial\nends to detect and detain suspected undocumented immigrants.\n17 Indeed,\nmuch of privacy law’s traditional concern regarding privately cultivated\nsurveillance capacities is how such capacities fall into the hands of state\nactors and empower state action without sufficient scrutiny.\n18\nOf course, there is also some amount of speculative behavior around\nprediction value, as when entities, in order to secure valuations of high\nexchange value, overclaim or overpromise on the prediction value their\nproducts can deliver—a phenomenon the computer scientists Sayash\nKapoor and Arvind Narayanan refer to as “AI snake oil.”19 But this, too,\nhighlights the importance of disentangling assessments of social data value\nfrom priced exchange value—to better identify when claims of social data\nvalue (and its potential to transform into priced exchange value) are\n15.

Part I\nprovides greater detail on the concepts of social data and prediction value\nand argues for the distinctive value proposition of cultivating,\naccumulating, and using social data. It also provides theoretical context to\ndistinguish the concept of exchange value—priced monetary value—from\nthe concept of value more broadly and from prediction value as a\nparticular kind of use value.\nPart II offers a taxonomy of the business models and practices\ndeveloped around cultivating and using social data value. This taxonomy\ndivides the ways in which companies leverage prediction value to produce\nwealth and power for themselves and their investors into three scripts. The\nfirst script is direct and immediate conversion of social data value into\nexchange value through means such as direct sale of data, or through the\npremiums charged for targeted, as opposed to untargeted, advertising.\nThe second script is indirect and often delayed conversion of prediction\nvalue into exchange value through improving and developing new\nproducts and services, lowering costs, increasing and stabilizing revenue,\nand expanding into new business lines and industries. The third script is\nleveraging prediction value to accrue power. This script catalogs how social\ndata value can be a source of economic and political power, and thus of\nvalue to companies in their longer-term aims to secure market power and\nfavorable regulatory environments.

These practices include offering free and low-cost services,\ncreating ecosystems of products and services, and embarking on aggressive\nmerger and acquisition strategies. The Article shows how these strategies\ndiffer from traditional ones in ways that carry both legal and normative\nsignificance.\nIn Part III, this Article explores how disambiguating prediction value\nand exchange value (conceptually and normatively) can illuminate why\nsuch a variety of existing legal regimes fail to properly manage the social\nand economic disruptions that have accompanied capitalism’s\ninformational turn. In short, the same legal regimes that structure the\ntransformation of prediction value into exchange value fail to grasp—in\nits entirety—the messy, imperfect, and socially disruptive process by which\nthis transformation occurs. While the regulatory challenges of the digital\neconomy increasingly place strain on various areas of law, most consider\nonly small portions of this process and lack a systematic understanding of\nsocial data value production.22\nThe Article identifies two contexts in which the legal regimes that\nstructure this process index only part of its legally relevant features. The\nfirst context is legal regimes that have historically been tasked with\ngoverning value creation.\n23 Such regimes are focused on evaluating and\nregulating companies’ claims of exchange value and thus only apprehend\nor index prediction value (indeed, they only consider such value\nnormatively and legally relevant) at the point it is transformed into\nexchange value. As section III.B will show, this can miss many legally salient\nfeatures of prediction value, such as how it is cultivated and the wider\nsocial effects that cultivation creates. This leaves such regimes poorly\nequipped to properly achieve their normative goals. The Article chronicles\nthese struggles through the example of tax law.\nThe second context is legal regimes that have not historically\nunderstood themselves to be tasked with governing value creation but that\nare focused on the legal significance of informational power. Such regimes\nare attentive to the capacity of information about people to create power\nover them, but they regulate social data along a strict public–private divide.\nThrough the example of privacy and data governance law, the Article\nshows the conceptual and programmatic challenges of this approach.\nPrivacy and data governance law govern private data collection primarily\n22.

See infra Part III.\n1002 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 124:993\nvia individual control and consent rights.\n24 Privacy law traditionally\napprehends or indexes social concerns regarding prediction value, and its\ncapacity to coerce action and remake social relations, only if or when it\nfalls into the hands of public actors. And while the near-exclusive focus on\nstate surveillance in the field is shifting, both popular and doctrinal\nconceptions of socially coercive privacy harm remain primarily focused on\npublic, rather than private, actors. This ignores many salient concerns\nregarding informational power that arise as social data is imbricated into\nthe strategies of commercial actors and neglects the role of privacy and\ndata governance law in facilitating this form of value creation. It also\noverlooks the potential social benefits of prediction value if cultivated in\nprocedurally fair ways and put toward collectively determined ends.\nThis analysis has broad implications for other areas of the law. For\nexample, other legal fields that, like tax law, have historically been tasked\nwith governing value creation have legal frameworks developed around\nthe concept of exchange value and are not achieving their normative goals\nwhen applied to prediction value. Antitrust and financial regulation are\nprominent examples here, as there is growing evidence to suggest these\nregimes are struggling to index the profit-seeking behavior of technology\ncompanies and thus achieve these legal regimes’ regulatory briefs in the\ndigital economy.\n25 This understanding will also be invaluable to legal fields\nthat, like privacy and data protection law, have not historically been seen\nas regimes governing value creation and that, as a result, have not\n24.

First,\nthe Article’s primary goal is to provide a granular and reasonably\nsystematic accounting of the various ways data is used (or can be used) by\nplatforms and other firms to produce value (and power). It takes up this\ngoal in Part II. The Article’s second goal is to provide a theoretical account\nof social data as a value form whose cultivation is a primary aim of digital\nfirms—indeed, it is part of what marks the digital economy as “digital.”\nThis theoretical contribution, laid out in Part I, is in service of the primary\ngoal: to illuminate the distinctive value proposition of data and to help\nexplain the conceptual and normative significance of social data as a value\nform. Taken together, Parts I and II describe the current structure of social\ndata production and suggest why legal scholars and regulators have had\ntrouble grasping the implications and effects of data production under the\nparticular conditions of the contemporary digital economy. Part III\nexplores these legal implications directly. In addition to its two substantive\ngoals, the Article makes a modest methodological contribution to how\nlegal scholarship engages with law’s constitution and regulation of\nproduction. Its theoretical account supplies a way of analyzing and\nevaluating productive activity that does not, at the conceptual level,\npresuppose market ordering of that activity. In doing so, the Article\nprovides a model for similar analysis, when appropriate, for other kinds of\nproductive activity.\nI. PREDICTION VALUE AND THE DATA POLITICAL ECONOMY\nThis Part lays out an account of data as a material store of prediction\nvalue. The aim is to sketch out what this Article means when it uses the\nword “value” and why it’s useful to think about value in relation to social\ndata production. To do so, this Part explores three questions. First, what is\nprediction value? What makes it “valuable” and what makes it different\nfrom other kinds of value? Second, why do companies and governments\ncultivate and accumulate it? In other words, what is it good for, and how\ndoes it fit into current market behaviors and competitive practices? Third,\nif social data is so valuable, then where has it been all this time? Why are\npeople only talking about it now?\nA. What Is “Value”?: A Quick Background\nBefore the Article turns to social data and prediction value, it is\nperhaps worth saying a few words about the concept of value more\ngenerally. Nowadays, talking about the “value” of something refers to that\nCapitalism] (reviewing Cohen, Between Truth and Power, supra note 4, and Zuboff,\nSurveillance Capitalism, supra note 30) (discussing the inequitable impacts of informational\npower); Omri Marian, Taxing Data, 47 B.Y.U.

It captures a specific or “average”\nbuyer’s “willingness to pay” (WTP) for an additional (that is, marginal)\nunit of said item. WTP in turn is determined by a combination of external,\nchanging conditions (supply and demand) and internal, stable ones (the\nbuyer’s particular reasons for wanting the item). Expressed as a priced\nmarket value, WTP also captures relative desirability between goods, since\nbuyers (or most buyers, anyway) have finite wealth and must prioritize\namong their desires.\nThis is taken to be quite distinct from “values” in an ethical or\nsociological sense: beliefs regarding the importance of certain things or\nactions that motivate individual or societal behavior. It is in this sense that\none can speak of the “core values” of an institution or that someone places\na “high value on honesty.” Indeed, much of what makes exchange value\nsuch a useful concept in economics (and beyond) is its stated neutrality\non matters of ethical or sociological value: Value is simply the price\nsomeone is willing to pay.\n33 One need not inquire into why people want\nwhat they do and whether those reasons are good or bad (for example, as\nAdam Smith endeavored to show, “the market rewards us justly for our\nlabours”34). Such questions, to the extent they are answerable at all, lie\noutside the purview of economic theory.\nBut economics began as an exploration of these exact questions. How\ndo the individuals in a particular society put their limited time and\nresources toward productive activity? What does that say about what they\nvalue? What is the origin and nature of such value? Reflecting on these\nquestions, observers distinguished exchange value from what they called\n32. In classical political economy, exchange value (or Tauschwert) refers to only one\nattribute of a commodity: the proportion at which one commodity can be traded on the\nmarket for other commodities. See Jörg Guido Hülsmann, The Value of Money, Mises Inst.\n(Mar. 13, 2013), https://mises.org/library/value-money-0 [https://perma.cc/62ZC-TNLL]\n(referring to the Mengerian concept of “inner exchange value” and “outer exchange value”\nas innerer Tauschwert and äusserer Tauschwert). In this understanding of the term, exchange\nvalue isn’t necessarily money price, although a market price will generally bear at least a\nrough correspondence to a commodity’s exchange value. See Karl Marx, 1 Capital 138–39\n(Ben Fowkes trans., Penguin Books 1990) (1867). But the general adoption of marginalism\nin economic thought around the 1930s eliminated such distinctions: Discussions of different\nvalue-attributes fell off, and value was taken to measure how much a hypothetical buyer\nwould desire an additional unit of said item, expressed in the form of a price. See Elder\u0002Vass, supra note 15, at 18; Herbert Hovenkamp, Coase, Institutionalism, and the Origins of\nLaw and Economics, 86 Ind. L.J. 499, 503 (2011).\n33.

Id.\n2024] VALUING SOCIAL DATA 1007\n“use” value or “natural” value: the value one gets from, say, wearing one’s\nfavorite coat (that is, using it as a coat), as opposed to the value that one\nor another would pay to acquire the coat.35 These were not mere\ndifferences in the degree to which people valued things, which continues\nto be widely observed today. For example, any economist will point out\nthat the decision not to sell something—a home, a corporate asset, or one’s\nfavorite coat—is simply a signal that one values that thing over its (current)\nmarket value. Behavioral economists have added to this observation the\nconcept of “endowment effects”—that people systematically tend to\noverestimate the market value of something that they already have when\ncompared with what they would pay to obtain it (a testament to the notion\nthat people grow attached to things they think of as their own).\n36 Both of\nthese accounts, however, ground their explanations of such behavior in\nnumerical difference in value—quantitative assessments of the priced\nvalue of a particular good.37\nIn contrast, early economists used the concept of use value to express\na distinct way that a good could be valued, not simply differing degrees to\nwhich a good could be valued along the same dimension. So for example,\nwhen one enjoys the use of one’s favorite coat, how one enjoys it is distinct\nfrom its price. One feels fondness for it from its familiarity, aesthetic\nsatisfaction from its cut and drape on one’s body, and the pleasure of being\nwarm on a cool day. This all can be, in an abstract sense, translated into a\nprice if someone were to offer to buy the coat. But it would be a translation:\n35. The concepts of “use value” and “exchange value” are quite old. Marx quotes\nAristotle on the subject:\nFor twofold is the use of every object . . . . The one is peculiar to the\nobject as such, the other is not, as a sandal which may be worn is also\nexchangeable. Both are uses of the sandal, for even he who exchanges the\nsandal for the money or food he is in need of, makes use of the sandal as\na sandal. But not in its natural way. For it has not been made for the sake\nof being exchanged.\nMarx, supra note 32, at 179 n.3 (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted)\n(quoting Aristotle, Republic bk. I, ch. 9) (misquotation). This quotation is properly\nattributed to Aristotle’s Politics. See, e.g., Aristotle, Politics bk. I, at 41 (H.W.C. Davis, ed.,\nBenjamin Jowett, trans., Oxford Clarendon Press 1908) (c. 350 B.C.E.). As David Graeber\ndetails, Adam Smith’s famous “paradox of value” is also much older than the eighteenth\ncentury: St. Augustine argued that “‘according [to] their own merits,’” “plants are clearly\nsuperior to stones, animals to plants, humans to animals,” but because of humans’ fallen\nnature, and thus “endless physical needs and desires,” people value things like bread and\ngold over animals like mice. Graeber, supra note 33, at 441–42 (quoting St. Augustine, The\nCity of God, bk. IX, ch. 16). To St. Augustine, this characterizes how people “come to see\nthings through [their] own needs (use value) rather than their absolute worth” or “their\nposition along the Great Chain of Being.” Id.\n36.

Put another way, these are both instances when people are making an assessment\nof the current market price of such goods—deeming that price lower than what they\nconsider the goods’ exchange value.\n1008 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 124:993\nIt would leave out dimensions of what one derives from the use of one’s\nfavorite coat. Use value and exchange value thus captured distinct aspects\nof a good. The two concepts indexed different ways that people relate to\nand derive value from things, and different motivations they might have\nfor making or obtaining things. The disaggregated notions of value thus\ncorresponded to, or described, different aspects of “productive” or\neconomic activity. The two were related, of course, and much of early\neconomic thought was devoted to developing and debating various\naccounts for the origins of value and the formal causal or mathematical\nrelation between use value and exchange value.\n38\nThere is widespread agreement that classical political economists’\npreoccupation with developing some “true,” scientific, or systematic\nrelationship between the different notions of value was destined for\nfailure. The history of economic thought is marked by nonexchange\nconceptions of value coming into conflict with and ultimately being (albeit\nimperfectly and partially) transfigured into exchange value.\n39 Over time,\n“the value of an object became increasingly indistinguishable from its\nprice: how much potential buyers were willing to give up to acquire some\nproduct on the market.”\n40 And to be clear, this Article does not aim to\nrevive these old debates, nor to argue for or defend a formal and\nsystematic relationship between the two concepts of value.\nYet, in abandoning the study of distinct concepts of value, economics\nalso lost its ability to fully express—and thus take seriously on their own\nterms—how the uses of things can motivate and explain economic activity.\nThis was particularly true for things that were of high social or personal\nutility but that nonetheless had low exchange value. Or more accurately,\neconomic thought moved on from puzzling deeply over such enduring\n“paradoxes” of commercial activity to providing a ready answer for\nresolving them. The standard line is that such things suffer from having\nhigh total utility but low marginal utility. Thus, “undervaluation” problems\nhave, in theory, a simple solution. To properly value such things requires\n38. Early economic thought was divided into three schools: mercantilists, physiocrats,\nand political economists, all of whom took a different position on how value was created.\nGraeber, supra note 33, at 440. Mercantilists believed wealth originated from precious\nmetals (gold, silver); physiocrats believed it originated from nature, and hence, agriculture.\nThe classical political economists believed value was a product of human labor, that it\n“emerged . . . at exactly the point where our minds became a physical force in nature.” Id.\n39. And in turn, as economic thought permeated social thought more generally, the\nprocess of subordinating other ways of thinking about value to exchange value spread\nbeyond economic theory. For one treatment of the normative and ethical shortcomings of\nthis trend, see generally Elizabeth Anderson, Value in Ethics and Economics (1993). For a\nsociological account of how thinking of all political and social goals in terms of exchange\nvalue came to dominate policymaking, see generally Elizabeth Popp Berman, Thinking Like\nan Economist: How Efficiency Replaced Equality in U.S. Public Policy (2022).

Saying something has “economic\nvalue” is necessarily taken to mean that this value also takes a particular\nform: exchange value. But this Part endeavors to show that it can be worth\nreturning to the old tradition of disambiguating forms of value—not to\nrevive the old views of value entirely\n42 but to take seriously in the\nexploration of economic activity the distinctions between different ways of\ncultivating and deriving productive value, and the imperfect and messy\ntask of transformation that occurs between forms of value.\nB. What Is Prediction Value?\nSocial data production produces value from its capacity to materialize\nand store traces of human activity. This allows entities to catalog, analyze,\n41. Here a reader could ask, “Aren’t you just talking about commodification?” And\nthe answer is, in some sense, yes. But commodification better describes the social process\nthat follows from, or accompanies, the intellectual shift being described here. This shift is\nconceptual: how and why economics came to think of essentially all social value, and human\nbehavior, in terms of prices and price theory to begin with. Indeed, much criticism lodged\nagainst neoclassical economics is due to its tendency to engage in “economic imperialism,”\ncasting any behavior involving scarce resources within the conceptual precepts of\nneoclassical price theory. For a critical account of this trend, see generally Berman, supra\nnote 39; Don Herzog, Externalities and Other Parasites, 67 U. Chi. L. Rev. 895 (2000) (book\nreview). For example, family planning, racial discrimination, crime, marriage, divorce, drug\naddiction, politics, immigration, and suicide have all been cast as problems that can be\nthought of—and solved—via pricing and markets. See, e.g., Richard A. Posner, A Theory of\nPrimitive Society, With Special Reference to Law, in Chicago Studies in Political Economy\n149, 191–205 (George J. Stigler ed., 1988) (analyzing elements of family, tort, and criminal\nlaw as systems for selling and buying legal entitlements). On specific policy suggestions, see,\ne.g., Eric A. Posner & E. Glen Weyl, Radical Markets: Uprooting Capitalism and Democracy\nfor a Just Society 127–67 (2018) (proposing a market in immigration in which private\ncitizens could bid to host immigrants in exchange for a share of the income they earn);\nRichard A.

In other words, the\nvalue of social data lies in its capacity to apprehend and predict—and\nbased on such apprehension and prediction, to manage—social\nbehavior.\n43 Both apprehension and prediction and the behavioral\nmanagement capacities they endow have value. Apprehension and\nprediction can aid in planning how companies allocate resources,\nstreamline logistics, manage risks, and enter new sectors. Companies can\nuse data systems to affect human behavior (either directly or indirectly).\nFor instance, they can aid workforce efficiency and other goals and help\nmanage consumer interactions. These strategies, which companies can\npursue independently or at the same time, are covered in detail in Part II\nbelow.\n1. Defining Social Data. — Definitions of “data” and its use have a\nfraught and thorny history.\n44 Given considerable debate regarding the\naccuracy or usefulness of terms like “data” or “privacy” or “personal data,”\nit is worth saying a bit more about this Article’s use of the term “social\ndata,” as well as its limits. At its simplest, this Article uses the term “social\ndata” to mean data about people. This can include data collected directly\nfrom people—such as their movement around a city on foot or in a car,\ntheir breathing patterns and heart rate, or their cursor or eye movements\nacross a screen.45 It also includes data applied to make inferences about\n43. The value proposition here is that better prediction informs better strategies for\naction. The more an entity knows about a behavior or attribute and the effect of a proposed\nintervention on that behavior (or attribute), the more effectively it can convert prediction\ninto a desired outcome (e.g., watching more Netflix, buying more products of the right kind\non Amazon, driving longer hours on Lyft, being charged the highest price one is willing to\npay in an ad exchange). Increased efficacy can refer to a variety of comparative advantages\nin modulating behavior toward a desired goal. Greater prediction value can produce\ninterventions that are more accurate, more subtle, more widely deployed, more quickly\ndeployed, etc. The particular usage of prediction value will depend on the setting in which\nit is being used and the desired goal.\n44. See, e.g., Paul M. Schwartz & Daniel J. Solove, The PII Problem: Privacy and a New\nConcept of Personally Identifiable Information, 86 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1814, 1828, 1832, 1841–\n45 (2011) (detailing competing definitions of personally identifiable information (PII),\nincluding the limitation that PII is understood as solely information about one specific\nperson).\n45.

This Article uses “social data” because it\nbetter expresses the view that data is (almost) always produced for what it\ncan reveal about people, not individual persons.\n46 It thus readily expresses\nthe notion that data is used and is useful in the aggregate and is valued for\nits repurposable, aggregative, and relational properties.47 “Social data”\nalso avoids some semantic traps of the term “personal data,” which can be\ndefined expansively but is commonly defined far more narrowly in the\nmany privacy laws that use it. Thus, “social data” is both more accurate and\ninvokes the correct common intuitions about the concept.\nOne limitation of the term “social data” is that it may indeed be too\nexpansive, covering many forms of data that are not obviously about\npeople.\n48 Given the pervasive issue of “personal data” definitions failing to\ncapture relevant forms of data use, proceeding from a more expansive view\nmay be a welcome corrective. Moreover, if “social data” covers many forms\nof data that are not obviously about people (until that data is used to infer\nor act on human behavior in a particular application), this is not a prima\nfacie disqualifier for the term. Rather, it is a relevant feature of social data\nthat in turn implies conceptual and normative criteria for its appropriate\nregulation.\nAnother limitation may cut the other way: The concept leaves out\nforms of data value that do not derive from understanding, predicting, or\nintervening on human behavior. Other data may be valuable for its\ncapacity to predict things that have nothing whatsoever to do with human\naction. This Article takes no issue with this claim. Although such data may\nindeed produce value, it is at least plausible that such data production\nproduces less social disruption and transformation, and thus its cultivation\nposes less salient or novel legal issues. Given that digital technology\ncompanies themselves focus on human-derived or human-applied data,\nand that critical, scholarly, and policy-oriented communities similarly focus\n46.

See Viljoen, Relational Theory, supra note 6, at 609–12.\n48. One strong form of this claim is that it is unclear if any kind of modifier on “data”\nis needed at all. If we define “social data” as “any physical world observation rendered in\ndatafied form that goes on to be used to derive insight regarding human action and\nbehavior,” then it becomes hard to imagine what data being produced doesn’t fall within this\ndefinition. Or, if such data exists, that it is (economically, normatively, legally) trivial.\nHowever, showing the (plausible and interesting) proposition that the subset “social data”\nalso contains the set “data” is not the project of this Article. For now, this Article assumes\nthere is some subset of “data” composed of “social data,” as defined above, and that it is this\nsubset that is the Article’s subject of inquiry. The authors thank Thomas Streinz for first\ndrawing our attention to this intriguing point.\n1012 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 124:993\non the effects of datafication on human action and social life, this Article\nconstrains its inquiry to human-related data.\nIt is also important to note that although the term is useful as an\nanalytic category, if directly carried over into a legislative context, “social\ndata” could easily suffer from some of the same issues that plague\n“personal data.” This is because whether one focuses on data that is\n“personal” or “social,” data about people is not a quality or category that\nis inherent to data. It is instead a determination that must be made about\ndata, one that requires more information about the context, purpose, and\nprocesses that guide its collection and use.49 In this way, determining that\ndata is “social” is akin to legal rules whose application require fact-specific\ninquiries. So, whether social data qualifies as such (let alone whether it is\ncollected and used in appropriate ways) cannot be a predetermined\ndefinitional exercise. One cannot observe different categories of\ninformation—such as TV streaming data, biometric data, locational data,\nhousehold energy usage data, city water flow data, or weather data—and a\npriori determine which types of data, as a category, are personal or social,\nand which are not (although some may have greater propensity to be used\nas personal or social data based on what value-seeking strategies motivate\ntheir collection and use). Thus, “social data” is not an assessment of the\ntype of data being collected alone. Social data also depends on the\ncontexts in which it is collected and used. The reasons and the purposes\nof the data’s collection structure how it is cultivated and stored and are\ninformed by and constrain its use. Indeed, social data may be better\nunderstood as a category of action than as a category of object—an act that\nendows the thing being used (materialized stores of information) with the\nrelevant set of properties (social insight into human behavior).\nSo, “social data” is a definitional shorthand for the concept that\nhuman-relevant data value (and risk) is not about persons, but about\npeople. But there are other terms out there.50 Ultimately, this Article is\nmore interested in the underlying concept than any one semantic signifier\n49. This feature of “social data” is heavily influenced by Helen Nissenbaum’s theory\nof privacy as “contextual integrity.” See generally Helen Nissenbaum, Privacy in Context:\nTechnology, Policy, and the Integrity of Social Life (2010). But while contextual integrity\ncalls upon social context to engage in normative inquiry, we are merely interested in\ndescriptive inquiry regarding data about people—namely, how entities cultivate it and use\nit to produce value. This inquiry prefigures any normative evaluation of ways data has been\nput toward the project of apprehending people and intervening in their actions and\nwhether such data sharing is wrongful. “Social data” in our usage is thus a descriptive\ncategory of information, not a normative account of what makes information flows\nappropriate.\n50. See Cohen, Between Truth and Power, supra note 4, at 48–50 (describing the data\nflows about people as the “biopolitical public domain”); Neil Richards, Why Privacy Matters\n24–25 (2021) (favoring the term “human information” because it “refers us back to the\nhuman beings whose information is being used in some of the technologies that are the\nhallmark of the digital age”).\n2024] VALUING SOCIAL DATA 1013\nfor it. If the reader prefers another term for this underlying concept, then\nit can be substituted in.\n2. Defining Prediction Value. — This Article uses the term prediction\nvalue for the specific form of use value entities derive from the systematic\ncultivation of social data. It indexes the value of being able to infer or more\naccurately predict future actions or effects. The prediction value of social\ndata lies in the capacity of data to materialize apprehension and convert it\ninto control: It confers upon its holder the capacity to exert a desired effect\non future behavior. Capacity is not the same thing as using that capacity.\nSimilar to power in the physical sense, prediction value, stored via social\ndata, is a potential to convert into an effect (the exploitation of data’s\nprediction value via use).\nSocial data is thus the material store (or medium) of prediction value.\nIts production materializes the latent predictive value of human activity for\nother human action so that it can be stored, used, reused, aggregated, and\nrecombined with other data (other media of prediction value) across time\nand context, and mined for different kinds of insights and interventions.\n51\nMerging data with other data is a way to combine and compound\nprediction value. Analyzing data is a way to tap into and exploit prediction\nvalue. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine-learning models trained on\ndata demonstrate one significant way that companies distill prediction\nvalue into a defined (and generalizable) product.\nPrediction value is derived from data’s relational character. Because\npeople are social beings who are like one another, who are the products\nof social formation, and who construct their self-identity in dialogue with\nothers, datafied traces of observed actions and behaviors of the many have\nsomething meaningfully predictive to say about anyone.52 Data stores\nrepresent a stem-cell-like proto-asset that can be reapplied and specialized\nto predict behavior across a variety of settings.53\nThe general observation that information produces social control,\nand that this in turn can be exploited for commercial gain, is not novel.\nWhat this Article calls “prediction value” builds on related concepts in\nprior works. Shapiro identifies how platforms engage in worker\nsurveillance to cultivate “calculative rationalities,” which platforms exploit\nto manage worker behavior and maximize their own gain.54 Kean Birch,\n51. Cultivating data is less of a “harvesting” process than it is a “manufacturing”\nprocess. The “complete” picture of human activity is not replicated like some digital twin or\nmirror. The process is more one of an engineered, synthetic distillation of human activity\nthat reflects the goals of data production. See, e.g., Cohen, Between Truth and Power, supra\nnote 4, at 56 (describing data mining as generating new techniques and capabilities that\ndistill troves of social data into “Big Data”).\n52.

Jean Tirole details how “managing the\nflow of information about individuals’ behavior” allows entities to “achieve\nsocial control,” which he argues can both promote prosocial behavior and\nplatforms’ use of data and computation to derive value through strategically inserted\ninefficiencies in the market encounters they facilitate.

Prediction Value Versus Exchange Value. — Social data production\nmaterializes and stores value (and risk) in ways that are distinct from and\nnot always neatly transformed into exchange value.\n67 Robert Babe\nprovided an impressively prescient distillation of the problem: Money\nprice states how much exchange value an informational commodity\n“contains” but is silent regarding what he calls its “quantity of\ninformation” (a concept loosely akin to what this Article calls its prediction\nvalue).68 Data, in other words, is different.69\nAs Babe notes, for neoclassical economic theory (although not,\nimportantly, older traditions) to make sense of informational value, it\nneeds to be reduced to exchange value to be indexed and to “count” as\nvalue in economic terms. But social data “does not fulfil[l] the definitional\nor conceptual requirements of commodit[ies]” as understood by\neconomists of the time.70 Moreover, attempts to translate or reduce\ninformation’s prediction value into such terms “obscures many essential\nproperties of information, as well as consequences of informational\nexchange.”71\nThese distinct properties also suggest diverse applications in which, as\na general matter, one kind of value enjoys a relative advantage over the\nother. Prediction value would be well spent, for example, in allocating\ngoods for which priced market allocation might be independently\nwrongful.72 For example, one may think it wrong to affix a price to hearts\nfor transplant, but this does not mean one would not value informational\nmechanisms to accurately identify which operating theaters need hearts\nand which may supply them. The same might be true in the reverse. For\nexample, one may think the singular quality of artistic creativity and\nidiosyncrasy in aesthetic taste are intrinsically valuable, so one ought to\nresist allocating productive resources to artistic production based on\n66.

In other words, one may not want to overfit how one produces\nfuture artistic work to predictions based on what people enjoyed in the\npast, even if such predictions are accurate and regularly updated for\nchanging taste.73 Instead, one may want to preserve the societal capacity to\ninvest in and support artistic work that breaks new ground. Investments in\nartistic work via exchange value are better equipped—in theory at least—\nwith the capacity to support and reward true novelty and creative\ninspiration.\nIn some ways, prediction value is more general than priced exchange\nvalue.74 Prediction value can be converted into exchange value, but it need\nnot convert into wealth directly to exert power or control, or to drive\ndecisions.75 Prediction value can exert social discipline on others and\nenact material outcomes or moral judgment that we do not currently\nexpress as market discipline (and perhaps could not so express even if we\nwanted to).\nIn other ways, prediction value is decidedly less general than exchange\nvalue. Prediction value of a given data point or dataset is contingent and\nunpredictable in ways that are unlike a more typical asset or commodity.\nPrediction value is not stable across contexts76 and—as data ages, or is\ncombined with other data, or new analytic techniques or technical\napplications are developed—prediction value may shrink or grow.\nPrediction value is (in some general sense at least) nonrivalrous, but it’s\nalso not straightforwardly fungible and thus not readily subject to\ntraditional forms of transfer and redistribution. Marc Porat, an early\ninformation economist, said that information was, by nature, a\n“heterogenous commodity” that cannot be collapsed into one sector—like\nmining. For economists to make sense of it, he argued, they needed to\nthink of the production, processing, and distribution of information goods\nand services as an activity rather than as a product.77 While a growing\n73.

See Babe, supra note 67, at 42 (“[N]eoclassicists’ notions of ‘market,’ ‘price,’\n‘value,’ ‘commodity,’ ‘demand,’ ‘supply,’ and ‘exchange’ are but specialized instances of\nbroader communicatory phenomena.”).

See infra section II.A.3 for a discussionof using predictionvalue to gain or exert power.\n76. Naturally, problems arise when social data resources have high predictive value\nfor a given task, but the task is one for which using such data is inappropriate. Much like its\nanalytic value, normative analysis of when predictive value may be legitimately spent is also\nnot stable across contexts. See Nissenbaum, supra note 49, at 129 (“[T]here is . . . great\ncomplexity and variability in the privacy constraints people expect to hold over the flow of\ninformation, but these expectations are systematically related to characteristics of the\nbackground social situation.”).\n77.

Prediction Value Into Exchange Value? — As life becomes\nincreasingly digitized and datafied, prediction value takes on a greater\neconomic and conceptual significance. Many of the largest companies in\nthe world have, at least in part, gotten that way by accumulating and\nexploiting prediction value. This in turn puts general market pressure on\nother companies and entities to do the same thing to retain their market\nposition against competitors.79\nAs some of the scholarship reviewed above suggests, companies face\npressure to transform prediction value into exchange value, or at the very\nleast translate prediction value into exchange-value terms for investors\nand, to a lesser extent, regulators. Yet not all prediction value is readily\nreducible to exchange value, and there are several reasons, both practical\nand normative, to resist attempts to do so.\nPart II explores in greater detail how such transformation works: what\nis lost and entrenched in the process, what is the effect on the political\neconomy of prediction value, and what are some legal issues that arise\nalong the way. Prediction value confounds traditional approaches to\nregulating and apprehending value in law. This is a problem insofar as\nmany areas of law (following the “if there’s no price, there’s no value”\nview) do not register, apprehend, or count as significant forms of value\nproduction that do not readily convert into exchange value.\n80 As Part II\nsurveys, many legally and normatively relevant decisions regarding the\nproduction alone (the activity) still only partially captures total prediction value.

Why Datafy? And Why Take Data Value Seriously?\nFocusing on data’s prediction value helps home in on two questions.\nFirst, why are companies using time, money, and energy to collect data to\nbegin with? And second, if managing access to information has always\nbeen a source of power, why is it worth paying particular attention to\nprediction value, in the form of social data, now? These questions prefigure\nmany of the disruptions and legal issues that result from commercial\nsurveillance, and that have received sustained popular and scholarly\nattention.\nEntities looking to exert influence have long used the controlled\nmanagement of information to engage in worldmaking and to understand\nand shape human behavior.\n81 But only recently has it been economically\nfeasible to mine, store, and generate prediction value at scale.82 In other\nwords, it takes a particular set of conditions for the accumulation of\nprediction value to become an imperative of commercial competitive\nsuccess. These conditions include innovations in the cultivation, storage,\ntransfer, aggregation, and combination of social data,83 and improvements\nin data science and machine-learning techniques to derive insights from\nlarge data flows and to apply them via trained models. Together, these\nimprovements all contribute to the feasibility and utility of exploiting\nsocial data for prediction value at scale.84\nThese innovations in turn allow entities to exploit for economic value\nthat which has long been true: People are social beings, deeply knowable\nand materially influenced by our relations to one another. This capacity\n81. See Sarah E.

Consider a simple analogy to energy. In its natural form, as water, lightning, sun,\nand wind, energy has always existed and has long been known to be a useful source of power.\nBut it was only over the course of the nineteenth century that people developed the\ntechniques to store and transmit energy (and obtained the necessary economic conditions\nto make the mass adoption of such techniques feasible). This is when energy’s capacity or\npower to do work in the physical sense (i.e., to generate heat and light) could play a\ntransformative role in the political economy.\n83.

The\nappropriate response, it follows, to the question “why datafy” is to reject\nthe premise that datafication can produce social and economic value, and\ninstead to emphasize and center its corrosive effects on individual\nautonomy and the epistemic justice issues raised by the platform\neconomy’s distortionary effects on knowledge production.\nThe relation between knowledge production, profit accumulation,\nand power preoccupies several observers. For example, Zuboff is clearly\nconcerned with issues of epistemic justice that arise from the walled\ngardens and skewed paths of platform knowledge formation.\n85 Others\nraise concerns about the challenges of cultivating self-knowledge and the\ncapacity for self-formation in the shadow of such “surveillance empires.”86\nStill others (including one of the authors of this Article) consider the\nimpact that the private curation of social knowledge forms has on public\nscientific inquiry and the future of social scientific work.\n87\n85.

At least part of the answer is because\nsocial data is indeed valuable to them, in some form or another, for some\nreason or another.

This distinction helps\nto diagnose how and why entities go about cultivating, storing, and\nexploiting social data for gain, and how these activities meet, challenge,\nand transform legal forms. Clarifying the two modes of value production\nmay also help index the chicanery that is, admittedly, rampant among\ncertain corners of the digital economy, where overblown claims of how\nthese two forms of value relate to one another may be used to obscure and\nbefuddle.94 Part II considers how companies translate or transform\nprediction value into exchange value.\nII. THE BUSINESS OF SOCIAL DATA\nSocial data as a value form has encouraged the growth of business\nmodels and corporate behaviors that leverage prediction value to produce\nboth wealth and power for companies and their investors. These business\nmodels and behaviors have important normative and legal implications.\nThe capacity of existing law to grapple with those implications varies and\nis, in many cases, inadequate. This Part begins by cataloging three scripts\nthat companies take when leveraging prediction value. It describes the\nbusiness models and practices that have emerged as companies pursue\nthese three scripts, which have important normative and legal\nimplications. It then explores some of the business practices that\ncompanies use to accumulate social data—in particular, practices that\nfocus on growth and expansion often at the expense of current profits.\nThis Part highlights all of these business models and practices and their\nimportant normative and legal implications.\nTo be clear, data is important to the digital economy, but it is not the\nsole source of value nor is its acquisition and use the sole cause of\ncontemporary digital firm strategies. While this Article argues that the\nimportance of social data to business strategies has been\nunderappreciated, it is not arguing that all value of digital companies is\ndata value. This Part’s primary aim is to provide a granular and reasonably\n93.

Nothing about this account should\nbe read to suggest that data is the only driver of value in the digital\neconomy. Indeed, it may not even be the largest driver of value; that is an\nempirical question beyond the scope of this Article. What this Part does\nargue is that data value is an important form of use value, whose cultivation\nprefigures several strategies to transform that value into profit. Many firms\nin the digital economy deploy these strategies in their various forms.\nA. The Three Scripts\nThis section catalogs three scripts that companies take when\nattempting to leverage prediction value, as well as the business models and\npractices associated with those paths. These three scripts are not mutually\nexclusive. Companies may engage in different scripts at different points in\ntheir corporate lives. Some companies may never engage in some of the\nscripts. Some companies may engage in multiple scripts simultaneously.\nThese companies may either engage in multiple scripts within a single\nbusiness line or, perhaps more commonly, may operate in multiple\nbusiness lines that are engaging in different scripts.\nThe first script is direct conversion of prediction value into exchange\nvalue.95 This direct conversion transforms data about people into money\nfor companies through means such as targeted advertising. The second\nscript is indirect conversion of prediction value into exchange value by\nleveraging prediction value to improve products and services, reduce\ncosts, develop new products and services, and expand into different\nbusiness lines and industries.96 The third script is not directly focused on\nconverting prediction value into exchange value. Instead, in the third\nscript, companies focus on transforming data about people into power for\ncompanies.\n97\n1. Script One: Directly Converting Prediction Value Into Exchange\nValue. — Companies primarily achieve the first script—the direct\nconversion of prediction value into exchange value—either through the\nsale and license of social data or through targeted advertising.98\nThe sale and license of social data are the most obvious and legible\nway that companies can convert social data into money.\n99 The data\n95.

As is explored in greater detail\nbelow, in reality, targeted advertising is a more complex example. See infra sections II.A.2–\n.3. It implicates not only the first script but a range of strategies to exploit prediction value.\nThe intended focus here is the direct markup, or additional amount, platforms can charge\nadvertisers for a targeted ad as opposed to an untargeted one. This markup presents (in\ntheory) a direct exchange value amount companies are willing to pay for the superior\nprediction value offered by a targeted ad. Script two strategies include using prediction\nvalue to improve a platform’s advertising product by nudging users or experimenting with\nhow ads are presented to maximize the likelihood that users will click. See infra section\nII.A.2. And script three strategies include accumulating consumers’ purchasing and other\nonline behaviors to exert desired behavioral changes or to secure positions of market power.\nSee infra section II.A.3.\n2024] VALUING SOCIAL DATA 1025\nData about people allows companies to target their advertisements to\nthe individuals who are most likely to be interested in the product.105\nStrollers are advertised to pregnant women but not teenage boys. Dutch\novens are advertised to avid cooks but not people who live on microwave\ndinners. Nicholas Negroponte presciently foresaw the potential of\ntargeted advertising in the mid-1990s.106 He presented the example of\ndigital technology facilitating a person in the market for a car receiving\nnothing but car ads and, additionally, having those ads geographically\ntailored to include sales from local dealers.\n107 Social data collection by\ncompanies has enabled Negroponte’s predictions to come to fruition.\nSocial media platforms like TikTok collect data not only on their users’\nactivities on the platform but also track their movements across hundreds\nof thousands of other websites, thus allowing them to gauge potential\npurchases and offer advertisers access to users with purchase intents that\nmatch the advertisers’ products.108\nTargeted advertising is a central way in which companies are able to\ntake the prediction value that they draw from social data and turn it into\nexchange value. Companies can earn money by extracting social data,\nanalyzing that data to divide people into categories based on salient\nfeatures, and then auctioning ad space at a premium based on the premise\nthat those ads are properly targeted to the most relevant people.109 For\nmany tech companies, this means of leveraging prediction value\nconstitutes the lion’s share of their revenues. For example, more than\nseventy-five percent of Alphabet’s revenues came from online advertising\nin 2023.110 Even more stark is Meta Platforms, Inc., in which 98.6% of the\n105.

They are essentially selling to advertisers their capacity to\npredict which products will be most salient to specific consumers.112\n2. Script Two: Indirectly Converting Prediction Value Into Exchange\nValue. — Companies transform data about people directly into revenue\nthrough the sale and license of data, as well as targeted advertising. But\nthese methods of direct conversion are not the only means by which\ncompanies convert data about people into company revenues. In general,\ncompanies use social data to expand and improve their existing business\noperations. Through this expansion and improvement, companies will\n(eventually) increase revenues and profits, thus indirectly converting\nprediction value into exchange value. This emphasis on data accumulation\nand analysis is most strongly associated with Big Tech.\n113 As many of the\nexamples in this section will demonstrate, however, using prediction value\nto improve and expand business operations is not limited to tech\ncompanies.\nThis section divides the means of indirect conversion into three\ncategories and describes some of the business practices associated with\neach.\n114 These categories are: (a) lowering costs, (b) increasing and\nstabilizing revenues, and (c) expanding business operations.\na. Lowering Costs. — The predictive capacity of social data allows\ncompanies to lower their costs. As this section makes clear, some of these\ncost-lowering methods are benign while others are more controversial.\nPrediction value can allow companies to identify inefficiencies in their\nproduction. As Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee explained, “The\ndata revolution has turned customers into unwitting business consultants,\n111.

These categories and their accompanying descriptions are not meant to be\nexhaustive. This section highlights some of the prominent ways that companies in the digital\neconomy use social data value, focusing on practices with particularly important legal and\nnormative justifications. It also aims to acknowledge the existence of both harmful business\npractices and socially beneficial ones.\n2024] VALUING SOCIAL DATA 1027\nas our purchases and searches are tracked to improve everything from\nwebsites to delivery routes.”115\nBy identifying and eliminating these inefficiencies, companies are\nable to streamline their operations and lower costs. These productivity\ngains are often broadly beneficial. For example, social data that allows\ngrocery stores to more accurately predict the exact state of ripeness that\nconsumers prefer for their bananas and to adjust their purchase and\ndelivery timing accordingly would increase the grocery stores’ sales,\nprevent food waste, and provide consumers with optimally delicious\nbananas.\nThe healthcare industry is one area where data analysis has been used\nto identify and streamline inefficiencies and achieve productivity gains.\n116\nIntel recently partnered with a French hospital and used big data analytics\nto produce fifteen-day predictions of emergency visits and hospital\nadmissions, which then allowed the hospital to plan their staffing to meet\nthe anticipated needs.117 The hospitals should, therefore, be able to lower\ntheir costs by not overstaffing during slower periods. And the patient\nexperience should be improved by ensuring adequate staffing when they\nreceive treatment.\nCompanies’ use of prediction value to lower costs have also led to\nmore controversial techniques. Efforts to streamline production and\nmaximize productivity based on social data can lead to what Zephyr\nTeachout refers to as “extreme Taylorism.”\n118 Social data applied to\nextreme monitoring of workers has allowed longstanding principles of\nworker management to be applied with a far greater degree of precision\nand pervasiveness. Employers can use data in real time to increase or\ndecrease pay based on the employee’s efficiency. For example, they may\n115.

DoorDash pays drivers extra if they\nsucceed in “challenges,” which typically involve completing a set number\nof deliveries in a set period of time, along with other possible\nrequirements.122 Studies have shown that these techniques induce workers\nto work longer hours, or attract similar numbers of workers, for lower pay\noverall.\n123\nBehavioral price discrimination is the practice of adjusting wages\nbased on factors unrelated to employees’ productivity at work. Factors such\nas employees’ health status, or even their credit scores, gathered outside\nof the workplace, could be used by companies to differentiate wages.124\nDynamic labor pricing is another possible means of algorithmic wage\ndiscrimination. While dynamic labor pricing is used in response to supply\nand demand imbalances, evidence from Veena Dubal and others suggests\nthat companies can respond to those imbalances with real-time wage\nadjustments based on social data value.125 For example, wage\nexperimentation may be used by companies to pinpoint personalized or\nnear-personalized reserve price wages to accomplish the highest levels of\nproductivity for the lowest labor costs under dynamic conditions of shifting\nsupply and demand.\n126 Gamification or other behavioral techniques are\n119.

As the examples above show, evidence\nsuggests these social data value techniques may induce labor supply even\nat inefficient (from the perspective of the worker) price levels. Thus, the\nrole of social data in the context of algorithmic wage discrimination has\nparticularly important normative and legal implications. Brishen Rogers\nhas argued that the practices of worker surveillance that allow for\nalgorithmic wage discrimination and accompanying reductions in overall\nwages result in class disempowerment.\n128 And Dubal has argued that the\npractice of algorithmic wage discrimination goes against the norm of equal\npay for equal work that serves as the basis for many of the country’s\nantidiscrimination laws, as well as the general norm of fairness within the\nwage setting.\n129 While these practices are currently most common in the\ncontext of the gig economy, they are moving to more traditional\nemployment settings.130\nCompanies use prediction value to lower their costs in various ways—\nsome beneficial, others more harmful.

For example, by\nconsolidating and analyzing databases, retailer Dollar General discovered\na pattern of customer purchases peaking near closing time.\n132 The\ncompany inferred from this that later store hours would better\naccommodate customer needs and saw a 9.5% increase in sales within a\nyear.\n133\nPrediction value can also result in companies increasing their\nrevenues by accessing new streams of potential customers. Fintech is an\nimportant example of this. Fintech platforms leverage a wide array of\nsocial data and machine-learning techniques to make consumer-lending\ndecisions.134 The social data used by fintech companies moves beyond\nmeasures that have traditionally been used by financial institutions, such\nas income and credit scores, and incorporates alternative data into their\nlending decisions.135 This alternative data can range from personal health\ninformation to data gleaned from social media activity.136 The prediction\nvalue that comes from this data allows fintech companies to extend credit\nto borrowers who might not qualify absent this additional social data.137\nTapping this new stream of customers increases their revenues.\n138\nThe examples discussed thus far are uses of prediction value to\nincrease revenues that are mutually beneficial to companies, consumers,\nand at times, society more broadly. But other uses of prediction value to\nincrease revenues can produce more ambiguous outcomes. A central\nexample is the way that social data can enable predatory pricing behaviors.\nThese predatory pricing behaviors take a couple of flavors. The first\nis price discrimination.

Google, for instance, the State alleged that Google induced\nadvertisers to bid their true value to develop detailed predictions of each\nadvertiser’s personalized willingness to pay.\n141 The company then overrode\npreset price floors to use advertisers’ true bids against them by secretly\ngenerating unique and custom per-buyer floors based on what buyers had\nbid in the past.142 While each individual transaction between customer and\ncompany under such conditions is still, in theory, locally efficient, it does\nmean that at least some consumers will face higher prices for identical\nproducts. Moreover, as Stigliz notes, the general practice of such price\ndiscrimination can be harmful to overall market efficiency in the longer\nterm, especially in the context of proprietary exchange mechanisms where\nsuch prices are not subject to public scrutiny.143\nCompanies use various forms of social data to predict consumer\nbehaviors in order to engage in price discrimination. Online consumers\ncan be identified through a variety of means, such as cookies, which allow\ncompanies to track consumers’ digital footprints. These digital footprints\nallow companies to predict purchasing preferences.\n144 Merely knowing the\nphysical location of the online shopper can allow for price discrimination\nbecause the online seller can tailor their price to those in local brick-and\u0002mortar stores.\n145 Amazon has the capacity to collect data on behaviors such\nas a consumer hovering a mouse over a product or viewing a product\nmultiple times, which can then allow Amazon to display higher prices for\nthe consumers it believes are most likely to purchase the product.146 And\n139.

Amazon, for example, uses both\ndata from customers’ past purchases and data on general purchasing\nbehaviors to dynamically manage product price and presentation to\nexploit customers’ behavioral biases.149 This dynamic pricing and\npresentation, in turn, hinders customers’ ability to find the lowest-priced\nproducts available on Amazon’s website and to comparison shop with\nother retailers.150 This inability to comparison shop both within and\noutside the platform limits consumers’ ability to use traditional exit\nmechanisms to discipline Amazon. Thus, Amazon’s use of social data value\nto engage in personalized pricing and presentation strategies stabilizes the\ncompany’s revenues but also provides more opportunities to increase\nrevenues via price discrimination.\nThis section has explored just a few of the ways in which companies\nare able to use prediction value to increase and stabilize revenues, thus\nconverting prediction value into exchange value.

Or they could use social data to expand their operations into\nentirely new industries.\nWith respect to developing new products and services within their\nown industries, prediction value allows companies to determine which\nofferings will be most desirable to customers by taking into account\nknowledge that the companies have on their preferences and needs from\nanalyzing social data.\n152 The prediction value derived from vast amounts\nof social data replaces traditional product-development strategies that\nrelied on expert intuition and smaller data-gathering activities such as\nfocus groups. This leads to a lower-risk and higher-efficiency approach to\nproduct development.153 The companies are then able to garner revenues\nthrough these new products and services, all while needing to price in less\nrisk and uncertainty associated with entering a new venture—thus\nindirectly converting prediction value into exchange value.\nThere are a multitude of examples of companies using social data to\neffectively expand within their own industries. Netflix became a creator of\nentertainment content rather than simply a streaming service for third\u0002party content. Netflix entered the world of content creation with the\nadvantage of social data on the viewing habits of millions of its subscribers.\nThrough this social data, Netflix was able to predict factors that would lead\nto the success of newly created shows, such as the appeal of different\nsubject matters and actors.154 Its first original series, House of Cards,\ndebuted in 2013 to great success, and the company continues to leverage\nprediction value when creating original content.\n155 Food delivery services,\nsuch as DoorDash, have moved outside of restaurant delivery into grocery\ndelivery. When DoorDash launched DashMart in 2020, commentators\nhighlighted that its customer data, as well as its internal data on optimizing\ndelivery, would give DoorDash a competitive edge in providing this new\ntype of food delivery service.156 Fintech is another area in which using\ngenerally Yuanzhu Zhan, Kim Hua Tan, Yina Li & Ying Kei Tse, Unlocking the Power of Big\nData in New Product Development, 270 Annals Operations Rsch. 577 (2018).\n152.

In the third script, the utility of social data as a factor\nof production is to produce and store a form of power that prefigures any\nsingle plan for how to put that power toward wealth creation.\n170 Script\nthree thus describes both the residual form of unconverted data value and\nprediction value’s initial form.\nScript three catalogues ways that the social data value is put toward\nstrategies of innovation to obtain, hold onto, and make the most of market\npower.\n171 Companies are of course ultimately interested in generating\nwealth and profits. But this drives companies not only to engage in the\ndaily activity of profitmaking, as described in scripts one and two above,\nbut also to engage in meta-strategies meant to help hold onto and\nmaximize those profits,\n172 their market position, and the business\nstrategies they used to obtain such profits—in other words, to cultivate and\nretain market power.\n173 The cultivation of data power via script three gives\n169.

Also, it should be noted that the folklore and \nmythology of many countries and the legends of many aboriginal tribes seem to be inte\u0002grally related -- if not completely bound -- to the belief that this planet's skies are \noccupied, perhaps even populated, by entities supe!'ior to man. \nThousands of books and pamphlets on the UFO phenomenon have appeared, offering \na wide range of speculation and explanation. Some of these works were first published \nin the lSth century. An appreciable wave of \"flying saucer\" literature appeared in the, \n1920' s, simultaneously with astronomers' growing interest in other planets. The most. \npopular thesis has always been that the UFOs and theh· occupants are visitors from \nanother planet or from a distant star system. However, in 1818, some individuals \nbecame convinced that the earth is hollow and that another and alien race occupies its \ninterior. Since 1944, much material has been published to support this \"inner earth\" \ntheory and the hypothesis that UFOs originate there. \niii \nA large part of the available UFO litel'ature is closely linked with mysticism and \nthe metaphysical. It deals with subjects like mental te!.epathy, automatic writing, and \ninvisible entities as well as phenomena like poltergeist manifestations and \n\"possession.\" One school of thought holds that flying saucers are Biblical \"signs in the \nsky\" that portend the Second Coming. Another believes that an invisible fourth- or \nother-dimensional world is involved. Some groups have concluded that mankind is \nbeing, and may have always been, manipulated by extraterrestrial forces -- the UFO \noccupants. Others detail the endless battle between \"good\" and \"evil'1 believing that the \nUFOs play an int\\\"!gral part in this \"war.\" Unearthly ,,police forces\" are desclibed and \nexplained. \nMany of the UFO reports now being publis!~ed in the popular press recount alleged \nincidents that are strikingly similar to demoniac possession and psychic phenomena \nwhich have long been known to theologians and parapsychologists. Therefore, \nreferences to these subjects have been included as well as references to occult works \nwhich have similarities to the general tone and content of the UFO literature. \nA major objective of this bibliography was to gather material from the physical \nsciences which related to the UFO phenomrJnon. The results of this intensive effort \nwere a collection of articles which appeared in scientific and technical journals. Some \ndiscussed UFOs in general terms in light of the limitations of present physical \ntheories, and others explore peripheral areas, such as ball lightning and interstellar \ntravel, which relate to certain theoried regarding UFOs. Admittedly the number of \nsuch \"hard science\" references is small, but they fill an important place in this \ncollection. \nFor his very useful contribuHon, the section on mirages, I wish to thank \nLt. Col. Daniel H. Lufkin, USAF, Chief of the Aerospace Sciences Division of the \nEnvironmental Technical Applic·ations Center, Military Airlift Command, U.S. Air \nForce. The references are thf: best treatments, theoretical and practical, of this \nclassical subject. Because of its special nature, I have incorporated his bibliography \nseparately as appendix 1. These items are not included in the author index, nor are \nothers in the addenda. \nThis two-year survey of the growing UFO literature reveals many publications \nthat are the result of painstaking research, yet in its entirety, contradictions are far \nmore common than consistencies. It is also noteworthy that points of view are taken \nup by factions, each of which seems convinced that its answer to the UFO riddle is the \nright one and the only one. \niv \nI have sought to include items of scholarly interest and intent, and to make the \nbibliography as useful as possible for both scholars and general readers interested \nin the subject. The principal difficulties in achieving completeness are the great \nvolume of UFO and UFO-related literature, and the fact that much of it is privately \npublished and of limited distribution. \nScientific theory of today often becomes fact tomorrow. The line between the \npossible and the impossible is arbitrary. Many misconceptions pass for information. \nOne day, perhaps within our time, out of all the contradictions surrounding the UFO \nphenomenon, man may discover to his complete satisfaction its exact nature and \norigin. \nJuly 1969 LYNNE. CATOE \nv \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nMuch of the \"flying saucer\" literature of the past twenty years was privately \nprinted and poorly distributed and would have quickly and permanently disappeared \nif it had not been carc:fully prese:--.:ed by individual collectors and students of the \nphenomenon. This bibliography c .. l!ld not have been compiled without the full and \nselfless cooperation of such collr-:ctors throughout the world. Many of these people \ngave most fredy of their time. and their assistance and enthusiasm was of inestimable \nvalue. I am particularly grateful to the following individuals who located rare items \nor, in some cases, ever. lent their entire collections to this project for copying. Others \npainstakingly supplied information which made it possible to locate obscure items, and \noffered practical suggestions and lists of books which they felt should be included. \nJan Aldric~i \nHulvio ~rant Aleixo \nHemani Ebecken de Araujo \nGra!r B::t.rker \nWilliam Don Barnes \nLionel Beer \nOtto 0.

Key findings include the scale of the return (over 200,000 people observed by the UN), the psychological significance for Palestinians reclaiming war-torn homes, and lingering tensions over unresolved hostage issues. \n\n**Key Facts & Data** \n- **Timing**: Return began January 27, 2025, under a ceasefire agreement that followed prolonged negotiations. \n- **Numbers**: UN observed 200,000+ people moving north within one day. \n- **Conditions**: Returnees faced heavily destroyed infrastructure; many homes were damaged or obliterated. \n- **Hostage Context**: Hamas informed Israel that 8 hostages slated for release during the ceasefire’s first phase were already dead. \n- **Ceasefire Terms**: Included Israeli troop withdrawals to buffer zones and a hostage-for-prisoner exchange. \n\n**Verbatim Quotes** \n1. **Yasmin Abu Amshah**, returnee: *“It was a long trip, but a happy one. The most important thing is that we returned.”* \n2. **Ismail Abu Matter**, displaced Palestinian: *“It’s the joy of return. We had thought we wouldn’t return, like our ancestors.”* \n3. **Hamas statement**: *“A victory for our people, and a declaration of failure and defeat for the (Israeli) occupation.”* \n\n**Framing & Perspective** \nThe Wall Street Journal emphasizes the geopolitical dimensions of the ceasefire, highlighting: \n- **Strategic Gains for Hamas**: The return is portrayed as a symbolic win for Hamas, undermining Israeli efforts to restrict movement and assert control. \n- **U.S. Policy Rejection**: Returnees’ actions are framed as a rebuke of Donald Trump’s proposals to resettle Palestinians in Egypt or Jordan. \n- **Fragility of Ceasefire**: Notes unresolved tensions, such as disputes over hostage releases and the risk of renewed conflict. \nThe tone balances humanitarian narratives (e.g., emotional reunions) with security-focused analysis (e.g., Hamas’s armed presence during returns). \n\n**Source URL**: https://www.wsj.com/articles/palestinians-flock-back-to-northern-gaza-on-foot-after-hostage-release-breakthrough-3f60e2db\n\"\"\"\n\nReturn a JSON object with this exact structure:\n{\n  \"summary\": \"2-3 sentence summary of how these sources portray israel\",\n  \"terms\": [\n    {\"label\": \"key term or concept\", \"centrality\": 0.9, \"description\": \"one-sentence definition in context of israel\"}\n  ],\n  \"claims_or_findings\": [\"concise finding or claim\"],\n  \"citations\": [\n    {\n      \"url\": \"https://...\",\n      \"title\": \"source title\",\n      \"publisher\": \"publisher or outlet\",\n      \"date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD or YYYY\",\n      \"quote_or_snippet\": \"short quote or paraphrase (<=25 words if quote)\",\n      \"relevance\": \"why this supports a claim or term\",\n      \"source_type\": \"peer-reviewed|preprint|gov/ngo|major journalism|blog/opinion|social|reference|computational|api|wolfram\",\n      \"supporting_terms\": [\"term label 1\", \"term label 2\"]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"confidence_notes\": \"brief notes on uncertainty and limits\"\n}\n\nRules:\n- Include 8-10 terms directly relevant to \"israel\" as understood by Ctr-Right\n- \"centrality\" is 0.0-1.0, where 1.0 means absolutely central\n- Provide 3-6 claims_or_findings\n- If web grounding is OFF, return an empty citations array and note limitations in confidence_notes\n- Keep citations concise; do not fabricate URLs\n- Every term and claim MUST trace back to something explicitly stated in the source material above\n- Use quote_or_snippet to include a short verbatim excerpt from the source that supports each citation\n- Do not introduce concepts absent from the sources\n- Respond with only the JSON object",

But I should mention three names of people who offered \ninvaluable help with respect to other aspects of completing this piece of work; I \nam indebted to Dr Marina Williamson for her generous and dedicated support. \nShe kindly edited the whole thesis. I have also enjoyed the intellectual dialogue \nI had with my intelligent friend, Dr Barbara Heisserer, when I was developing \nthe first proposal for the thesis. I have had few chances to see and interact with \nProfessor Shlomo Sand but his remarks and his books, ‘The Invention of the \nJewish People’ in particular, were a supreme source of information and \ninspiration for my thesis.\nI was fortunate in having so many generous people around who were ready to \nhelp; I should mention and thank Mr Afzal Hasan, Subject Librarian in the \nForum Library of Exeter University, Jim Jackson, St Luke’s Library Supervisor \nand Professor Christopher Lovett in Emporia State University. This is a chance \nalso to thank the staff of several libraries I have visited and used to complete \nmy thesis; St Luke's Library, the Forum Library, SOAS Library, College Lane \nLibrary in the University of Hertfordshire, and Amir Al Momenin Mosque Library \nin Tehran. I am also thankful to The Open Library for the services I have \nreceived online. The Staff in the Institute of the Arab and Islamic Studies and \nSSIS Graduate Research School in Streatham were more than helpful, a \nkindness which I am thankful for.\nI had the privilege of knowing wonderful friends during this journey who were a \ngreat source of help in one way or another.

There is no chance to name all of them but I am very \ngrateful for having their friendship and treasured support. \nThe main support for my efforts to research and write this thesis came from my \nfamily. They were with me before anyone else, and all the way from the \nbeginning to the end, and in the most difficult phases. My father was a main \nsupporter.

It also raises \nmuch controversy in the academic community. The Western support for Israel, \na key factor in Israel’s survival, is a significant feature of this issue. It has been \nrevealed, through preceding studies, that Western policies towards Israel, \nforeign human rights policy for instance, are biased. The West appears biased, \nalso, in what it produces about the question. Western products in the cinema \nand the mass media examined in this regard.\nHow knowledge produced in the West is influenced by the pro-Israeli \nenvironment has been an academic concern. No empirical investigation, at the \nsame time, has been made into how academic knowledge at university level \ntreats the Israel/Palestine question. The popular belief about the scientific and \nimpartial characteristics of Western knowledge has probably contributed to such \na state of affairs.\nA sample of the most popular college level textbooks on the history of the \nIsrael/Palestine question has been selected, through an extensive survey, to \nrepresent relevant Western knowledge. The selected textbooks have been \nanalysed through a method of ‘Historical Narrative Analysis’ against a \nZionist/pro-Israeli structure of Israel’s history.\nThe immediate context of the histories produced, the relevant historians and \ntheir background, are analysed to answer the second part of the key question of \nthe research: ‘How the knowledge of history of the Israel/Palestine question is \npresented in Western academia, and why it has been presented in that \nparticular way’.\nThe results of the first analysis, a textbook analysis, support the claim that \ntextbook knowledge on the question is mainly pro-Israeli in bias. In relation to \nthe question “why”, the analysis offers the ‘Jewish pro-Israeli producer’ as the \nmain factor that can explain that bias in the products. Another factor is identified \nin this analysis as well; the relevant knowledge has been produced in a certain, \nAmerican or Israeli, national and educational environment.\n6 | P a g e\nKeywords: Israel; Palestine; history of Israel; pro-Israeli; textbook analysis; the \nWest; academic knowledge\n7 | P a g e\nTable of Contents\nAbstract........................................................................................................................................ 5\nList of Tables............................................................................................................................... 9\nPreface....................................................................................................................................... 10\nIntroduction................................................................................................................................ 13\nKey Figures of the Research.................................................................................. 15\n1.

| P a g e\nPreface\nI doubt that my fascination with the Israel/Palestine question can be an \naccident. I began life the same day that Israel finalized its occupation of \nhistorical Palestine. I have learnt this from my ID card, where 10 June 1967 is \nregistered as my birth date.\nI may have no recollection of that day in the sixties, but I can remember my \nchildhood in the seventies when I read everything to hand about this question, \nmostly in newspapers. I was forbidden, then, to read them as my school grades \nbegan to decline due to this obsession. The only way to follow this passion was \nby buying, in secret, cheap newspapers, that I could afford, and smuggling them \nto an isolated corner at home where I could read them far from my parents’ \nwatchful eyes.\nIt was during these days that Iran began its transformation from a pro-Western \nmonarchy to a pro-Palestinian republic; the very first event of this revolution \ntook place only a few meters from my primary school, Daryush, in Qom. But it \nwas my work in The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, much later in my life, that \nafforded me the first opportunity to engage intellectually with the Israel/Palestine \nquestion. Early in my career at the Ministry I saw how everything that happened \nin the Middle East is affected by this question. Above all, what engaged me to \nthe point of obsession was the paradox of how Western countries, the same \ncountries which have established the widest and most influential civilization in \nhistory in all its post-Renaissance magnificence - its modern education, \nknowledge, democracy, rule of law and human rights in particular - could at the \nsame time support such a terrible regime as that in Israel, a fundamental source \nof so much of the crime and misery that exists in the Middle East.\nThe first chance to experience, directly, this question occurred when I \nparticipated in the 40th Graduate Study Program (GSP) of the United Nations \nOffice in Geneva in 2002. Many young college graduates came to this program, \nmost of them from Western countries. The participants had to prepare a report \non the main international issues, including human rights, as part of their duties \nin the course. This was an opportunity to raise the Israel/Palestine question. I \nwrote a statement about the racist aspect of Zionism, in line with the NGOs’ \nposition in the Durban Conference to Combat Racism (2001), and followed the \n11 | P a g e\ndrafting of this document from the form it took in the original team we had on \nhuman rights issues up through various levels, to that presented to the plenary \nsession. The statement found its way finally into the concluding report of the \nProgram but the way it was treated showed how the West can be different from \nwhat I expected it to be, when it comes to Israel.\nThe same impression struck me when I made a similar contribution to the Fifth \nAnnual Course on Arms Control and National Security (2003) in The Geneva \nCentre for Security Policy (GCSP). Several lecturers came to this course to \nencourage the participants, all of them from Arab countries or Iran, to support a \npolicy of disarmament. The possibly rash comments I made in the closing \nsession about the dangers of such a unilateral policy in the absence of a similar \npolicy in Israel began to look like committing an unforgivable sin. I am not still \nsure if this is related to the fact that, against all promises made, I have not \nreceived the course certificate, but this was, for sure, another event that made \nme aware of just how a critical view of Israel will be received in the West, a \nreception which might seem to be at odds with the main characteristics of \nWestern civilization.\nThese experiences, and similar ones, such as that at the International Annual \nCourse of the United Nations University in Tokyo (2006), for instance, \nconvinced me that conducting research on this topic, and contributing to a \ndialogue with Western societies about this anomaly might be the best \ncontribution I could make to a better relationship between the West and the \nMiddle East.\nOne of several attempts to apply for a PhD program was accepted by the \nNational University of Ireland, Galway (NUIG). I put forward an original proposal \nto conduct a comparative investigation into EU human rights policy towards \nsome Middle Eastern countries including Iran and Israel, to demonstrate how \nthe West, the EU in this case, ignores its own values and principles when it \ncomes to Israel.\nMy path to further study didn’t go according to expectation, and I had to \nsacrifice a lot, including my job in the Ministry, to save my studies. The study in \nIreland itself didn’t go well for different reasons. I learned, however, one \nsignificant lesson while struggling with my PhD project; the Western bias \n12 | P a g e\ntowards Israel is not limited to governments and politicians. More importantly, \nWestern knowledge, the most respected part of Western civilization to my mind, \nis corrupted as well. This became obvious when governing textbooks in \nWestern academia on the Israel/Palestine question were consulted in order to \nacquire the essential knowledge needed to inform my academic investigation.\nThis, I thought, is a much more significant subject for investigation with \nreference to Western pro-Israeli bias. This realisation coincided with my first \nencounter with Professor Ilan Pappé, who came to Dublin to speak about the \nIsraeli attack on Gaza in 2008-9. A link to this talk in Trinity College Dublin had \nbeen sent to me by Tommy Donnellan, a well-known pro-Palestinian activist in \nGalway on 16 February 2009 at 21:39 when I was in the empty PhD room in \nNUIG. This email provided an unprecedented moment for me, not because I \nremained at my desk, in the campus, till midnight to watch the video twice, and \nnot for forwarding it to almost all my English speaking contacts, but for the novel \nfeeling I experienced, embedded in the subject of the forwarded email: ‘I can \nlove an Israeli, thank God!’\nThe days after this encounter were spent in reading about this Israeli scholar \nand his work on the question, and in process of my exploration I found his email \naddress. This address provided a chance for me to express my ideas to him, \nand to ask for his supervision. The present thesis is a product of his welcoming \nreply, and represents the subsequent transformation in my research topic under \nhis guidance.\n13 | P a g e\nIntroduction\nThe question of Israel/Palestine, as an issue, occupies a significant position in \nworld politics. For decades now, daily news about this question constitutes a \npersistent part of the world headlines. No other controversial topic has probably \nreached such a position. Another important topic, which should be seen in \ntandem with this one, is the support Israel has received from the West. \nAlongside the news about current affairs, which often illustrates the different \nbehaviour of Western countries towards Israel, the history of Israel, also, \nintroduces a wealth of facts which refer to the momentous contribution of the \nWest in helping the realization of Zionist objectives in Palestine, including the \nestablishment of a Jewish state (see for instance Lewan 1975; Bain 1979; \nBercuson 1985; Pappe 1988; Mulhall 1995; Mendes 2009)\nThis important support, which has been suggested as one of two main factors \ncontributing to the survival of Israel, together with its military superiority to its \nArab neighbours (Kermani 2006), has been elaborated by a number of \nresearchers through different academic disciplines including History, \nInternational Relations, Politics, International Law, Economics, Mass Media and \nCinema (see for instance Feldman 1984; Reich 1984; Organski 1990; Ben-Zvi \n1993; Findley 1993; Pipes and Daniel 1997; Chomsky 1999; Allin and Simon \n2003; Merkley 2004; E. L. Stephens 2004; Gvosdev 2006; Petras 2006; E. \nStephens 2006; Mearsheimer and Walt 2008; Roth 2009; Cronin 2011; \nShaheen 2009). Various explanations have emerged from the findings of this \nbody of research, which answer the question of why the West treats the issue in \nthe particular way it does, by introducing some influential factors such as \nnational interests, economic interests, security considerations, strategic \ninterests, European guilt over and moral responsibility for a history of Jewish \nmassacres in Europe, or the influence of the Israel lobby in Western countries.\nA significant matter of fact which has emerged during the conduct of this \ninvestigation is that the relevant literature explored on Western support of Israel, \nshows very little sign of tackling the subject through an empirical analysis into \nthe academic treatment itself of the Israel/Palestine question. This area, like \nother areas of the Western treatment of Israel, could be a platform from which \n14 | P a g e\nforces that operate in other areas might attain such a biased position. Here one \nquestion can guide the research: Is there a legitimate ground for establishing \nthe same idea of Western support for Israel, this time, in the way that \nknowledge is produced about the question? In other words, is the knowledge \nproduced in the West about the question influenced by pro-Israeli forces that \nwork in other areas? An investigation into this extension of the field could be \nfascinating in its own right but it is important, also, due to the role Western \nknowledge plays in the world in general, and in establishing the dominant \nscientific paradigms in particular.\nThis study is designed to explore this matter through an empirical investigation \nof college textbooks which are used to teach the history of Israel/Palestine in \nWestern higher education. As an original research topic, which can deal with a \nconsiderable gap in the relevant literature, it entails two main characteristics \nwhich suggest it is fascinating enough to be studied as a PhD research topic:\n1. It deals with a significant controversy which exists concerning the \nWestern countries’ position on Israel. This position appears as a matter that \nseparates the West from the rest of the world in many areas, specifically in \nworld politics. A quick look at the pattern of the votes of Western countries in \nthe UN General Assembly on issues related to Israel can illustrate this (Gilman \n2000, 15).\n2. Another matter which differentiates the West from the rest of the world is \nthe Western attitude towards knowledge and scientific research. It is contended \nthat one main element that contributed heavily to establishing the very nature of \nthe West, as a modern civilisation, providing it with a chance to present itself as \na different and developed part of the world, is rooted in its relatively effective \nefforts to detach knowledge from other considerations, religious and political. \nFrom this perspective any possibility of Western failure in that line when dealing \nwith one area of knowledge could be an interesting and important topic to study. \n15 | P a g e\nKey Figures of the Research:\nKey figures of this research that include ‘the research problem’, ‘the statement \nof purpose’, ‘the main question of the research’, and ‘limitations of the study’ are \npresented as follows:\n1. The Research Problem: Western support of Israel influenced not only \nthe Israel/Palestine question and the wider Middle East but also has \naffected Western societies as well. There are a number of scholars who \nsuggest that this support came at the cost of undermining some Western \nvalues/standards including promoting international human rights where \nthe West systematically ignores how Israel treats the norms of \ninternational law and universal human rights. This research is concerned \nabout a possibility of an extension of such a problem to Western \nknowledge. Knowledge is perceived as the foundation of Western \ncivilization, and any impact that a supportive position towards Israel \nmight have on knowledge production in the West is considered a major \nissue. This also can have a global resonance, as Western knowledge is \nin a position to play a crucial role in determining the dominant paradigm \non a global scale. On another level, the supportive treatment of Israel by \nWestern knowledge can contribute to producing pro-Israeli public opinion \nin Western societies. This translates into policies, including foreign \npolicy, in democracies. It might explain, thus, different Western policy \nwith regard to the Israel/Palestine question. The evident division between \nthe Western countries and other members of the international community \non this question can contribute to the widening of the gap between the \nWest and the rest of the world. Western policy on the question has an \nenormous capacity to affect the relationship between the West and those \ncountries in the South that suffer, directly, from supportive Western \npolicies, Middle Eastern countries in particular. The supportive nature of \nthe Western treatment of Israel has not been fully recognised yet. This is \nevident, more, in the European section of Western countries. The main \nreason for this European problem comes from the fact that they compare \nthe slightly more limited degree of support for Israel in their policies to the \nodd and unparalleled position which the US takes towards Israel. The \nother countries are not counted as significant when one makes such a \n16 | P a g e\ncomparison. This textbook analysis might add something to the literature \nby helping to recognize the biased and problematic nature of Western \ntreatment of Israel in general. The data and evidence produced in this \nanalysis might have the capacity to demonstrate that the cost has risen\nvery high where the quality of Western knowledge is concerned, the very \nfoundation of Western advancement and progress.\n2. Statement of Purpose: The purpose of this study is to analyse the \ntextbook knowledge provided by Western academia in the field of the \nquestion’s history to find out how the history of the Israel/Palestine \nquestion is narrated: is this Western production pro-Israeli like many \nother Western productions such as movies and news; does related \nknowledge determined by pro-Israeli forces that dominate in the West \nand influence other areas such as the mass media and cinema, or \nstudied knowledge, demonstrate that pro-Israeli forces have failed to \nmake a dominant impact in the area of academic knowledge? In a critical \ninvestigation to advance such a purpose, I have analysed textbook \nknowledge against the pro-Israeli stance on the history of the question, \nand tried to explore why this knowledge is produced in that particular\nway.\n3. The Research Question: This examination is undertaken into how\nknowledge on the history of the Israel/Palestine question is presented in \nWestern academia, and why it has been presented in that particular way.\n4. Limitations of the Study: This study is limited in the following ways:\n What has been studied in this research, the textbook, is one main \nfund of knowledge. When knowledge is at stake there are other \nmajor sources, encyclopaedia and journal articles in particular, \nthat have not been taken into account in this study,\n A limited number of textbooks, 6 in total, are selected in this study \nto represent Western textbooks. Analysing a bigger number of \nrelated textbooks or all of them can overcome this limitation, but it \nis beyond the capacity of a thesis of PhD size. \n17 | P a g e\n Syllabi of the related courses, and their reading lists, are used as \na main source of information about textbook adoption but only \nonline syllabi are used, due to practical reasons, for that purpose.\n Different languages are used as the language of instruction in \ndifferent Western universities. This research was limited to \ntextbooks that are taught in an English-speaking environment,\n The time limit used in this research, represents only contemporary \nWestern universities (from the year 2000 onwards), and not any \nother periods of time,\nMethodology:\nIn this section, the main elements of the methodological foundation of the \nresearch are presented: this is done through explaining the method used, the \ncritical nature of the research and how the textbook sample is selected.\n1. Method Used: There are various ways that textbooks are analysed. The \none used, as the central method, in this research is ‘historical narrative \nanalysis’. This method, in comparison to others, has a competitive \ncapacity to provide a platform for an analysis that can capture the key \nelements of an historical subject: historical narrative analysis is \nconcerned primarily with how a history is narrated or how the main story \nis told; how the story begins and where it ends, the sequence of events; \nwhat is mentioned; what is omitted; what is emphasized or what is \nundermined and other matters that are related to the very central \nconcepts of the story that a history is developed for (Pearcy 2011, 60–\n61). In this sense, this method can be regarded as a main method of\ntextbook examination that analyses factors which constitute the principal\nelements of a given history. The main objective of a (historical) narrative \nanalysis, why the story is told in the way it is (Bloor and Wood 2006, 119 \n–121), provides an analytical tool to answer the main question of this \nresearch which is concerned with why Western textbooks narrate the \nhistory of Israel/Palestine in the way they do. Narrative, according to \n18 | P a g e\nEsterberg (2002, 182) is the telling of the story or the telling of what really \nhappened. There is a reason that the telling is formulated in a particular \nway. A narrative analysis has the capacity to reveal such reasons. This \nprovides a noticeable chance for the researcher to investigate how \npowerful elites, for instance, work to impact on historical knowledge, an \nimpact that can distort or corrupt history through different ways, including \nomission or different treatments of facts and myths. There are other PhD \nprojects that have used historical narrative analysis, in one way or \nanother, to organize a textbook analysis. The following are the most \nrecent ones:\n ‘We Have Never Known What Death Was Before: A Just War\nDoctrine Critique of U.S. History Textbooks’ (Pearcy 2011)\n ‘Hegemony and History: A Critical Analysis of How High School \nHistory Text Books Depict Key Events of the Vietnam War’ \n(Leahey 2007)\nThe first research is an analysis of US history secondary-level textbooks, \nfocusing on how the US Civil War is conceptualized and presented. ‘How do \ntextbooks present the Civil War, in light of the doctrine of a “just war”?’ \n(Pearcy 2011, 8) is the main question of this research. The research is \ninformed by Leahy’s thesis on how an historical narrative analysis can be \napplied.\n2. The Critical Nature of the Research: Critical research is a popular \nfashion in textbook studies. Critical researchers adopt different \napproaches when engaged in a critical analysis. This makes clarification \nan indispensable job. One version is present where a debate between \nconservative and progressive approaches in education exists. It is \nestablished, in the relevant literature, that there are two opposing forces \nworking to exert influence on educational instruction; one, conservative, \ntries to ensure that the next generation, now students, are loyal to what \npast generations subscribe to through textbooks that advocate a \nconsensus and the status quo. The other, the progressive, is not happy \nwith the current situation and perceives it as unjust. There is also an \n19 | P a g e\nassumption that all textbooks constructed under such circumstances \nhave been developed with the goal of safeguarding the governing power \nrelation which secures the interests of the dominant class. To have a \nbetter future, the progressive front advocates a commitment to working \nfor a transformation that overthrows the existing power relation. For the \nanalysts of this camp a critical textbook analysis is the one that serves \nsuch a goal through revealing the crucial conflict between the powerful \nand powerless, and the impact of the powerful on textbook knowledge. \nThis is seen as necessary for emancipating textbook readers from \nunconscious subscription to ideas that serve the powerful, and \nempowering them with an awareness that allows an effective resistance \nto the hegemony exercised through textbook knowledge. Here the \ntextbook is seen as a battlefield where the main political forces of a given \nsociety, forces that come from powerful as well as powerless classes, \nare fighting to occupy a better position. The textbook is described as a \npolitical text from this perspective. Power and political conflict are the \nmain centre of interest when a textbook is analysed in this fashion (Pinar \n1995 Chapter 5: Understanding Curriculum as Political Text). A relative \navoidance of the role truth plays, as a governing value in knowledge is \nevident in this sense of critical investigation.\nIn addition, there is another consideration that should be taken into account; \nthe main ideas that form the above - mentioned debate between \nconservative and progressive analysts come from a standpoint that views \nthe ‘schools’ (primary or secondary) as the main field of education. Colleges \nand universities are hardly in view from this standpoint. The difference \nbetween school and college, and between school student and college \nstudent, school textbook and college textbook, is evident in so many areas. \nThis provides another reason for this research to keep some distance from \nwhat is significant from an observation of school education. This research \nhas not been designed to take a critical position in this sense. A strong \ncommitment towards a political cause that plays a dominant role, at the \nexpense of truth, might disrupt the key analysis of this research that revolves \naround what truly happened in the real world (History of Israel).\n20 | P a g e\nAt the same time, the researcher is inspired by ideas advocated by \nprogressive researchers; they can be valid goals, in particular, when the \nissue concerns choosing a topic to analyse, but he is not convinced about \ntaking such a commitment when it concerns producing knowledge where \nexploring truth is a central value. It is believed in this research that \nknowledge is/should be the main goal when the activity is scientific analysis. \nIt is true that social factors, power and money in particular, interfere where \nthere is a related interest. This is a reality but not necessarily legitimate, as \nthis interference has the capacity to corrupt knowledge to the extent that it \nloses its main quality, representation of reality. The research undertaken in \nthe present thesis is concerned with the corruption in a given area of \nknowledge, where pro-Israeli power interests operate, and not with \nexamining the main qualities of the knowledge under any additional \ncommitment to other values, including that of a better and just future. Here \nan investigation that makes such influence visible for a wider audience is \nseen as the main/valid way to emancipate students or empower the \npowerless. This is achievable if a corrupted body of knowledge has been \nchosen for an investigation that can reveal the evidence of a given \ncorruption. This can be done without a deliberate commitment to values \nother than truth when investigation is being conducted; such commitments \nmight provide a different ground for corrupting knowledge as a value system\ncomes to govern the investigation with no loyalty to truth - centric \nknowledge. Hence, this research can be considered a critical one in the \nfollowing senses:\nI. Considering the social context (Western support of Israel) in order to \nanalyse and understand a Western social product i.e. textbook knowledge, \nII. Entailing a sensitivity to the role (pro-Israeli) power plays in social \nprocesses, including knowledge construction,\nIII. Comparing textbook knowledge with what ought to be in a Habermasian \nsense, where telling the truth is in the centre of an ‘ideal speech’ (For more \ninformation about this see Roderick 1986),\n21 | P a g e\n3. Selecting the Sample: A selection procedure is needed to form a list of \ntextbooks to analyse. This research, like many others, hopes to find a \nreliable way to select the most popular textbooks in the field. This is \nnecessary, as a selected group should have the capacity to represent the \nwider field, that of college level textbooks on the subject. Textbook \nanalysts have applied different strategies to access required \ninformation/statistics about textbook popularity. Their experiences \nsuggest that this is not an easy job in general but it appears to be more \ndifficult when it is about college - level textbooks. Publishers, in general, \nare not willing to reveal the information they have in this regard (Wills \n1992, 64). Business considerations, as one influential factor, make them \nvery reluctant to do so. But there are places where some information \nabout this subject can be accessed. The American Textbook Council is \none known to many textbook researchers; it provides a list of ‘Widely \nAdopted History Textbooks’ in American schools, which can be consulted \neasily through its website (“American Textbook Council - Widely Adopted \nHistory Textbooks” 2013). \nIn relation to college level textbooks, analysts’ statements suggest that there \nis not such a ready list of popular textbooks (Wills 1992, 65). What is \ndesigned in this research to access such information is an online facility that \ncan provide a novel and effective chance for doing this. For this purpose it is \nplanned to collect as many cases as possible of ‘reading lists’ that college \nlecturers provide to students as recommended sources of knowledge on the \nhistory of Israel/Palestine. A survey will be conducted to find and extract \n‘reading lists’ that are provided by teachers of the relevant modules. There is \na chance now to find these lists online where college websites provide such \ninformation for their students. The final stage of the selection procedure \nstarts when reading lists are collected; a calculation is needed here to \ndetermine which books are recommended most often by the subject \nteachers. This forms a list of the most used/recommended textbooks on the \nsubject that might have the power to represent Western textbooks on the \nquestion. \n22 | P a g e\nThe Structure of the Research:\nHere, where the Introduction ends, is a proper place to outline what comes next \nin this thesis. The Introduction, as has just been elaborated, introduces some \nessentials of the academic research including methodology and key figures of \nthis study. Having that established, the remaining parts of this thesis will be \ndivided into five chapters: relevant theoretical points are made in the first \nchapter; the ‘relevant literature’ will be reviewed in the second one. The relevant \nliterature, in this research, includes all textbook analyses that investigate, \nentirely or partly, the textbook treatments of the Israel/Palestine question. The \nthird chapter is dedicated to explaining the survey that was conducted to find \nthe most adopted textbooks in the Western universities chosen as focus (those \nin English- speaking countries). The actual analysis of the selected textbooks \ntakes place in the fourth chapter. This analysis determines how the selected \ntextbook knowledge treats the history of the Israel/Palestine question. In the \nnext chapter, Chapter Five, the immediate context of the produced knowledge, \nthat of the producers, is investigated with an aim to providing some insights into \nthe background of those who have manufactured the dominant knowledge on \nthe Israel/Palestine question in Western academia. The thesis will end with a \nconclusion that includes some concluding remarks.\n23 | P a g e\nChapter 1: Theoretical Foundation\nThis research is located in the realm of two main theories: the first one is a \npolitical theory about the nature of the special relationship between the West \nand Israel. This general theory, articulated by a number of experts in Middle \nEastern affairs, including Edward Said, Noam Chomsky and Ilan Pappe, among \nothers, is elaborated in the Introduction. The first analysis of the research, the \ntextbook analysis, is situated where this theory is applicable. The second theory \nis a theory of historiography that concerns the relationship between narrative \nand narrator, between histories and their producers, historians. This theory \nviews history from the standpoint of the role the historian plays in the related \nconstruction. According to this theory, the principal structure of a history and its \nmain message/themes originate in the main tendencies/characters of the\nhistorian. Hence, the historian’s background plays a vital role in the history s/he \nproduces. In this way, the difference between histories of a given historical \nevent can be explained by the differences between the backgrounds of its \nhistorians. The second analysis of the research, analysing the historians’ \nbackground, is informed by this theory. The theory is elaborated later, in \nChapter 5, where the related analysis is undertaken.\nThere are other theoretical points, in the following section, that have been \nincluded for their capacity to establish general notions and ideas that make this \nresearch possible, justifiable and understandable.\nThe Textbook:\nThe textbook in a general sense was present as a main tool of education from \nthe very early past (Venezky 1992, 452). There were certain books which \nplayed a central role in teaching and learning in the then educational \ninstitutions. ‘Golestan’ a classic Persian text written by the popular Iranian poet, \nSaadi, could be named as one example in the East. Shakespeare’s plays had a \nsimilar function in the West (Buckingham 1960, 1517). Quran and the Bible, as \nwell, could be counted as textbooks in this sense. \n24 | P a g e\nThe textbook in the modern sense started to appear in the 1830s in the West \nwhen the name itself was used for such educational materials in English \n(McCulloch 2004, 78). In this sense, textbooks were materials designed to \nsupport teaching and learning in the classrooms of the new schools or colleges \n(McCulloch 2004, 78). The obvious purpose of the design of the book for the \nsake of achieving a specific educational goal in a given subject area, \ndistinguishes modern textbooks from their old counterparts (Hamilton 1990). \nGolestan, Quran or the Bible were not designed or written to serve such a \npurpose. \nThe significant role of textbooks, as an effective tool for teaching in an \neducational system raised interest in the topic on the part of other forces in \nsociety outside education. It was quickly realised that this can also function as \nan effective instrument to transfer ideas, beliefs or ideologies to pupils and \nstudents (McCulloch 2004, 78). In this way textbooks have been seen as a main \nmedium through which to shape the next generation, based on the ideas a \nsociety has about its future (Saha 1994, 5597; Goodlad 1994, 1262). In this \nphase, textbooks become a site where different social forces work to influence \nthe process of writing and reading in educational institutions.\nThe events at this level have led to another focus of attention concerning \ntextbooks: textbook analysis. What happened in the development outlined \nabove is that operating social forces in the process of textbook creation caught \nthe attention of many in academia where researchers are working to follow and \nunderstand social forces and their related processes. This kind of examination \nof textbooks could be divided into two main categories; one is the work of \nresearchers who are interested in the dynamic of social forces in the process of \ntextbook creation with an aim to a better understanding of textbooks and how \ntextbooks are shaped. For them the textbook itself is still the centre of their \nendeavour. There are others who find textbooks a rich resource to understand \nhow other social processes like those related to knowledge and power work in a \ngiven society. Here the textbook is a rich resource to use for studying the \ndynamic of social forces, and providing evidence about their related processes \n(Woodward 1994, 6367).\n25 | P a g e\nWhat Is A Textbook?\nA textbook is an object easy to perceive for anyone with a school background. \nAt the same time, providing a definition which includes all kinds of textbook and \nexcludes those not in this category does not appear so simple. This complexity \ncomes from different sources. A reference to a dictionary, even, can provide an \neffective place to see and define textbooks: ‘a book of instruction and study that \npresents the subject matter of teaching, as prescribed by the curriculum, in a \nmanner appropriate to the subject and to educational principles; this also means \nthat it is in keeping with accepted theories of learning and that, besides \nproviding factual information, it points toward individual learning’ (Bamberger \n1992, 116). This definition indicates that there are clear elements attached to a \ntextbook which help in recognizing such a medium. In reality this does not work \nin all situations. There are some reasons for this; first of all the very name of the \nmedium is contested. There is another term, ‘schoolbook’, which was used in \nsome places and historical periods (see McCulloch and Crook 2008, 598 for \ninstance).\nAnother source of complexity which is related to the name again comes from \nthe term ‘textbook’, itself. In a number of cases books have this term in their \ntitle. ‘Textbook on International Law’ (Dixon 2007) could be mentioned as one \nexample. But this title, itself, does not give the book a status as such; if a book \nwith such a title has not been used for such a purpose in educational institutions \nit might not be regarded as a textbook in fact. Besides this, if a book without \nsuch a title plays a role consistent with roles textbooks are expected to play, this \nprovides a legitimate ground for it to have enough credit for that status.\nOther efforts in educational writings to define the textbook might help further; \nBuckingham defines it as ‘a learning instrument usually employed in schools \nand colleges to support a program of instruction (Buckingham 1960, 1517); \nLange considers it as “a standard book for any particular branch of study \n(Buckingham 1960, 1517); Francis Bacon defines the textbook as “a book \ndesigned for classroom use carefully prepared by experts in the field and \nequipped with the usual teaching devices” (Buckingham 1960, 1517). All these \nstatements define textbooks, directly or indirectly, as playing a central role in \neducation. But educational systems of different countries are very different and \n26 | P a g e\nthis fact suggests one important, if not the most important, source of complexity \nin defining the textbook. From this perspective, educational systems can be \ndelineated by a spectrum of categories with two extremes at the two poles: \ncentralised and decentralised educational systems. There are some differences \nbetween those two polar systems and among others which are in the middle, \nbut what is related to this research is the place they provide for the textbook; in \ncentralised systems the main decisions, if not all, about textbooks are taken in \nthe centre, mainly by a central national authority. What remains is use of the \nbooks as a teaching tool, which suggests the role of schools and teachers. In \nthis system the textbook has a very clear and strong position, which is valid and \nknown for all educational institutions nationwide. This enables one to make a \nclear list of them (McCulloch and Crook 2008, 598–9). On the other hand, in \ndecentralised systems, main decisions are left to be taken by local authorities, \nschools or even teachers. As a result there is no such solid classification of \ntextbooks. One book could be used as a textbook in one school or even one \nclass but not in the neighbouring one. This implies a sense of the textbook’s \nsignificance as being relatively weak, granting it a very limited validity in time, \nplace, or both (McCulloch and Crook 2008, 599).\nOne more source of complexity comes from the hierarchy of levels of education \nwithin an educational system, where education is divided into two main \ncategories; school and higher education. What gives the status to a book as a \ntextbook in higher education mainly comes from an instructor’s decision or a \nrelevant council in the university with this authority or a combination of both \n(Squire 1960, 1416; Hudec 2011).\nWith all mentioned differences and complexities that make this difficult, it is \nessential to describe textbooks in a way that covers all their kinds in general. \nThere are two descriptions that can work as such:\n1. Objective description: from this perspective textbooks are printed, hard \nbound, published in good number, and are at hand for students and instructors \nas a commonplace for educational interaction (Buckingham 1960, 1517),\n2. Subjective description: from this view textbooks are related to some main \neducational concepts: something which is designed to cover a syllabus \n27 | P a g e\n(McCulloch 2004, 78; S. Foster 2006a, xiii); its subject matter is defined by a \ncurriculum (Hudec 2011); it is used as a main source of material to teach, and \nby students as a main source of learning.\nHowever, there are two main criteria which can play a guiding role in recognition \nof a textbook of any kind, wherever it is:\n1. Usage: the wider the usage a book has in educational institutes as a \nmain source of teaching/learning, the greater the chance it has of reaching the \nstatus of a textbook (Michael 1990).\n2. Authority: textbooks always receive some recognition from the hierarchy \nin an educational system in order to have such a position. This hierarchy \nincludes national authorities and instructors.\nAll that has been suggested here about textbook definition, recognition and its \ncomplexities (for more information about this see Hamilton 1990; Michael 1990)\njustifies what Ian Michael has said in this regard; as a result his assertion on \nthis is used as a conclusion to this discussion; ‘The decision whether or not to \ntreat a publication as a textbook will have to be made for each work separately’ \n(1990).\nThe Significance of the Textbook:\nThe civilization humankind enjoys in our time is also called the ‘civilization of the \nbook’ (Buckingham 1960, 1518). Here one question could be asked for further \nclarification; which book is more important than a textbook in this regard? The \nimportance of the textbook originates in the different categories under which it \nengages in social life; the first one is related to the textbook’s role in education, \nwhere the term originally comes from. There are facts everywhere in \neducational institutes, schools and colleges, classrooms and curricula, and \nattaching to teachers and students which suggest that the textbook is a player \nwith a central role in education. It is contended that the textbook has been at the \ncentre of education throughout the latter’s history (S. Foster 2006a, xi). The \nrelevant literature, also, supports the argument that instructors rely on and \nbelieve in textbooks as “the principal source of knowledge” (S. Foster 2006b, \n28 | P a g e\n157). Students, who are the main consumers of this medium, commonly regard \na textbook’s content as ‘important’ and ‘true’. This might be contested, but there \nis evidence that ‘students reject what is offered by other sources of knowledge \nsuch as family or mass media, if there is an inconsistency with what textbooks \nprovide (S. Foster 2006a, xiii–xiv). The same source argues that what is left out \nof textbooks is considered ‘unimportant’. Textbooks occupy a dominant position \nin educational activities; one source (Airasian 1994, 793) refers to ‘up to 75 \npercent’ as a figure which represents the proportion assumed by the textbook in \nthose activities. Another reference (Tobin and Ybarra 2008, 2) prefers a higher \none: 85 to 95 percent.\nIn agreement with what has been stated above about the role of the textbook, \nthere are many references to its position as ‘dominant’ and its influence as \n‘profound’ in education (for instance Buckingham 1960, 1518; S. Foster 2006b, \n157). According to Woodward, also, many studies confirmed such a result \n(1994, 6368). The textbook appears closer than any other educational tool to \nassuming the position of determining what students learn. It contributes \nsignificantly in shaping their views about the world (S. Foster 2006a, ix). In \ndoing so, textbooks approach the position of a ‘holy book’. They place the \npresented knowledge above suspicion, as religious rituals do (Keith Crawford \n2003b, 48). This aspect of their role introduces them as a favourite site on \nwhich to create ‘official knowledge’, a term Michael Apple (S. Foster 2006a, xiii)\nused to refer to the knowledge selected by power to achieve the status of \ndominant knowledge at the expense of excluding the competing versions of \nknowledge from textbooks. All this helps to bring such attention to textbooks \nwhich is described by Rebecca Rogers (2004, 174) as having no precedent in \nthe history (of the United States).\nThe role of the textbook as a vehicle which can carry, or infiltrate, ideas, \nideologies, values and other social constructions into education and the \ncognitive area of students’ minds opens another chapter in its importance as an \neffective instrument in social or political processes or projects (Keith Crawford \n2003a). What has been mentioned above about ‘official knowledge’ has a direct \nlink with this aspect of the subject. There are other instances of this \nphenomenon; ‘Cultural reproduction’ is one clear example. If one adopts a \n29 | P a g e\nconservative position, this process can be seen from a positive perspective; \ntextbooks are used by society to reproduce cultural values or civic ideas which \ncreate the ground for the continuation of existing social patterns. In doing this, a \nsociety tries to have its next generation loyal and committed to what the society \nbelieves in the area of social and cultural life. Here the textbook has proved to \nbe a powerful tool, if not the most powerful one (Musgrave 1994, 1344–5). As a \nresult, some subjects which are related to this process, especially history, and \nthose areas related to the social sciences, are the focal point of such activities. \nThe social dimension of education is viewed in this way by some scholars, \nincluding Durkheim. But there are others who see society as a myth used to \ncover the real forces, powerful elites, of the related processes. Here cultural \nreproduction is considered a positive term for the status quo, and is a target to \nachieve because the present disposition in society secures the special benefits \nand interests that powerful elites enjoy. This allows the continuation of \ninequality in wealth or power in society. The negative implication of such a \nprocess is not limited to social matters. It also can corrupt education. Bias could \nbe counted a main issue; it has an identified role in undermining some \nfundamental principles of education and knowledge in the area of truth and \nunderstanding (Bloor and Wood 2006, 21). There are well-known types of bias \nin textbooks, which include racial, national and sexual ones (Buckingham 1960, \n1421). Influenced by these biases, students tend to look at some national \nvalues, at history, racial questions or at the sexes in a way imposed or \npromoted by biased textbooks. All these influences, although acting, \nsometimes, in different directions, work to demonstrate the important role of\ntextbooks in education and society in our time. This encourages an observer to \ncall our civilization a ‘civilization of the textbook,’ if there was any necessity to \nrefine the concept of ‘book’ in the definition ‘civilization of the book’ used at the \nbeginning of this section.\nTextbooks and Power:\nTextbooks contribute to making realities, educational and social, a fact which \nindicates their role and importance in society. From a different perspective, but \nrelated, these makers, themselves, have been made. In other words they are \n30 | P a g e\ncreated under the influence of some other forces. These forces include \neconomic, political and cultural factors, in a general sense. Although it is argued \nthat not enough investigation has been conducted to demonstrate how these \nforces work to form a textbook (S. Foster and Crawford 2006, 2), there is, at the \nsame time, some knowledge which has the power to throw a noticeable deal of \nlight on the subject.\nIt is contended that what makes textbooks is educational priorities, a claim \nmade mainly by educationalists who are engaged in producing and promoting \nthese books (Farrell and Heyneman 1994, 6365). According to them, a textbook \nis an innocent and objective source of knowledge (Romanowski 1993, 68–9). \nThis claim has been undermined repeatedly by a number of scholars who have\ninvestigated the relationship between textbooks and social forces. What makes \nthis possible, stems, mainly, from broadening the picture of textbook production \nwhere the social context of the schooling can be seen. The knowledge scholars \nglean about social context, social conflicts and the main forces involved in such \nprocesses, power and interests in particular, provides a chance for them to see \nthe root causes of the governing tendencies in textbook knowledge. Therefore, \nsocial and political factors are considered responsible, mainly or partly, for \nestablishing textbook knowledge (Farrell and Heyneman 1994, 6365; Goodlad \n1994, 1421).\nThis is supported by an argument about the principal motivation for such a \nphenomenon; the textbook is a main and effective tool for determining or \ninfluencing ‘popular memory’ (S. Foster 2006a, 4). As a result, the process of \nforming textbooks is described as a main area of political and social conflict (S. \nFoster and Crawford 2006, 2). Observations refer to an ever-present conflict of \ninterests struggling for dominance in the process of textbook formation. This \nstruggle over the content and form of the textbook itself, has the capacity to \ndemonstrate the political and social nature of the process where many political \nforces and tendencies fight to have what serves their agenda published in \ntextbooks (Edgerton 1994, 1334).\nThe struggle over education, which includes textbooks, at a national level, is \ncharacterized through two main categories:\n31 | P a g e\n1. Open systems where the content of the textbook and the decisions made \nabout that are a result of compromise among different social forces (Farrell and \nHeyneman 1994, 6365)\n2. One party system where the ruling elites design the textbook carefully \naccording to their own ideological and political positions. Here they suppress \nthe alternative and impose their own version on others (Farrell and Heyneman \n1994)\nThis issue of the influence of social forces on education attracted such attention \nthat it provided enough space for an important topic in Sociology: Sociology of \nEducation. A considerable number of prominent scholars studied this area and \nmade some important points; Durkheim argued that “education was an \neminently social matter” (Saha 1994, 5597). He contended that “no aspect of \neducation can be understood without taking into account the social forces and \nconsequences which characterize it” (Saha 1994, 5597). “Marx believed that \neducation was a way of imposing a dominant ideology on members of society, \nparticularly the working classes, so that they would accept, and not question, \ntheir position in society” (Saha 1994, 5597). Althusser, a French Marxist, called \nthis ‘symbolic violence’ when it is compared with the physical or oppressive \nversion exerted by police or military forces (Saha 1994, 5597). These scholars, \nalso some others who came later, laid the stress on education as a tool for \n‘social control’ (Saha 1994, 5597). This includes thinkers with a positive view of \nthe social aspect of education, such as Weber, who believed this control is \nexerted to promote ‘an appropriate way of life’ (Saha 1994, 5597).\nIn addition to what has been offered about education (and its relation to its \nsocial context) in general, textbooks, in particular, became a major concern in \nthis area of study: Pierre Bourdieu, a pioneer who emphasised the role of \npowerful elites, considered textbook knowledge as the knowledge of the \ngoverning elites that was legitimized through education, to secure and maintain \nthe interests of the powerful elites in a society. This knowledge works as capital, \n‘symbolic capital’ as he named it, for elites, which affect the distribution of \ncapital to economic levels in an unequal way. He regarded school knowledge as \nan ideology that misrepresents social reality and reproduces existing power \nrelations (Dorliae 1998, 8). Emile Durkheim who investigated how the contents \n32 | P a g e\nof French secondary school textbooks developed from the seventeenth century \nto the early nineteenth, suggested that textbooks represent the interests of the \nupper class of society, in his case, the catholic church (Dorliae 1998, 7–8). \nRaymond Williams undertook a similar task in the United Kingdom; his \ninvestigation of educational materials demonstrated the influence of competing \nforces in the then British society (Dorliae 1998, 7–8). Studies conducted by \nBernstein and Young, also, support the judgment that British school textbooks \nserve the interests of powerful groups in society (Dorliae 1998, 22). Michael \nApple suggested similar ideas about American textbooks. On the basis of his \nanalysis of these textbooks he emphasised the role that ‘form’ and ‘selection \ntradition’ play in the employment of textbooks by dominant groups (Dorliae \n1998, 22). All this is related to a topical scholarship that is known these days as \nthe relationship between ‘knowledge and power’.\nKnowledge and Power:\nThe intimate relationship between ‘knowledge and power’ as an intellectual \nconception became common when Michel Foucault offered his ideas on this \nsubject. In this section, the discussion of knowledge and power is designed to \nintroduce some relevant thoughts about knowledge and its main repository, the\ntextbook, where there is a relation to power. The main ways in which power is \nexercised are reviewed next with an emphasis on how knowledge is employed \nfor such a purpose. What Foucault means by knowledge and power is \nelaborated next, before I present how this concept informs this research.\nThe textbook as knowledge: Knowledge, as a cognitive condition, has no \napparent realization in the visible or accessible world but there are real objects \nin that world that have enough capacity or legitimacy to represent knowledge; \nencyclopaedia articles, journal articles and textbooks can be regarded as the \nmain ones (Myers 1991). In this sense they are seen as a ‘fund’ or ‘store’ which \none can visit or in which one can access knowledge. The textbook, in this \nrelation, is considered as the best such medium; ‘by means of books knowledge \nis accumulated into a permanently available store or fund: and of all books, \ntextbooks are the best instruments for such funding’ (Buckingham 1960, 1517). \nOther ideas, such as that promoted by Sharon Traweek (1988), for instance, \n33 | P a g e\ntake textbooks as an instrument which represents ‘constraints on scientific \nthought’ (Myers 1991). Thomas Kuhn who views the whole of human \nknowledge through different paradigms appreciates the textbook as ‘the visible \nform of paradigms’ (Myers 1991). The distinct link established between \nknowledge and the textbook through such statements is challenged in one way; \nthere is not enough room here for the sceptical positions readers take once they \nencounter the textbook as an authority, if knowledge is assumed to equate with \nwhat is written in a textbook. This point can be justified by and explains the \nprogress human knowledge has experienced throughout its long history of \ngradual or revolutionary development (Myers 1991). This can work against any \nassertion which contains a sense of extending the status of ‘representation’ \ntowards that of ‘equality with actuality’. At the same time, it does not work as an \nargument which undermines representation per se. This, also, might not \ndestabilise the power of textbooks to function as knowledge from a sociological \nperspective.\nThere are reasons that can explain different qualities of representation when \ndifferent materials are at stake; journal articles tend to represent knowledge in a \nmore temporal and personal sense whereas an encyclopaedia, in this regard, \nhas a better chance of being judged a permanent and impersonal \nrepresentation (Myers 1991). These two both play a passive role in representing \nknowledge from one perspective; they are there, like a book on a library shelf, \nto be consulted if one is willing to. The textbook is different from them in this \nregard. It has the authority to communicate knowledge to the receiver \nregardless of her/his willingness. That might be a reason, also, that their \nlocation in a library, when in the ‘reserve’ section, is different from that of other \nlibrary items. This special position of the textbook is related to its role in \neducation, where educational authorities play a determinative role in what \nstudents consult as the ‘valid’ source of knowledge. For this reason, Michael \nApple appears right in calling ‘official knowledge’ what the textbook represents \n(S. Foster 2006a, xiii). As elaborated in the last section, ‘The Importance of \nTextbooks’, textbook knowledge is considered widely as the main source for \nstudents to learn from or trust in school or university. Those sources and the \narguments they provide, support the significant position that textbooks occupy, \nas a main source of knowledge, in a school or college.\n34 | P a g e\nThomas Kuhn contributed, further, to this discussion through his reflection on \nthe knowledge-text relationship, providing a valuable insight into the different \nroles textbooks play in mediating knowledge in different academic disciplines. \nHe classifies all disciplines in three categories from this standpoint; in one \ncategory, mainly Graphic Arts and Music, textbooks play only a secondary role. \nThe first role here is reserved for the artistic product itself, whether it is a \npainting or a piece of music. At the opposite end of the spectrum, Natural \nSciences assume a very robust position for the textbook in this regard. The \ntextbook, here, is the main medium which represents relevant knowledge. The \noriginal sources of knowledge, the works of Newton or Einstein for instance, \nusually have no significant role to play here. Then there is another category \nwhich occupies a place in the middle; in the social sciences and history, the \ntextbook plays a primary role in transmitting knowledge but it is usually \naccompanied by some excerpts from original works such as the ‘Declaration of \nIndependence’ or ‘Emile’ by Rousseau. These materials are needed as a \ntextbook companion to allow a ‘comprehensive’ representation of related \nknowledge (Jackson 1992, 442–3). Here the textbook, comparable to those in \nthe Natural Sciences, is a prime source of knowledge, but its position is \ndifferent, in that the textbook is not the only source. Original works play a role in \nmediating knowledge, similar to that played by the Graphic Arts, but not as a \nprimary source.\nKnowledge Production:\nKnowledge production constitutes a key point in existing debates about the \nrelationship between knowledge and power. Knowledge is considered since \nmankind’s ideas have been registered throughout history, as a main source, if \nnot the most important source, of everything good and positive in individual and \nsocial life. For a person to be deemed knowledgeable or for a society to be \njudged knowledge – based are signs of superior quality. When there is such a \nsituation, the immediate question will be how knowledge can be acquired. Here \nfactors that might affect the production of knowledge attract a high level of \nattention. These factors can be characterized into two main categories: \nindividual and social.\n35 | P a g e\n1. Individual:\nIn the first category, factors which can affect the process of knowledge -\nproduction through the individuality of knowledge producers, individuals, are \ntaken into consideration. A number of different elements can influence such a \nprocess; health condition, even, can be one. But there are a group of factors \nthat define precisely that process which takes place in the human mind. They \nform one significant category termed ‘subjectivity’. Subjectivity can refer to all \nthe forces which come from the mind of the subject, the knowledge producer, \nwhen a cognitive process is operating, in order to know an object or produce \nsome knowledge about it. Since very early in the history of knowledge \nproduction it has been recognized that there are powerful forces working at the \nindividual level which encourage or force an individual to see what he likes, \ndesires, believes and so on. It has been known, also, that this limits or interrupts \nthe human capability to see what is there in reality. To deal with the problem \nthrough an effective solution, different voices for a call to honesty and sincerity \nhave emerged. This was developed into a concrete concept, that of objectivity, \nwhen modern science experienced its unparalleled advancement. Objectivity \nrefers to a condition where a researcher emancipates himself from all the \ninfluences and internal signals which inform or interfere with knowledge \nproduction, and alternatively, places his capacity at the service of a proper \ninvestigation into what is outside himself. \nHere the appreciation of objectivity in the physical sciences is different from that \nin other areas of knowledge. The physical sciences can envisage objectivity as \na main factor that has allowed the progress in science which mankind has had \nthe chance to experience in modern times. Objectivity can be regarded as a \ncentral point where the emancipation of modern science in the West from the \nlimitations placed upon scientific investigation by dominant religious beliefs, is \ncelebrated. As a result, objectivity still enjoys a very strong position in the \nphysical sciences despite all the sceptical ideas spread about the epistemology \nof knowledge. The social sciences and humanities experience a different \ncondition. Severe attacks on very central elements of these disciplines have \naffected the idea of objectivity. Since positivist endeavour to inject objectivity \ninto the social sciences with an aim to establishing a revolution similar to that \nachieved in the physical sciences hasn’t produced impressive results, a number \n36 | P a g e\nof theoretical and practical developments have emerged to bring back \nobjectivity to the science. This includes the position of a total rejection of the \npossibility of objectivity. There are some arguments to support such positions. \nOne refers to the object; there is no such thing as an ‘object’ in the social world \nwhich provides a place for objectivity. Others approach the subject arguing that \nno one can be free from beliefs, values, prejudices and so on. Everyone is \naffected by and carries some values and beliefs, and no- one can claim to be an \nexception; hence objectivity is an impossible or useless aim. Those negative \nabout a realization of objectivity in the social sciences embrace this, seemingly, \nthrough different moods; some might feel sorry about having no chance to be \nobjective. Others, like the cultural left, celebrate that as an element which allows \na beautiful diversity. \nAnother issue which has contributed profoundly to making ‘objectivity’ a \ncontentious subject in the social sciences is its relation to ‘value’. Objectivity, \ninter alia, is a state of being free from values. Here values are considered \nharmful when the mind is operating to know something. Knowledge production \nshould be directed to reveal the truth about an object. Max Weber made a \ncontribution to this discussion in which he hailed the concept of ‘truth’ itself as a \n‘value’ (Hammersley 1995, 113). This might not change many things as he \nbelieved that this value should be the main objective of knowledge production. \nThe main change comes from ideas that challenge the position of truth as the \nsupreme value of knowledge production. Different groups committed to different \nvalues blamed objectivity - driven knowledge as a knowledge that promotes \nonly that which is already established, and a continuation of existing unjust \nrelations. They are interested in seeing knowledge as a force that does \nsomething about current injustices and works for a transformation to a better \nsocial condition. It is believed that those who benefit from an unjust dominant \nposition are the main sources of bias and corruption in knowledge and this \nshould be dealt with through a form of knowledge production which does not \nremain neutral about this but has the ability to address the corrupting \ndomination through a knowledge which has been produced by a counter -\naction that comes from a suppressed perspective. Here different groups of \nfeminists and of those on the left can be seen operating. They are concerned to \npromote certain values such as gender equality, social justice and democracy. \n37 | P a g e\nTo them, a form of knowledge which stands neutral about these values does not \nexist or is not valuable; it does not exist, as if it doesn’t challenge the dominant \ncondition it helps maintain the status quo, which means providing the chance for \nthe powerful to continue their enjoyment of a dominant position. It also can be \nregarded as invaluable; for this constituency, if knowledge does not provide a \nchance for improvement and for making a better world what is the use of it? As \na result, value conflict and the commitment question produce some tendencies \nwhich are present in the current discussion; they are common in undermining \nthe role of truth as a central value or a primary aim of knowledge production. At \nthe same time there is a resistance to this, arguing that knowledge is knowledge \nwhen it is about truth. If this is not the case what is one doing when knowledge \nis being produced? The whole point of knowledge is based on producing \nsomething that allows a better understanding of the world we are attempting to \nfathom. If this does not happen, though many other helpful things might occur, it \nis not knowledge. At the same time this might not work as a call for abandoning \nother values and commitments. All values and commitments can inform the \nprocess but any attempt to take a value or commitment on board which \nweakens the already weak position of truth (based on what has been presented \nearlier in this section about the difficulties and complexities of subjectivity in the \nsocial sciences) might not help to further the production of knowledge. This is a \ncall for caution about any invitation sent to any value to participate in knowledge \nproduction, but does not mean wholesale rejection of the participation of all \nvalues. Values are not welcomed, only if they divert a related process from \nproducing knowledge; others can be accommodated freely. All that has been \nsaid here is, of course, concerned about the exact phase when actual \nknowledge production is taking place. Outside this area, there are several \nplaces, three at least, where a value commitment can play a legitimate role;\nI. Motivation for conducting one specific research project,\nII. Selecting a specific topic for investigation\nIII. Hope for an impact that might support a cause (Hammersley 1995, 116)\n38 | P a g e\n2. Social:\nA second category of what affects knowledge - production deals with factors \noutside the knowledge producer. This can include different factors such as the \nphysical, but those which are considered significant in this area are social ones. \nIn fact, a significant proportion of the factors which work on the individual level \nsuch as beliefs and values have strong social roots. Social elements are \nconsidered very effective and even determinative in producing knowledge. Such \nan idea has helped establish a discipline, sociology of knowledge, which views \nknowledge largely as a matter of social production. This has also been \nextended to cover ‘science’ through the ‘sociology of science’ but it proved to be \ncounter-productive because it poses a critical problem that challenges the very \npossibility of science, resulting in a de-legitimization of the sociology of science \nas a consequence. This has convinced some, but not all, to withdraw from such \na problematic position.\nIn the sociology of knowledge, social context plays an important role in \nknowledge production. Karl Marx might have the credit as a pioneer in this area \nof investigation; he contended that ideas, including knowledge - related ones, \nare produced under the influence of different historical contexts. Max Weber \nextended this to religious ideas, calling them constructions of particular social \ngroups. There are others, mainly on the left, who provide various justifications \nfor a demonstration that a large part of what is called knowledge is, in fact, a \nsocial construction produced under the operation of certain social forces. This \nmight leave no place for the knowledge we know as a representation of reality; \nthe knowledge that just happens to be so. It is like this because of social forces \nthat have shaped it in a certain way. If there were different social forces what \nwe recognise as knowledge would be completely different. It is easy to see that \nthis idea can be countered with a clear objection. The objectors argue that there \nis not enough attention to the content of knowledge in this analysis. They see \nthis as ignoring truth. The second criticism refers to an implicit presumption in \nthe claim that a social superstructure works permanently once it is created. \nThere is no place or explanation for changes that transform, continuously, social \nstructures. The idea is also characterized as a ‘reduction’. This refers to \nreducing a complex and multi - aspect process to a system that has only one \ninfluencing element: social context.\n39 | P a g e\nSocial context can contain different social elements; money and power are \nconsidered elements with a central role. It is believed that they are the main \nsources of influence on social affairs. There used to be a greater stress on \nmoney when critical views started to emerge. A later shift from money to power \nin those views is now taking place. As a result power relations are seen, more \nthan in the past, as a main dynamic of modern societies. From this perspective, \nsocieties are engaged with one central struggle, a struggle for power. Here \npowerful parties who benefit from current forms of a social system try to \nguarantee that it will remain unchanged, to provide the grounds for the \ncontinuation and survival of its present state. But powerless parties in the \nsociety try to change the power relations to one that offers a chance for a better \nor more just state. The existing power relations can promise an effective access \nto the resources powerful parties are used to accessing, but this state of affairs \nmight not survive without the proper social setting. This makes exercising power \na necessity. This ‘exercise’ is defined as happens when ‘A makes B do \nsomething that he does not do otherwise’(Hay 2002, 183). Exercising power, in \ngeneral, is seen through three main categories:\n1. Force: this is considered a direct and violent way of exercising power. \nHere usually armed forces, or the police are used to have B do whatever A, a \ngovernment for instance, wants. \n2. Law: power can be translated into law and regulation. In this way A can \nhave B do what he wants through making him perform lawful or legal actions. \nExercising power is less obvious here compared with the first choice, force, but \nstill many things in the area of power relations can be seen.\n3. Preference shaping: this category deals with a more complex, \ncomplicated and profound state of exercising power (Hay 2002 chapter 5). This \nis related to the idea that power cannot survive without transforming into a belief \nthat makes service to power a duty or justified. Here the subjects of power or \nthe powerless parties subscribe to an idea that serves powerful parts of the \nsociety, and provides them with a chance to maintain the current state of power \nrelations. One might ask, legitimately, here how this can happen; how one can \nallow the other to dominate him; how one can support a power relation which \ndeprives him of just access to the resources which a given society offers. It \n40 | P a g e\nseems sensible to assume that the powerless, in general, would not be ready to \ndo this if there was a chance to see reality as it is. This can make such a way of \nexercising power vulnerable to free observation of reality. Therefore, it might not \nsurvive long against waves of emancipation and disclosure unless it is attached \nto very profound beliefs in the human mind, mainly religion or knowledge. In an \nearlier age more attention was given to religious belief as a main player in this \narea but new critical thinkers tend to pay more attention to ‘knowledge’ as a \nmodern alternative. One more deduction can be derived from the above \nstatement about the possibility of this way of exercising power, similar to the \nearlier deduction that refers to a certain quality a carrier, knowledge or religion, \nshould have to be able to effectively inculcate the human mind with certain \nideas. The other deduction relates to a quality an agent should have to \naccomplish such a mission. This refers to certain individuals with a superior way \nof doing things, elites, enjoying a degree of sophistication different from the \nnormal, which puts them in a position to convince those on a lower level and to \njustify related inconsistencies and problems. Those elites who do this job might \ndo it consciously or unconsciously.\nKnowledge When Power Is Exercised:\nThe question of ‘knowledge and power’ can be viewed from two different \nperspectives; that of power and that of knowledge. The preceding paragraphs \nwere dedicated to the first one, power. This part deals with the second. Two \ncategories of effect could emerge when power operates where a process of \nknowledge production is operating: effects on power and those on knowledge. \nThe previous paragraph was designed to elaborate the effects which knowledge \ncan have on power and power relations. Power is not the only party which is \ninfluenced. It might be a main one. But there is another important party which is \naffected, and that is knowledge. There are a number of negative terms or \nconcepts to describe knowledge which is affected by power: corrupted, biased, \nmisrepresented, fabricated, distorted, invented, made up, partisan, political and \npoliticized can be mentioned in this regard. These terms can work as labels that \ndiscredit and delegitimize a piece of knowledge. However two different \napproaches to this issue have been developed in this area; one is located close \n41 | P a g e\nto the left, critical, sceptical or constructivist position or to those, in general, who \nhave moved away from positivist ideas in the social sciences. As there is no \nsuch central criterion as truth here to act as a differentiator which distinguishes \nthe biased from genuine knowledge, taking a firm position against all those \nnegative phenomena with regard to knowledge proves problematic. The \ntendency here is to see all knowledge in the social sciences as biased and \npartial or constructed. If this is so, how can one consider some biased ideas as \ncorrupted and not the others? It seems here that what works as a criterion to \ncall knowledge corrupted is attached to the origin and source of the influence; \nknowledge is biased and corrupted when it comes from powerful sources. This \nmight mean it is free from bias when it comes from the opposite side, that of the \noppressed. There is no such thing as legitimate knowledge, if one is thinking \nfrom this overall perspective; no type of knowledge is truthful or true; all are \ndifferent discourses that are provided to produce knowledge about a concept; \nthey are called ‘discourses’ when the things they deal with are smaller and \nlocal, and when they become sizeable, more universal or stable they are called \n‘paradigms’; both are tentative and socially constructed. Such knowledge is \nproduced when there is a social interest or condition that justifies its presence, \nand it disappears when it loses the capacity to satisfy the governing condition. \nHere a number of fundamental concepts of knowledge, not only truth, find a \nlimited place to play a role. All ideas about progress in knowledge production or \nany advancement in human knowledge become difficult to justify. All values, \nalso, which describe some knowledge as being better or having a better quality, \nagain, find limited license.\nA kind of loyalty to some original concepts such as truth is needed to provide a\nchance for dealing with those problems. From a positivist or post-positivist \nperspective there is room to have different knowledge with different qualities. \nAlso quantity is considered important here and can act as a source in \ndetermining quality. From this perspective knowledge affected/corrupted by \npower can be divided, I believe, into three, in general, different categories:\n1. Knowledge that is relatively independent: when the knowledge produced\nhas not been affected significantly by the dominant power, this kind of \nknowledge has a chance to emerge. This type of knowledge is found, \n42 | P a g e\nnowadays, usually in the physical or natural sciences. This state could be \nattributed to two kinds of reason; one is related to the nature of the physical \nsciences that does not provide much space for free construction. Such space, \nin comparison to the social sciences, is quite limited. The other comes again \nfrom the nature of the physical sciences, and is related to their location in \nsociety as subjects positioned far from social and political matters. This makes \nthem irrelevant or less relevant to social and political questions. As a result, \nthere is nothing, or very little, here to affect power relations in a given society. \nHence there is no need for interference by power to guarantee that knowledge \nsupports it. This is not, however, an absolute rule. There are cases of physical \nknowledge with a significant social dimension. Creation or evolution, as a topic \nin Biology, can be regarded as one significant instance. The social aspect of the \nquestion, at the same time, is different in the US when compared with many \nEuropean countries.\n2. Knowledge that is heavily affected by power: there are subjects which \nhave strong links with social issues. This refers to situations where any quality \nor change in knowledge can have serious political implications. One recent \nexample can be seen in the reaction some pro-Israeli lobbies in the US showed \ntowards a conference in Harvard University about the idea of the ‘One State \nSolution’. The severe attack against the title of such a conference was said to \nbe justified on the grounds that it conveyed a call for the destruction of Israel \n(Catz 2012). A more general instance of such phenomena in knowledge is the \nkind of history textbook which deals with national history. Almost all of them are \nbiased in a way to demonstrate a magnificent and proud past for the nation. If a \nbroader map of political issues and related knowledge is considered, other \nareas of knowledge can be identified where social forces work very hard to \nmake an impact.\n3. A different category can be perceived here that is located in an area \nbetween those two poles where the influence of power on knowledge is not so \nlight as to be ignored and is not so strong as to become a main issue.\nThe above elaboration about different types of knowledge with different levels of \nimpact by power might allow a practicable conclusion; an investigation related \nto knowledge and power can be conducted through two different approaches. \n43 | P a g e\nWhen a profound link between knowledge and the main social struggles in \nsociety is not identified or things do not have a strong political or social \ndimension, the role of power in knowledge can be discounted. It seems \nlegitimate here to assume that there is no such thing as power affecting\nknowledge. Or, alternatively, a general sensitivity to deal with such cases is \nenough. But when things are on the opposite side, there are obvious links \nbetween knowledge and social matters; if knowledge is about social or political \nmatters, it seems legitimate to take a different position. Once there is enough \nevidence that demonstrates the activity of social forces and their constructionist \nwork in the area of knowledge, this could be taken as an ‘introduction’ to \nunderstand the ‘context’ which is used as a main source to understand the \nknowledge produced. The space provided here for critical research looks\nrelatively secure, I believe, even if pro positivist arguments operate. Taking \nsuch a critical position could be justified as a move to take ‘reality’ into \nconsideration, the reality that power is operating, and that knowledge (in the \narea of the social sciences) can be influenced by such operation. In this \nsituation it looks legitimate to examine the knowledge produced from a \nperspective that allows looking at this. What is needed further here to improve \nthe legitimacy of the endeavour is what Max Weber suggested as a matter of \nclarification, clarifying a critical position that the research has chosen to take \n(Hammersley 1995, 40). This can limit the main claim of the research; this type \nof research is an investigation into the topic from one specific perspective - a \ncritical one. But this perspective is not an arbitrary choice. The choice is a result \nof considering the reality of the surrounding world/context.\nHistory Textbooks:\nWhat has been elaborated through the last sections might help to establish a \nprofound link between textbooks and social affairs. At that level what has been \npresented was, mainly, about textbooks in general, all textbooks in all subjects. \nBut, as mentioned earlier, it is difficult to assume that all subjects make the \nsame contribution to that process. It appears like a self-evident argument that \nthose subjects which are related more to social affairs, Civics for instance, play \na more important role, because they can be the main vehicle for transmitting \n44 | P a g e\nideas and values about social and political matters to textbook readers. Any \npowerful entity in general and governments in particular can use this chance to \nadvance their social and political projects. There are many examples of this; an \ninteresting one is a recommendation by the State Senate Education Committee \nin Mississippi (US) prior to desegregation saying that it is ‘recommended that \nthe civics texts provided for Negro schools contain no references to voting,\nelections, civic responsibility, or democracy’ (Jackson 1992, 445–6). When \nSocial Science and school subjects related to that discipline are at stake, one \nsubject has a special position, History.\nIn a statement which explains this importance, historian Bernard Lewis writes; \n‘We live in a time when great efforts have been made, and continue to be made, \nto falsify the record of the past and to make history a tool of propaganda, when \ngovernments, religious movements, political parties, and sectional groups of \nevery kind are busy rewriting history as they would wish it to have been, as they \nwould like their followers to believe that it was’ (1993, 130).\nStudies that have investigated History textbooks for such purposes have \nconfirmed that the knowledge provided about the subject works to improve or \nlegitimize the dominant position that the powerful occupy in society (Leahey \n2007, 38). The knowledge that can challenge this position is removed or \ndistorted. One interesting case of such treatment is suggested by Christopher \nR. Leahey who has observed that no American textbook (of those he studied) \nmentioned ‘Ernesto Che’ Guevara’ (Leahey 2007, 38). An American scholar, \nFitzgerald, who investigated 112 American history textbooks of 1833 to 1975 \ncame to the conclusion that historical developments affected how these books \nnarrated history. This is evident in the case of slavery and the labour movement \n(Leahey 2007, 33).\nThis comes from the prevalent understanding among politicians that presenting \nthe past through history contributes significantly to controlling the present and \nshaping the future (S. Foster and Crawford 2006, 6). What people receive and \nbelieve as the past is able to produce huge social energy; it can make people \ndie for a cause or kill for it (S. Foster and Crawford 2006, 6). In explaining this\nphenomenon, different ideas and theories have been suggested; one refers to \nthis as a character in line with the natural behaviour of individuals; then stories \n45 | P a g e\nof individuals about their past are not necessarily what really happened. It is \nwhat they select to have as their stories of the past (S. Foster and Crawford \n2006, 6). Here it is argued that nations behave in a similar way; the national \nhistory every nation presents is not the truth concerning its past. It is mainly \nstories the nation prefers to tell about its past and be recognized through. The \nstory can use facts and true accounts but the process, as a whole, is influenced \nheavily by political and ideological considerations which dominate a certain \nenvironment where this history is being written (Keith Crawford 2003b; S. Foster \nand Crawford 2006, 6).\nThis has a considerable capacity to explain the history of the self. Here, what \nRaymond Williams theorized as ‘selective tradition’ appears quite relevant. He \nstressed the tendency of human groups to justify and legitimize the knowledge, \nhistory and culture that belong to them, and to dismiss that of others (Hartnett \n1982, 169). Another theoretical view that can explain what is going on in history \ntextbooks is suggested by Young (1971). He emphasised the role of power and \npowerful elites in his theory; ‘those in positions of power will attempt to define \nwhat is taken as knowledge, how accessible to different groups any knowledge \nis, and what are accepted relationships between different knowledge areas and \nbetween those who have access to them and make them available’ (Hartnett \n1982, 169). This means that powerful institutions, mainly governments and \npolitical systems, tend to use their power to have a history of the past that \nserves their agenda for the present or future (S. J. Foster and Crawford 2006, \n6). This could be considered as something common that all do but, at the same \ntime, different governments and political systems show a tendency to do this \ndifferently. Some of them are in a different situation: those whose existence is \nunder threat; those who need a story as a binding tie to create a nation; those \nwho engage to invent or re-invent a national identity. All these reasons put \ngovernments in positions that view history and history textbooks through social \nor political considerations (S. Foster and Crawford 2006, 6). As a result some of \nthem use unashamedly ideological and political reasons to tell a particular \nhistory. They employ lies, misinform, distort and manipulate historical \ninformation to prove something for the self or deny that for the other (S. Foster \nand Crawford 2006, 6–7). Factors which play a role in this area create different \ncountries with different approaches to history; in the worst situations, national \n46 | P a g e\nhistories promote hatred, racism and even ethnic cleansing (S. Foster and \nCrawford 2006, 7). Stable countries or established democracies may tend to \nadopt a limited version of this position but they are not safe either. History \nbooks in 19th century US are one example. Elson (1964) who analysed more \nthan 1000 textbooks of then American schools came to the conclusion that \nthose books were working to provide legitimacy for the ‘conquest and \nsubordination of inferior races’ and ‘continuation of class distinctions’ (Hartnett \n1982, 170). If this example comes from some time ago, the 19th century, there \nis at least one contemporary one: Israel. \n‘History education is a key tool in the formation of a national identity for \nthe Jews gathered in Israel after its establishment. This population, \nespecially in the early years of the state, came from the four corners of \nthe world. No language, no culture, no belief system united these Jews. \nNot much united the one million Jews assembled in Israel, including six \nhundred thousand who came as new immigrants after the state’s \nestablishment in 1948. These Jews spoke more than seventy languages \nand dialects and came from distinct cultures. Neither did these Jews \nshare one religious orientation. Therefore, history was one potential \nuniting point and the educational authorities employed it to advance this \nunity’(Porat 2006, 197).\nConsequently the construction of a history of Israel is mainly what the Israeli \nauthorities, through educational means, use to achieve their aim. That is why \nhistory occupies a central place in the Israeli curriculum (Porat 2006, 197).\nIn this way countries and their histories could be defined through different \ncategories. The history textbook is a favourite place to see this. How \ngovernments perform in these textbooks, also forms a good indicator to the \ntolerance they allow and their capacity to consider others’ point of view (Tobin \nand Ybarra 2008, 153), which is an essential element for a scientific and \napolitical approach to history.\n47 | P a g e\nTextbook Production: The Role of Publishers, Authors and the Market\nAlongside general forces which work to shape textbooks and could be branded \nas ‘social’ or ‘political’ forces, there are other sources of influence which play a \ndirect and precise role in this process, where social and political forces translate \nto something concrete. The main ones on this level could be listed as \npublishers, authors and the market. Publishers play a central role on this level. \nThey design textbooks and take main decisions about authorship and how \ncontent should meet the existing expectations in many educational systems. \nThere is another fact which adds to the importance of the role publishers play; \nmost textbooks are published by a few publishers (Tobin and Ybarra 2008, 8). \nIn fact three mega publishers, Pearson, Education Media and Publishing Group \nLimited and McGraw-Hill, control the market of elementary and high school (el\u0002hi) publishing in the USA (Tobin and Ybarra 2008, 8). The number of publishers \nwho have a share in this market has dropped dramatically in recent years \n(Tobin and Ybarra 2008, 8). This can provide more chance for publishers to \ncontrol the market, and to be counted as responsible for textbooks and their \ncontents. Publishers, themselves, contend that the main driver for them in \ndesigning textbooks is the market and its demand (Jackson 1992, 445). They \nalso tend to consider the content of the textbook as ‘neutral knowledge’ \n(Sosniak 1960, 1421). This is, of course, a contested claim (Sosniak 1960, \n1421). There is an evident interest in the role publishers play in relevant studies \nbut this is considered as insufficient to provide necessary understanding of what \nis going on there (Jackson 1992, 444–5). The market, also, is another important \nfactor, one simple reason for this being the tens of millions of dollars (US) that \nevery year are spent for textbooks just in the US (Husen and Postlethwaite \n1994, 6369). This huge financial capacity is a powerful force which can affect \ntextbooks. The market is considered as one factor from one perspective but it \ncould be viewed through several constituting elements which include a number \nof factors such as schools, teachers, students, their parents and even pressure \ngroups or lobbies which approach publishers, in the name of business or similar \nconsiderations, to make them consider what they prefer as textbook content or \nformat.\n48 | P a g e\nAuthors are also considered responsible for what textbooks say. This appears \nvery natural as they do the actual writing. The main point in this area which is \nrelevant to this research is the meaningful difference in this responsibility which \nexists between authors of school and college textbooks. From this perspective, \nwriters of college textbooks are considered to have greater responsibility in the \nmatter of a textbook and its content while publishers tend to hold this position \ntowards school textbooks (Squire 1960, 1416). College textbooks are mainly \nauthored by one or two authors and not more (Squire 1960, 1416). These \nelements about differences between college and school textbooks stress the \nrole authors play in the college textbook, and the format of the single book as a \ndominant form of textbook in higher education.\nTextbook Analysis:\nAnalysing the textbook as a systematic investigation started soon after the \ntextbook in its new sense emerged in the 19th century. However, textbook \nanalysis is considered an endeavour which took place largely in the 20th \ncentury, since its main progress developed then. This can suggest that as a \nmain branch of curriculum praxeology, it is a new area of human knowledge \n(Goodlad 1994, 1262). As a consequence there has not yet been enough \nchance to establish a developed and sophisticated field of knowledge on this \nsubject. This has been referred to in the relevant literature, even those studies \npublished very recently (Nicholls 2003). Writers, who have discussed this, \ncontend that there is not enough material to base textbook analysis on a solid \ntheoretical foundation or to develop a methodology which can benefit from \nestablished achievements in this area. They believe more effort is needed to \nreach that stage (Bourdillon 1992, 13). This does not, though, deprive this area \nof investigation of the good position it has among researchers of different \ndisciplines including Education, History and the Social Sciences. Two main \nreasons mentioned for this are ‘the established importance of textbooks in \neducational and social matters’ and ‘their accessibility’. The first reason has \nbeen elaborated earlier. The second one is also very relevant to the making of \ntextbook analysis a popular area of research (Sadker and Sadker 1994, 5441). \nHere textbooks can be seen as a valuable source of a massive amount of data \n49 | P a g e\nwhich is ready for use and has a notable potential to represent realities and \nprocesses in society that are difficult to apprehend clearly as such (Woodward \n1994, 6367; Keith Crawford 2003a). All the revolutionary achievements that \nhave been made recently in the area of information technology in general and \ntext processing in particular add another dimension to the important role of \ntextbook analysis and the position it can occupy in the production of knowledge. \nThese might be some reasons to justify the claim made in the relevant literature \nabout this area of analysis as a field with increasing importance which promises \nto occupy a more significant position in the future (Sosniak 1960, 1421). This is \nnot a recommendation to ‘wait and see’ to realize the importance of the claim \nmade in the preceding discussion. There are a large number of monographs \nand articles that can be reached through a simple search in relevant sources of \ninformation such as Amazon or Google Scholar that can list many works that \nare devoted entirely to textbook analysis. They are about different topics; \ntextbooks published in the United States are the main subject of many \nacademic works. In addition to this, certain situations where nations have \nexperienced a dramatic change in their political system have attracted a good \nnumber of such research enterprises. Germany after World War 2, Eastern \nEuropean countries after the Cold War, countries of former Yugoslavia after \nindependence and South Africa after apartheid are the main instances. In all \nthese cases, textbooks which were developed under certain ideological or \npolitical conditions became the subject of changes that a new environment \nmade necessary.\nTextbook analysis started with simple steps; the first attempts to analyse \ntextbooks were undertaken to make textbooks free of mistakes. Finding \npossible errors or mistakes in scientific textbooks was a main business of the \nfirst research workers who were engaged in this kind of analysis. Other \nanalytical operations for textbook evaluation followed the simple step of the first \n(Alkin 1994, 1279). These included other educational concerns about textbook \nquality such as subject adequacy, language quality, text accessibility and \nmatters related to comprehension. This business is still going on and covers a \nlarge number of issues, including textbook size and design. This area of \nanalysis is popular in educational institutes and has a certain goal of making \n50 | P a g e\nbetter quality textbooks that help students to achieve established educational \nobjectives.\nAnother area of textbook analysis which became fashionable a little later is what \nassociates textbooks with international peace and security. When World War I \nhappened, a recognition of the contribution that cognitive matters could make to \nthe possibility of war or peace between different nations emerged, and \nemphasized the role of textbooks in the relevant process (Nicholls 2003; Pingel \n2010, 9). That might be a result of the idea that actual wars start from warlike \nstates of mind. Textbooks are recognized here as a notable source which \ncreates hostile minds or peaceful ones. This can come through the picture that \ntextbooks provide of the self and the other. In this way negative pictures about \nthe other are recognized as partly responsible for the hostility and wars that \ndamage international peace and security. Here textbook analysis attracted a \nnew wave of consideration. Researchers came to analyse textbooks from this \nperspective to detect contents and points with a potential for damaging peaceful \nrelations among nations through their hostile or hateful views of others. The \nmain goal here was designing textbooks that encourage peace and security. \nWorld War II was another occasion which provided the chance for more \nobservers to see this. As a result, when the United Nations was established to \npromote peace and security in the world, this subject found a place on its \nagenda; UNESCO, an affiliated body of the UN, in its first General Conference, \n1946, passed a resolution to work on this (Pingel 2010, 11). A research centre \nin Germany was established after the war, the Georg Eckert Institute for \nInternational Textbook Research, to boost such research in Europe(Lewy 1992, \n262). The Georg Eckert Institute became a centre for what is called international \nor cross-national textbook analysis(Lewy 1992, 262). UNESCO also appears as\na leading intergovernmental organization that works for this through different \ninitiatives; one main example is publishing manuals which are designed to \nencourage and guide research on textbooks. The last version of this is \n‘UNESCO Guidebook on Textbook Research’ (Pingel 2010).\nThere is another mode of textbook analysis which came later. This concerns \ndifferent kinds of bias in textbooks. In this area research on nationalism and \nsexism became popular (Stromquist 1944, 2409; Lieven 2000). A good number \n51 | P a g e\nof researchers were able to demonstrate that History textbooks are influenced \nby nationalism. Nationalism is considered as the most investigated matter in the \nfield of textbook analysis (Lieven 2000). Others did the same with sexism. \nInvestigations conducted in this area showed that men are portrayed differently \nto women in textbooks (Stromquist 1944, 2409). The earlier textbooks had more \nobvious and clearer instances of such bias. This changed later, at least in some \nindustrialized countries, including the USA (Stromquist 1944, 2409). This might \nbe considered as an attainment achieved through the awareness which \ntextbook analysis helped to provide; the chance for change became available \nwhen researchers could show through their analysis that textbooks portray a \ndifferent picture of women, making them appear less gifted (Sadker and Sadker \n1994, 5442). Ethnocentric and racial bias have been subjects introduced more \nrecently as topics to be analysed through textbook research (Lieven 2000). \nThese biases are linked to power and how powerful players deal with \nknowledge.\nMethods with Which Textbooks are Analysed:\nTextbooks are analysed in many different ways. The methods textbook analysts \nuse could be a valuable source of guidance for those who might wish to join \nsuch endeavour. This is where the first disappointment emerges; the number of \nacademic works focusing on the methodology of textbook analysis is very few \n(Jackson 1992, 436–7). While a good number of monographs and peer\u0002reviewed articles exist whose conclusions rest on textbook analysis, many of \nthem are extremely spare when they deal with methods used for that analysis; \nsome (a considerable number) do not mention any reference to such a subject. \nTheir work is mainly about investigated textbooks and the results produced \nthrough their analysis, with no indication about ways which facilitated relevant \nanalytical processes (Nicholls 2003). ‘History and Memory in the Israeli \nEducational System (Podeh 2000)’ is one example. Some others, such as ‘The \nRocky Road toward Peace (Bar-Tal 1998)’ for instance, mention methods \nemployed in a very brief way; they only name the method used, content \nanalysis in this case, or book selection made. However, there are rare works in \nthis area that provide a rich elaboration of the way textbooks are analysed in \n52 | P a g e\ntheir research. ‘Constructing national memory: The 1940/41 Blitz in British \nhistory textbooks’ by Keith Crawford (2001) is considered one clear instance \n(Nicholls 2003). Such work allows readers to understand how researchers \narrived at the results that proceed from textbook analysis. Also this provides a \ngood chance for other researchers to have a clear and effective idea about how \nthey can conduct a similar analysis. Furthermore, this adds something valuable \nto the validity of the research; such explanation provides a chance for others to \nduplicate the research and verify the results.\nAs another source of information about ways textbooks are analysed, there are \na few publications dedicated to how textbook analysis can be done; ‘UNESCO \nGuidebook on Textbook Research (2010)’ written by Falk Pingel, a well-known \nspecialist in the field, could be considered as a main one. There are useful \npoints about ways textbooks could be analysed in this volume, but the main \nreason which might deprive it of a position as a general guide to textbook \nanalysis is its notable tendency to promote and advocate ways of analysis that \nserve one main objective: international textbook analysis that encourages better \ntextbooks which can promote international peace and understanding. As a \nresult, some ways of analysing textbooks for other objectives are left out. The \nreason for this can be traced in UNESCO’s mission in this field. \nAnother monograph with a similar subject, ‘Teaching 20th Century European \nHistory’ (2001) by Robert Stradling, published by The Council of Europe, is \ncharacterized by a similar narrowness of scope. This might be considered a \nmore focused work on History textbooks in a European context. The main aim \nhere is helping to produce History textbooks that serve the culture of peaceful \ncoexistence in Europe (Nicholls 2003). No other monograph has been found in \nthe relevant literature in English which is written solely to serve textbook \nanalysis as an independent subject. There are two other main works, but not \nmonographs, written by two main scholars in the field; Jason Nicholls and Peter \nWeinbrenner. That by Nicholls ‘Methods in School Textbook Research’ is an \narticle in the ‘International Journal of Historical Learning, Teaching and \nResearch’ (Nicholls 2003), and the second by Weinbrenner, ‘Methodologies of \nTextbook Analysis Used to Date’, is a chapter in a book ‘History and Social \nSciences; Methodologies of Textbook Analysis’ based on the results of a \n53 | P a g e\nworkshop on educational research in Germany in 1990. These two works view \ntextbook analysis from a position which differs from that adopted by others; it is \na chance here to see different kinds of analysis for diverse textbook research \nobjectives. At the same time, this, itself, has been done in two dissimilar ways; \nNicholls’s article is mainly an attempt to demonstrate the state of the art in the \narea of textbook analysis. He mentions significant works in the area and \nexplains their contribution to establishing related knowledge. This ends with a \nmain conclusion that considers the available knowledge on methods of textbook \nanalysis as quite limited and insufficient. Weinbrenner probably goes further \nthan any other writer in this area, towards providing details of different aspects \nand methods of textbook analysis. As a result, his work is a rich source of \ninformation about this topic and the different goals and choices a textbook \nresearcher can make and develop. However, what he presents mostly deals \nwith textbooks in the school environment. In fact no independent work, whether \na monograph or a journal article has been accessed that chooses ‘analysis of \ncollege textbooks’ as its main topic. There are some works written based on \ntextbook analysis of college textbooks, such as “The rhetorical organization of \nthe Textbook genre across disciplines: A ‘colony-in-loops’?” (Parodi 2010) but \nthis does not include a piece of writing written solely about the methodological \naspect of the research. The above survey might give a negative impression of \nthe field if one considers that what has been produced exclusively about \ntextbook analysis is relatively unimpressive but that should not stop him looking \nfor material on this subject in other sources. In fact there is a wide range of \nliterature on social research which contains useful points or clear references to \ntextbook analysis; educational research, media studies, text analysis, \ndocumentary analysis, qualitative and quantitative analysis, and all kinds of \nsocial research, in general, could be considered the main areas in this regard.\nAll the ways suggested for textbook analysis could be catalogued in three main \ncategories according to Weinbrenner:\n- Process oriented textbook analysis\n- Product oriented textbook analysis\n- Reception oriented textbook analysis (1992, 21)\n54 | P a g e\nThese categories include all phases of the life of the textbook, respectively, \nsince the process starts when a textbook is produced and ends when it is used \nin a class and received by its readers. In this way process-oriented methods of \nanalysis refer to all processes and operations which contribute to the production \nand publication of textbooks. Here regulations and procedures that officially \ngovern the process, as well as forces which shape it through unofficial ways, \nare taken into consideration. Since the process of textbook production is \ndifferent in different countries or educational systems, this process can refer to \nrelatively different matters. But in all cases this starts with an idea about a \nparticular textbook and finishes when that has been published. All the \nprocesses and activities that are involved could be a subject of analysis \n(Weinbrenner 1992, 23). The central educational authority, schools and \npublishers are main areas of research in this phase. \nIn another kind of textbook analysis, the product-oriented one, the textbook \nitself and what it contains is the main subject of research. This third kind of \nanalysis refers to the last phase when the book is used; how teachers deal with \ntextbooks, and how students receive that teaching are the main concerns of this \nphase which is not limited, however, to these matters. The reaction of a wider \naudience in society, including parents and social leaders, and the affects \nproduced on that audience, are at stake here (Weinbrenner 1992, 23). These \ndifferent kinds of textbook analysis make different contributions to the story as a \nwhole; product-oriented analysis is considered a popular model, if not the most\npopular. Textbook analysis, also, started with this type of research \n(Weinbrenner 1992, 23). It seems that this type continues to be at the centre of \ntextbook research. What is fascinating about this type of analysis is the \nprovision of easy access to a ready supply of data that can be analysed directly, \nand also the power this kind of data has to represent social processes. \nA product i.e. the textbook might be analysed in numerous different ways. This \nis related to the different perspectives and approaches which provide a way of \nviewing this product. From one perspective there are two main categories of \nanalysis; longitudinal and latitudinal (Weinbrenner 1992, 23). The longitudinal \none refers to those analyses that cover the whole book from one end to \nanother. The other one, the latitudinal, is research about some parts of the book \n55 | P a g e\nand not all. From another perspective, textbook analysis is divided into two main \ngeneral categories; qualitative and quantitative. This division occupies a large \npart of social research. Quantitative ways of textbook analysis are mainly \nconcerned with the frequencies of using some words in a given text. Also the \nspace allocated to certain topics could be another criterion for this kind of \nanalysis. This analysis provides a good chance of examining extensive tracts of \ntext (Nicholls 2003). This is facilitated dramatically these days by computer \nassisted programs. As this type of examination cannot deal with the deep \nmeaning of the text it has some limitations in some areas of analysis such as \nthe ideological origin of the text. \nThe qualitative way, in contrast, is time-consuming but can provide the chance \nfor analysing deep levels of textual meaning. Meaning is also a point where \nfurther divisions take place; if analysis focuses on the manifest meaning of the \ntext, this forms one sub-category which is different from an alternative one that \ndeals with hidden meaning, latent analysis (Jackson 1992, 437–8; R. Franzosi \n2008, 184). There is, at least, one other major category for different analyses of \nthe product; one is concerned solely with the written text. In the other one, other \nfeatures of a textbook such as pictures, design, diagrams, tables and the like \nare also taken into consideration. \nThis is not the end of the ways textbooks are analysed. When one chooses to \nanalyse a textbook only through the text there are several possible choices. \nFrom one main perspective, the existing ways can start from the level of surface \nanalysis and move towards the deepest one. A brief review of these levels is \nable to shed some light on different choices available in this area; syntax could \nbe considered as one (R. P. Franzosi 2004, 549). The use of passive or active \nverbs can exert different influences and consequently create different meanings \n(Hardy and Bryman 2004, 549; Rogers 2004, 21). The varying ways that \nmatters are referred to in a text can be considered as a basis for another kind of \nanalysis. Some personalities, for example, receive positive references all the\ntime in a given text. This pattern of reference can reveal something about the \ntext. The language in which a concept is presented can serve a similar function. \nThe immediate context of a concept is another choice of analysis (Keith \nCrawford 2003a, 97). When it comes to information or facts presented in a \n56 | P a g e\ntextbook there are many choices of analysis with the capacity to speak about \nthe book; what is presented in the book’s content, and what is omitted from the \ntext, is one (Nicholls 2003); What has been taken as a major matter, and what \nhas been dealt with as a minor one is another choice. These treatments can \ninclude the following items as well:\n- “Factual correctness\n- Current state of subject based content and change of curriculum models\n- Controversiality\n- Methods” used (Weinbrenner 1992, 24)\nThis list can continue to cover the deepest level of analysis such as the \nepistemological position of the text.\nTextbook analysis and its general characteristics could be seen from other \nperspectives; one is related to the induction–deduction debate (Weinbrenner \n1992, 25). As in other areas of social research, some are interested in exploring \nthe general regulations which appear to govern a given social situation. Here \nthe researcher tries to find enough instances of one pattern of behaviour that \nmakes him able to suggest a general agent responsible for the pattern he \nrecognized. On the other side, there are researchers who are interested in \nexploring if one certain instance of a particular social state could be understood \nor explained through a general idea or theory that has already been suggested \nfor such phenomena. Textbook analysis can provide the chance for both types \nof research. There is another category of textbook analysis which is related or \nclose to this approach; again, here two different categories are involved; one \napproaches a textbook to analyse topics or matters already chosen for \ninvestigation. A different approach analyses the book to explore what topics or \ntendencies the book itself suggests (Nicholls 2003). \nThere are other approaches to textbook analysis that have been dealt with, in \none way or another, in the current section. One is about evaluative and non\u0002evaluative research. Evaluative research is a main tool used to assess and \ncontrol the quality of textbooks in educational environments. There is a priority \n57 | P a g e\nto find good or bad textbooks implicit in this approach and it is employed with an \naim to improve the quality of textbooks used and to provide a chance to deal \nwith failures in developing proper textbooks (Alkin 1994, 1279; Nicholls 2003). \nFrom another perspective textbooks are divided into two categories of \ncomparative and non-comparative research. In the comparative category a \ntextbook or a group of textbooks could be compared with other/s which usually \nbelong to a different time, place or system. \nTextbook analysis, in general, is seen in two different ways from another \nviewpoint. Some analyses have a clear aim to change the book. They take a \ncritical position and try to demonstrate how the current state of the book is far \nfrom what it should be. In this way they try to convince the readers that there \nare significant deficiencies in the textbooks under investigation which allow and \nlegitimize a real change that converts the book in hand to one that can work \nbetter. In contrast, there are some analyses that advocate the status quo. This \ncan be explicit or implicit. Here what can be seen in available textbooks and all \nquestions about their quality or function is portrayed as desirable or natural, \nwhich legitimizes their presence in the book or precludes questioning it. \nWhen a textbook is chosen as a main matter of analysis there is one \nfundamental question about it which affects the nature of research and its \nconclusion; it is that of representation. What exactly does a textbook represent \nin a given analysis? There are two things, at least, a textbook can represent; it \ncan be viewed as a discrete unit whose purpose is to pass on knowledge, to \ntransmit facts, and its success in doing so can be evaluated. In addition, a \ntextbook has a considerable capacity to represent areas broader than itself due \nto its significant role in forming, or being formed by other realities or processes. \nEducation, knowledge and social processes could be considered some areas of \ninvestigation that a textbook could be used as a representative to speak for. In \nthis way there is a chance, for instance, to use a textbook as a subject of \nanalysis in order to develop some conclusions about a given educational \nsystem.\nEverything presented here about ways textbooks are analysed does not refer to \nactual methods used for such an enterprise. In fact there are some main \nmethods which are used for textbook analysis. Content analysis, discourse \n58 | P a g e\nanalysis, semiotic analysis and narrative analysis could be mentioned here. \nTextbook analysts either use one of these methods or a mixture of them to \nconduct a given piece of research. The method used in this research is \nelaborated later in this thesis; in Chapter Four.\nAs a conclusion about textbook analysis and methods used for certain textbook \nresearch projects, what Pingel stated in the UNESCO guidebook could be \nmentioned here; When he was refraining from giving examples of completed \nanalytical instruments he stressed that the ‘categories and methods for analysis \ncan only be presented in a very general way due to the very specific nature of \nevery project’ (Nicholls 2003).\n59 | P a g e\nChapter 2: Review of the Related Literature\nIntroduction:\nThe relevant literature is reviewed in this chapter to document and critique \nstudies that are conducted to investigate the textbook treatments of the \nIsrael/Palestine question. The results of such studies are located in different \nmedia such as books, articles, reports, theses and websites. All of them are \ntaken into consideration if the textbooks selected for analysis are used in the \narea of courses in ‘Western Civilization’1. This is to give a picture of what \nalready has been done by other researchers in the area, how they approached \nsuch analyses and what results they offered. The studies explored can be \nclassified into two different categories; studies that investigated the question \nthrough a more general topic such as the Middle East, the Arabs, Muslims or \nthe Third World. The Israel/Palestine question, in this category, forms one \ncomponent of these analyses, or the question is dealt with without mentioning \nPalestine or Israel through discussing more general topics that can include it; \nthe ‘Arabs’ is a good instance as this topic deals with issues directly relevant to \nthe question of Israel/Palestine without specifically referring to it. There are \nother works, classified in another category, which are focused solely on the \nIsrael/Palestine question. All these studies, from the two above - mentioned \ncategories, are presented in chronological order, in the first part of this chapter. \nIn the second part, those studies are categorized based on their results about \nthe explored bias; most of them confirm that a pro-Israel bias dominates the \nanalysed textbooks. There are a few that argue for an anti-Israel bias. Both \nsides’ arguments are presented in this section. This chapter will end with a \nconclusion that crystallizes the results of this review, explaining why this review \njustifies choosing this research topic in order to further knowledge of the area \ndiscussed.\n \n1\nThis area includes European countries, USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.\n60 | P a g e\nStudies That Deal with the Question in General or in Particular:\nThe first study explored here that deals with the topic was conducted in the \n1950’s. ‘Misconceptions in the Treatment of the Arab World in Selected \nAmerican Textbooks for Children’ (Alami 1957) is an unpublished MA thesis \nthat was produced in Kent State University, which, suggested that a bias \nexisted in American textbooks that promoted a misconception about the Arab \nworld. The first work published on the subject, ‘Treatment of the Middle East in \nAmerican High School Textbooks’ was found in the Journal of Palestine studies \n(JPS) published in the US in 1975. The author, Glenn Perry an Associate \nProfessor of Political Science at Indiana State University, who analysed 20 \nAmerican junior and senior high school textbooks on history and area studies, \nconcentrated ‘on the extent of coverage and treatment of Islam, the \ncontemporary Arabs, and the Arab-Israeli conflict’ and suggested some \nimportant conclusions about the textbook treatment of the question that affected \nmany works that appeared later. Nothing about methodology, in the texts \nthemselves, methods used for the analysis of the texts or theories which this\npresent study can be based on is presented in this article. It is not clarified, as \nwell, how the selected textbooks are designated. The article deals directly, and \nwithout any introduction, with textbook statements that might show a pro-Israel \nbias (Perry 1975). A book published at the same time (1975) by The Medina \nUniversity Press International is titled ‘Arabs in America: Myths and Realities’ \n(Abu-Laban); one chapter of the book (pp 113-132), ‘Images of the Arabs in \nAmerican Social Science Textbooks’ deals with how American textbooks treat \nArabs in US school books (Al-Qazzaz 1975).\nAnother important piece of research that was conducted in 1975 was published \nby the Middle East Studies Association of North America. What happened in the \nUS after the 1973 war between the Arabs and Israel, and the subsequent oil \nembargo might have contributed to the research boom about the topic. In an \ninfluential work, ‘The Image of the Middle East in Secondary School Textbooks,’ \nWilliam J. Griswold analysed 42 Canadian and American secondary school \nbooks for the way they treat the Middle East. This research, in comparison to \nother relevant works produced prior to it, had a clearer methodological \norganization. First of all the analysis is limited to one specific area, the\n61 | P a g e\nsecondary level. Further, it puts limitations on textbook selection: only World \nHistory, Social Studies, and Geography textbooks are targeted. More \nimportantly it designs the exact area of examination: Middle East geography \nand culture, economics, and mal-distribution of wealth, cultural bias and ethnic \nstereotypes, religious bias and stereotypes, United States relations in the \nMiddle East, and the Arab-Israeli wars. It also makes another methodological \nclarification when formulating the exact criteria of investigation: errors in \ncontent, oversimplification of complicated issues, and stereotyping (Griswold \n1975). These accuracies might have contributed to its position as a main source \nof the knowledge about relevant literature. A PhD thesis conducted on the \nsubject, ‘Images of the Arabs in United States Secondary School Social Studies \nTextbooks: A Content Analysis and a Unit Development’ also chose to analyse \nthe most widely used secondary US history textbooks through quantitative and \nqualitative methods (Jarrar 1976). This study that is described as ‘the most \nsystematic study in terms of procedure and analysis’ (Jacobs 1981) came to a \nconclusion that the problem with images of Arabs in American textbooks is \n‘caused by a number of factors which include omissions, stereotypes, over \ngeneralities and a lack of balance in the presentation of material’(Jacobs 1981).\nA number of research exercises were conducted later on the subject that \nconcentrate on teachers; ‘Teaching Materials and Sources of Information on the \nMiddle East for Secondary School Teachers’ is one such work that was \npublished in the Journal of Social Education. Malcolm Peck, the author, \nconcluded that textbooks are ‘over - simplified and filled with inaccurate, biased, \nand stereotyped information; authors often overlooked important causes of \nevents or disguised moral judgments as factual history’ (Peck 1976). A book \npublished by the Middle East Studies Association of North America, ‘American \nImages of Middle East Peoples: Impact of the High School’ also concentrated \non images teachers hold about the Middle East (Suleiman 1977). A PhD thesis, \n‘Images of the Arabs and of Their Conflict with Israel Held by American Public \nSecondary School Social Studies Teachers’, conducted in Stanford University, \nfocused on the same subject (Abu-Helu 1978). In a book published by Women \nConcerned about the Middle East, ‘The Arab World: A Handbook for Teachers’, \nteachers are at the centre again (Al-Qazzaz 1978). This book supports the \ntheory that there is a pro-Israel bias in American textbooks: ‘In American \ntextbooks the indigenous people of Palestine are usually referred to as “Arabs,\" \n62 | P a g e\n\"refugees\" \"natives,\" or \"Moslems,\" As in the media prior to the 1970's, \ntextbooks avoid the word Palestinian’ (Al-Qazzaz 1978, 37). Textbook analysis \nof history textbooks is recognized by the United Nations as contributing to a \nbetter relationship between Islam and the West; a conference held, in 1979, in \nthe UN office in Geneva, ‘Islam and the West’ published a report, ‘The Revision \nof History Textbooks and the Improvement of Teaching Materials a Way of \nContributing to a Better Understanding Between Islam and the West’ on this \nsubject. Later in 1981, a piece of PhD research was conducted in Stanford \nUniversity on the subject: ‘Coverage of the Arab World in American Secondary \nSchool World Studies Textbooks: A Content Analysis’ (Nabti 1981). No copy of \nthis research was found, as it has not been published.\nIn an article, ‘Teaching the Arab World: Evaluating Textbooks’, published in \n‘The Social Studies’, the author, Deborah Jacobs, conducted research \nsponsored by the National Association of Arab Americans (NAAA) to study \ntextbooks used in metropolitan Washington, D.C. school systems. This study \nconcentrated on presentation of the Arab World and Islam in junior and senior \nhigh school textbooks used then (1980) in Fairfax County, Virginia, Montgomery \nCounty, Maryland, and the District of Columbia. Nineteen textbooks are \nevaluated against nine subjects; education, economy, political factors, religion, \nArab characteristics, ancient history, women, the Arab-Israeli conflict, and \ngeography. A measure was used to rate the analysed textbooks in the area, for \nbias, accuracy, stereotyping, and balance. Textbooks are ranked in four \ndifferent categories: 1 =highly recommended, 2=recommended with revisions, \n3=not recommended and 4=unacceptable. ‘The NAAA study concluded that of \nthe nineteen books reviewed by the committee, only fifteen percent of the total \ncould be highly recommended; two of those three are not textbooks as such but \nwere intended as supplemental resource works to be used with Social Studies \nand History texts. Thirty percent of the books surveyed were recommended, \nprovided they can be revised or supplemented with other materials in particular \nareas. Fully fifty percent of the texts reviewed by the committee were of such \npoor quality that they could not be in good conscience recommended for \nteaching Middle East history and civilization in secondary schools’ (Jacobs \n1981). Again here some methodological points are missing: how textbooks are \nselected and the rationale for choosing the nine criteria of investigation can be \n63 | P a g e\nmentioned, for instance. The results of this research can serve an educational \npurpose by rating the textbooks, but such results are largely based on the \nresearcher’s judgment. The related arguments for such a judgment are not \nshared with the reader. This might not represent the best treatment of the \nresearch topic when the latter is controversial and value – related, except for \nexclusive educational purposes. Also in such analyses accuracy is sacrificed for \nthe sake of simplification. Another article in 1983, ‘Teaching about the Middle \nEast in Elementary School’ (Marek, Rosanne J.) states that ‘elementary texts (in\nthe USA) dehumanize Middle Eastern peoples by reducing them to mere \ncaricatures’ (Marek 1983).\nA PhD thesis, ‘State Adoption Policies, Publishing Practices, and Authorship: \nThe Production of Middle East Chapters in World History Textbooks’ (van de \nVen 1990) has been conducted to cover a new dimension of textbook \ntreatments of the Middle East. The author claimed that all other research \nconducted in this area failed to see the topic from this perspective (van de Ven \n1990, vi). The research, identifying the textbook approaches to the Middle East, \ntraces the evolution of the Middle East section of textbooks to evaluate the \ninfluence of different factors in textbook production. The author argues, as she \nputs it, against the popular view that state adoption institutes dictate policy on \npublishers’ agendas (van de Ven 1990, v). She concludes that this is one \ninfluential factor, besides others, including publishers’ practices and the \nauthorship element (van de Ven 1990, v). She considers the way in which the \nMiddle East is treated as representative of the way in which non-Western \nregions are treated in American secondary level textbooks (van de Ven 1990, \n1). This piece of research, unlike many others conducted earlier, is process -\noriented and not product - oriented. The methodology part of the thesis is very \nbrief, making it difficult for others to repeat or to test the results.\nIn 1993, a research report, Rewriting History in Textbooks, was published that \nmight not be considered as an academic work since it has not been published \nor produced under any academic supervision or expertise; it has no \nbibliography and has no references even when direct quotation is at stake. But \nit has been chosen for mention here as it takes a noticeable position on the \ntextbook treatment of the Israel/Palestine question: ‘(Jewish) silence has \n64 | P a g e\nallowed publishers to distribute books that are filled with egregious factual \nerrors and specious analyses. The mistakes invariably are to the detriment of \nthe Jews or Israel, raising questions about the predisposition of authors and \npublishers’ (Bard 1993). The writer, Mitchell Bard, the Executive Director of the \nAmerican-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise (AICE), and the director of the Jewish \nVirtual Library, examined eighteen American history textbooks, eleven World \nHistory and seven American History, concluding that only two of them are \nrecommendable. A list of these eighteen textbooks is included under \n‘Bibliography’. These books are introduced as ‘the most widely used world and \nAmerican history texts’ but nothing is presented to justify this position or how \nthey are selected (Bard 1993). Any discussion of the methods, methodology or \ntheoretical basis that makes such research possible is absent.\nIn 1994, in another piece of research, published by the Center for Middle \nEastern and North African Studies, Elizabeth Barlow investigated seventy five \nAmerican textbooks for how they treat the Middle East: ‘Evaluation of \nSecondary-level Textbooks for Coverage of the Middle East and North Africa’. \nShe ranked the studied textbooks in different categories from A to E where A \nrepresents the highest quality. Barlow came to the conclusion that problems \nand biases which Griswold identified in 1975 still exist (Morgan 2002, 42). She \npublished an article a year later, 1995, stressing the results of her investigation: \n‘The Middle East Studies Association (MESA) and the Middle East Outreach \nCouncil (MEOC) have long been concerned with the inadequate and inaccurate \nportrayal of Middle Eastern history, geography and culture in many pre \ncollegiate texts. In its initial 1974 examination of K-12 textbooks, MESA found \nthem generally disappointing. Although in the last nineteen years, several \nsuperior texts have been published, regrettable errors still exist in many other \nbooks’ (Barlow 1995). She blamed the textbook writers for the disappointing \nerrors she discovered: ‘Apparently, when writing about topics that concern the \nMiddle East, American writers do not feel any need to consult world area \nexperts. As a result, several texts offer serious misinformation and frequently \nonly America-centered perspectives’ (Barlow 1995). Barlow’s research became \ninfluential and a main source of reference for the relevant literature in the years \nto come.\n65 | P a g e\nThe first academic work that concentrates specifically on the Arab-Israeli \nquestion appeared in 1996. Marlene Rock through her Master’s thesis \nsubmitted in Queens College (City University of New York), ‘The Arab-Israeli \nConflict as Depicted in Children's and Young Adult Non-Fiction Literature’, tried \nto fill the gap. She argued that although there are enough sources for adults to \nget knowledge about the conflict there is not such a situation for school children. \nTo deal with the problem she identified 103 works about the history of the \nconflict that can, the author claims, help students to access knowledge of the \nquestion (Rock 1996, abstract). The main function of this research is an \nannotated bibliography of the sources identified, and it does not involve an \nindividual critique of these sources.\nIn the same year, 1996, another work appeared with a promising title: ‘A Critical \nAssessment of Textbooks for Middle Eastern History’. The abstract of this \narticle also increases the hope of finding an analysis that has relevant content \non college level textbooks: (this article) ‘Discusses the strengths and \nweaknesses of Middle Eastern history textbooks appropriate for college \ninstruction, reviews the textbooks in terms of coverage, how current is the \ninformation, and style and content, provides a wealth of background information\n. ..’ (Allen 1996). In practice this article is composed of four pages that describe \na few textbooks on the history of the Middle East, mainly ‘A Concise History of \nthe Middle East’, and ‘A History of the Modern Middle East’, and raises some \npoints about using them in colleges as a textbook in related courses. This short \narticle can benefit college teachers who are wondering which existing books \nmight work better.\nIncreasing interest in finding unbiased textbooks for teaching the Middle East \nhelped in the development of another academic research exercise in the USA: \n‘The Development of A Content Analysis Instrument for Analysing College-level \nTextbooks Used in The United States to Teach About The Middle East’. The \nresearcher, Adel Tawfig Al-Bataineh, who reviewed the literature on the \ntextbook treatment of the Middle East made three important points; first, most of \nthe works produced support the conclusion that bias is widespread when it is a \nmatter of textbook treatment of the Middle East, second, there is no content \nanalysis that analyses college level textbooks, and third, there is no instrument \n66 | P a g e\nto use when textbooks are analysed for such a purpose. In his research, he \nworked to construct such an instrument that can help educators when they are \nconducting a content analysis of textbooks for their treatment of the Middle \nEast. He used standards and goals suggested by UNESCO and Councils for \nSocial Studies, Geography, and World History for what students should know \nabout a subject, for such a construction (Al-Bataineh 1998, 79). In his \nmethodology Al-Bataineh used communication, through normal mail, to reach \nuniversity teachers who are engaged in teaching the Middle East (Al-Bataineh \n1998, 53).\nA piece of research titled ‘U. S. Global Studies Textbooks’ Treatment of Foreign \nCountries’ that came later opened a new dimension in the textbook treatment of \nforeign questions; a comparative dimension. Alexander Tumanpea, a PhD \nstudent in the State University of New York at Buffalo, conducted this research \nto study textbook treatments of foreign countries and made some useful points:\n ‘The issue of how social studies textbooks portray world regions has \nnot been a major research concern’ (Tumanpea 1998, 22),\n ‘Like the literature on world regions, the individual country literature is \nmarked by isolated cases of U. S. texts’ treatment of foreign \ncountries (Tumanpea 1998, 23)’\n ‘Yet, this critical concern about the elitist nature of Social Studies \ntextbooks’ content, has not been extended to the investigation of \nthose parts of the texts which deal with foreign societies. Rather, \nthere are a number of fragmented studies which generally deal with \nindividual foreign countries and foreign world regions’ (Tumanpea \n1998, 9)\n ‘No research effort on Global Studies textbooks’ content has \nconsidered a comparative study of two or more cases of the world’s \ncultural areas’ (Tumanpea 1998, 2)\nThe last finding is considered a ‘serious neglect’ that should be dealt with \nthrough Tumanpea’s thesis (Tumanpea 1998, 2). As a result this study engaged \nto make a comparative study to investigate how US secondary school global \nstudies texts treat ‘Western Europe, the Middle East, and Sub-Sahara Africa, \ncountries of European descent and countries of African descent, and developed \n67 | P a g e\nversus developing countries’ (Tumanpea 1998, abstract). A central question has \nbeen designed to guide the research: \n1. ‘How do the global studies textbooks of one of the world’s most \ndeveloped and powerful countries (U. S. A.), present: \nA. Foreign regions which have fundamental socioeconomic differences?\nB. Countries of European background and countries of African \nbackground? \nC. Developed as opposed to developing countries? \n2. To what extent do global studies textbooks serve the said purpose of \npresenting the world as a single human community in which people of \nvarious national, ethnic, and cultural backgrounds can see themselves in \nrelation to all others, with sensitivity, appreciation and a sense of \ninterdependence, and without national biases?’(Tumanpea 1998, 2)\nThis research is quite rich in theory and has solid theoretical foundations; it is \nbased on the World System Analysis in Comparative Education which views \neducational products through the effects of changing world systems on national \neducational systems. It is also based on ‘Conflict Theory’ of education that \nconsiders the educational content as the product of powerful elites of a given \nsociety that work to promote their interests in that society (Tumanpea 1998, 7–\n8).\nIn 1999 an essay published in ‘History Teacher: A Journal of Methods’ suggests \na different approach to analysing textbook treatment of the Middle East. In this \narticle, ‘Ethnocentric and Stereotypical Concepts in the Study of Islamic and \nWorld History’, five concepts used widely in Middle East Studies textbooks are \nquestioned and criticized: the Middle East, the bipolar concepts of East and \nWest, the Judaic-Christian (Judeo-Christian) heritage, Islamic fundamentalism, \nand Jihad. This powerful investigation concluded, in the author’s words, that: ‘All \nfive concepts suffer from various degrees of inaccuracy, vagueness, ambiguity, \nand oversimplification. I argue that four of the five concepts suffer from \nethnocentrism, in particular North American or Eurocentrism’ (Rahme 1999). \n68 | P a g e\nThe article deals with an important dimension of textbook treatment of the \nMiddle East that crystallized into concepts constructed to talk about the Middle \nEast, and the ideological or political meaning and messages they carry and \ndisseminate.\nAn analysis of college level textbooks was explored that examined US History \nsurveys which are used for teaching undergraduate students. The main \nquestion in this investigation, a PhD thesis in the University of Houston, is; ‘Are \npublic higher education, undergraduate level, American History survey \ntextbooks biased? Are they censored? Will one discover, upon examination, \nAmerica’s continuing religious heritage, including contemporary Protestantism, \nor will one discover that the rich American religious heritage and contemporary \nProtestantism have largely disappeared? (Goodwin 1999, 5–6)’ This question \ndoes not introduce this thesis, titled ‘Evidence of Bias and Censorship in \nCollege History Survey Textbooks’, as a directly relevant piece of literature. But \nthere are characteristics, other than that of the main topic, which might justify its \npresence in this review: It is the only academic analysis that I have found of\ncollege level history textbooks. Furthermore, it introduces a different concept, \ncensorship, for textbook treatments of social issues. The researcher, however, \nborrowed this concept from another piece of research that is introduced as a \nbase and framework for his own research: ‘Censorship: Evidence of Bias in Our \nChildren’s Textbooks’ (Vitz 1986). The methodology used is quantitative, and \ninvolves a line – by - line, and page - by - page investigation of the selected \ntextbooks to find the instances of a reference to religion in the words or images \nof the text in question. All references are scored and counted to provide a \nchance for making a judgment about how history survey textbooks have treated \nreligion throughout the passage of time. This kind of investigation can bring \neffective results for educational purposes but it introduces a problem if the topic \nof investigation is controversial. For such a topic the contribution made by \npersonal judgment should be minimized. In such cases, the main weight of the \ninvestigation, I argue, should be put on the ‘evidence’ and ‘related arguments’ \nper se.\nAnother work that is related, indirectly, to this literature is a book, ‘Blaming the \nVictims: Spurious Scholarship and the Palestinian Question’, edited by Edward \n69 | P a g e\nSaid and Christopher Hitchens. This work does not involve a textbook analysis \nbut it deals with the related scholarship that is influenced by whoever tries to \njustify Zionist claims about the Israel/Palestine Question. In Said’s words; ‘Since \nthe 1948 war which drove them from their homeland, the Palestinian people \nhave consistently been denied the most basic democratic rights. Blaming the \nVictims shows how the historical fate of the Palestinians has been justified by \nspurious academic attempts to dismiss their claim to a home within the\nboundaries of historical Palestine and even to deny their very existence’ (Said \nand Hitchens 2001, back cover).\nA PhD thesis on the subject, ‘The Portrayal of The Middle East in School \nTextbooks from 1880 to The Present’ took a different methodological \nperspective to assess how this treatment has evolved over a century in \nAmerican schools (Morgan 2002). The researcher, Hani Morgan, has chosen \nfour time periods; ‘1875-1920 (post civil war to end of WWI), 1920-1940 (the \nperiod during which American schools expanded and in which America’s place \nin the larger world became a concern), and 1945-1965 (inter and post war \nyears) and from 1970 to the present’ (Morgan 2002, iii – iv). He analysed \ntextbooks for the first three time periods, and took the results of research done \nby Barlow and Griswold as those representing the fourth time period so as to be \nable to compare the different periods of textbook treatment of the Middle East \nand identify a trend. He concludes that ‘the later the time period, the better the \nchance there will be a more accurate and favorable portrayal of the Middle East. \nAlthough this is a general finding, many of the later books contain very negative \nstereotypes as well as inaccurate descriptions of Islam, bias towards the Arab \npolitical system, and pictures that don’t reflect the everyday life of the majority of \npeople in the Middle East’ (Morgan 2002, 164). Textual analysis was the \nmethod used in this study but no further attempt has been made to specify the \nnature of this analysis. At the same time there is a useful reference to \ngeography, pictures, culture, religion and politics, as the main areas of focus in \nthis analysis. The theoretical basis of this research is mainly Edward Said’s \nOrientalism, but it is, also, informed by the ideas of Michel Foucault in the area \nof power and knowledge where he describes academic thought as a political \ncraft that creates power. Later, in 2008, the results of this research were\npublished in the ‘American Educational History Journal’ (Morgan 2008).\n70 | P a g e\nAfter the 9/11 events in the US and the policy which the American \nadministration adopted to deal with these events, another wave of literature \narrived that criticized American treatment of the Middle East through different \nmedia, including educational instruction. One good sample is a book edited by \nJoe L Kincheloe and Shirley R Steinberg; ‘The Miseducation of the West: How \nSchools and the Media Distort Our Understanding of the Islamic World’ (2004). \nAnother instance is represented through ‘The Arab and Muslim Image in Public \nEducation Textbooks of the United States of America’ a text written by Ahmed \nAl-Banyan. ‘Studying the Exotic Other in the Classroom: The Portrayal of Arab \nAmericans in Educational Source Materials’ (David and Ayouby 2005), an \narticle in Multicultural Perspectives, can be mentioned in this framework as well.\nAnother thesis-length study, ‘A Novel Reading: Literature and Pedagogy in \nModern Middle East History Courses in Canada and the United States’, \nappeared at the same time, 2005, and approached Middle East history from a \ndifferent angle (Leeke 2005). It focused on course syllabi as the main source for \nanalysing how Middle East history textbooks are treated at college level; ‘The \npurpose of this study is to explore how the Arabic novel can and does challenge \nthe conventional characterization of what constitutes constructive Middle East \nhistoriography. The thesis draws on a case study of undergraduate history \ncourse syllabi in order to highlight a number of crucial issues related to Arabic \nliterature and the production of modern Middle East history’ (Leeke 2005, \nAbstract). For such a purpose, ninety-three syllabi were collected from \nintroductory or survey undergraduate courses or seminars on the history of the \nmodern Middle East. Sixty-five of them were found fit for the analysis. To collect \nthem two methods were used: searching relevant keywords in search engines \nsuch as Google, and correspondence with lecturers on the Modern Middle East \ncourses through their email addresses (Leeke 2005, 7–8). The collected syllabi \nare analysed through a text analysis. This analysis is based, theoretically, on \nDavid Nunan’s study, ‘Syllabus Design: Language Teaching: A Scheme for \nTeacher Education’ which states that a syllabus is useful for analysis as it \nrepresents a ‘statement of content’ of a course, and some other materials \nrelevant to syllabus studies (Leeke 2005, 15). One main theoretical assumption \nthat has been borrowed for this research is related to the role college \nteachers/lecturers play in designing a syllabus that includes a section on what \n71 | P a g e\nstudents should read (reading list), and the significance of this role in \ndetermining the content of the course. It is also stressed, rightly, that this role \nand its effective consequences on what students learn have remained\nundiscussed: ‘Professors make important decisions about how the course \nsubject matter will be taught based on a variety of factors. Unfortunately, as \nGregory S. Jay argues, particularly with regard to assigning \"cultural objects\" \nsuch as novels, many syllabi in the humanities remain \"suspiciously silent about \ntheir social and institutional construction: about the choices the syllabus has \nmade, the alternatives it has considered and abandoned, and the external \npressures that have shaped it\". Those decisions, however, are often reflected in \nthe language and structure of the course syllabus. Thus, by examining the \nselection and description of the \"assigned objects\" and \"their place on the \nsyllabus\", it is possible to uncover some of the \"process of disciplinary \nconstruction that has put them there\" (Leeke 2005, 17)’. The research allows \nthe researcher to find the most adopted textbooks on the history of the Middle \nEast, and how novels are treated in the course reading lists. William L. \nCleveland's ‘A History of the Modern Middle East’ is introduced as such an \nexample since it was adopted in forty-two syllabi (out of sixty-five) as a source \nof course knowledge (Leeke 2005, 33). However in general the main conclusion \nof the research, in the researcher’s own words is as follows: \n‘My analysis of the syllabi concludes that in general, Arabic novels in \ntranslation are part of a varied group of resources selected by a \nprofessor in order to complement the 'official' histories provided by \ntextbooks and government documents. The novel is deemed helpful \nbecause it often describes the 'ordinary' or daily life of people. Also, the \nnovel is presented as the contribution of an 'indigenous voice' to the \nhistorical narrative’ (Leeke 2005, Abstract). \nMany points presented in this research can justify what I have done in Chapter \n3 to select the most adopted textbooks on the Israel/Palestine question.\nA remarkable work was published in 2006 on analysis of history textbooks; \nWhat Shall We Tell the Children? International Perspectives on School History \nTextbooks’, edited by two prominent scholars in the field; Keith A. Crawford and \nStuart J Foster. Many textbooks from different countries including China, Japan, \n72 | P a g e\nNorth and South Korea, Germany, Pakistan, South Africa, USA, Italy, Sweden \nand the UK have been investigated in different chapters of this book. There are, \nalso, two chapters that deal with analysis of Israeli and Palestinian textbooks \nbut no work in this book deals with how the question is treated by Western \ntextbooks (S. Foster 2006a).\nYears after American bloody involvements in two Middle Eastern countries, \nAfghanistan and Iraq, a textbook analysis has been developed in 2007 to \nexplore a possible cause of American misperceptions about the Middle East. \nThis research, ‘The Portrayal of The Middle East in Secondary School U.S. \nTextbooks’, took a statement by Reinhart that American students walk into \ncollege classes on the Middle East/Islam with negative and stereotypical views \nacquired beforehand (Brockway 2007, 19). For the researcher, Elizabeth Marie \nBrockway, this is not the most significant problem. She approaches the problem \nthrough the influence of a national image of a foreign country/region on \nAmerican involvement in that area. In this respect she relies on Holsti’s \ntheoretical point on how a belief system affects national decisions: ‘The \nrelationship of national images to international conflict is clear: decision-makers \nact upon their definition of the situation and their images of states — others as \nwell as their own. These images are in turn dependent upon the decision\u0002makers’ belief system. And these may or may not be accurate representations \nof “reality’ (Holsti 1962). American Middle Eastern policy is seen as problematic \nin this research, and the solution is seen in what Holsti recommends for such a \nsituation: \n‘Holsti (1962) concluded that in order to resolve international conflict, \nerroneous images of other countries had to be corrected — leaders’ \nbelief systems had to provide a more accurate impression of other \npeople and cultures. In a democracy, leaders must be responsive to the \nviews of their constituents and thus, leaders’ belief systems are linked to \nthose of the public. For example: if the people of the United States \nbelieve that inhabitants of the Middle East are terrorists, the people will \nsupport policies within the U.S. that reflect that, and they will be unlikely \nto support aid and policies friendly towards the Middle East. Even \nenlightened leaders will have to respond to these demands or face \n73 | P a g e\nelectoral defeat. Thus the belief systems of ordinary people are crucial to \nunderstand’ (Brockway 2007, 4). \nBased on this theoretical foundation the researcher designs a hypothesis for a \ntextbook analysis: ‘high school textbooks used in the United States provide an \ninadequate and negatively biased portrayal of the Middle East’ (Brockway 2007, \n29). For this investigation, ten world history textbooks from secondary schools \nare selected for analysis. To represent a wider community, Brockway chooses \nher selections from the list of ‘Widely Adopted Textbooks’ that are regularly \npublished by the American Textbook Council (ATC). Quantitative and qualitative \nmethods are used to analyse those textbooks for three kinds of bias: word use, \nomission of data, and presentation of inadequate information. Six subjects, \nincluding the Arab-Israeli conflict are chosen as the areas of analysis (Brockway \n2007, 29–32).\nAnother research exercise is published by the Middle East Studies Association \nof North America (MESA), ‘The Portrayal of the Middle East in Four Current \nSchool Textbooks’ to assess the American textbook treatment of the Middle \nEast. Four American textbooks are analysed for their political, cultural, religious \nand pictographic portrayal of the Middle East through using content analysis as \na method. The way those books are selected and their number, four, does not \nprovide a real chance to claim a wide representation but this is recognized in \nthe title of the article. One significant aspect of this research that renders it \npowerful among other research in this area is the involvement of six \nresearchers who work to check the consistency of the judgments for bias \n(Morgan and Walker 2008).\nA book, The Trouble with Textbooks: Distorting History and Religion, written by \nformer President of the Institute for Jewish and Community Research in San \nFrancisco, Gary Tobin and Dennis R. Ybarra, published in 2008, marked a \ncrucial development in the history of the relevant literature; it appeared at odds \nwith many, if not all, other related research in claiming that the bias American \ntextbooks are suffering from is anti-Israeli, pro-Arab and pro-Islam (Tobin and \nYbarra 2008). The book is celebrated differently in the American mass media: \nFOX News channel aired, on 4 September 2009, a one hour program, titled ‘Do \nYou Know What Textbooks Your Children Are Really Reading? to raise the \n74 | P a g e\npoints made in this book (“The Trouble With Textbooks | Fox News” 2013). A \nwebsite (http://troublewithtextbooks.org), in addition, is dedicated to advertising \nthis book and its results. An executive summary of the book is provided there to \ndownload for free. Other websites, including Family Security Matters, provided a \nchannel for it to echo the results of this research (“Family Security Matters | \nExclusive: Review: ‘The Trouble with Textbooks” 2013). The research is full of \nrelevant points that might help the readers become familiar with the concerns of \npro-Israeli lobbies about textbook content on the Israel/Palestine question. \nFurthermore, a powerful rhetoric is skilfully used to formulate the results in \neffective wording but there are some shortcomings in the methodology used, \nwhich are as follows:\n- While the main claim of the research rests on ‘textbooks’, a wide range of \nother educational resources, under the category ‘textbook’ or \n‘supplemental material’, are addressed in the research process; \nteachers’ editions, advanced placements, DVD, CD, Websites, curricula, \nhandouts and teacher training are the main instances (Tobin and Ybarra \n2008, 164). All this material can be a legitimate choice of investigation if \nthere is a reasonable justification but it does not allow the research to \nuse the related findings for the sake of a claim made for the textbook.\n- Along the lines of the afore-mentioned point about a failure to define the \nlimits of the data sources, no time period is introduced as a limit to \nselection of items for the analysis.\n- The subjects chosen for the investigation might be considered too broad:\nthe textbook in History, Social Studies and Geography.\n- Content analysis is introduced as the main method to conduct the \nresearch. It is mentioned, as well, that other methods, personal \ninterviews and participant observations, are used. No explanation has \nbeen given in the book about why and/or how these methods are used or \ncombined in the research (Tobin and Ybarra 2008, 163–4).\n- Another short - coming is related to an explanation that clarifies how \ntwenty-eight textbooks are selected for analysis; they are described as \nthe most adopted textbooks but nothing is presented to justify this claim.\n- No theory is introduced as the basis of the research\n75 | P a g e\nThe areas of concern in this investigation include four main ones: ‘Jewish \nhistory, theology, and religion’, ‘The relationship between Judaism and \nChristianity’, ‘The relationship between Judaism and Islam’ and ‘The history, \ngeography, and politics of the Middle East’ (Tobin and Ybarra 2008, 164). A \nnumber of factors are identified in this research as those contributing to the \ntextbook problem. References are made to publishers, writers and interest \ngroups, but considerable effort is made to avoid mentioning a particular party as \nthat responsible for the problem. The same approach is noticeable when \ntextbooks are mentioned; no specific textbook is mentioned as worse than any \nother/s. At odds with this approach to avoid blaming a particular publisher, book \nor writer for the problems identified, Islamic/Arab interest groups are accused as \nmainly responsible for wrong - doing in textbook production, for what has been \ndescribed as ‘promoting a particular agenda’ (Tobin and Ybarra 2008, 155). \n‘The Council on Islamic Education’ is mentioned repeatedly as a problem \nresponsible for what went wrong. Writers of the book explicitly suggest that this \ngroup should be excluded from the process: ‘Both publishers and educators \nneed to be able to better distinguish between advocacy groups that work for \nhistorical accuracy such as the American Jewish Committee and the Institute for \nCurriculum Services (ICS) on the one hand, and groups promoting a particular \nagenda such as the Council on Islamic Education (CIE) or Arab World and \nIslamic Resources (AWAIR) on the other’ (Tobin and Ybarra 2008, 156).\nA PhD thesis, ‘Framing the Israel/Palestine Conflict in Swedish History School \nTextbooks, was produced in the University of Gothenburg that reaches a \nremarkable peak among all the relevant sources which I have found in the area \nof textbook treatment of the Israel/Palestine question. It might represent the \nonly detailed examination of this topic in a Western country. In addition to its \ntopic, it has other significant characteristics that introduce it as an important \nwork in related literature. The researcher, Michael Walls, identified a problem in \nSwedish History textbooks where textbook knowledge about Israel/Palestine \nshows no sign of a reasonable link with related scholarly knowledge (Walls \n2010, 313). He found this at odds with traditional Swedish neutrality that \nprovides an environment for unbiased treatment of the question (Walls 2010, \n13). However, a different treatment is recognized that forms a real problem: the \npower/knowledge problem (Walls 2010, 13). He analysed twenty Lower \n76 | P a g e\nSecondary school Swedish History textbooks and thirteen interviews with Social \nScience/Civics teachers to answer a key related question; ‘How the \nIsrael/Palestine conflict is framed in Swedish History school textbooks and how \nit compares to established scholarly debate on the conflict and teacher \ndiscourses’ (Walls 2010, 13). Why this combination, of textbook and interview is \na right choice is not elaborated adequately in the thesis. The theoretical \nfoundation of the research is rich and deals with the scholarly debate on critical \nstudies of the curriculum. In this regard it states; ‘Reflecting different \napproaches, the theoretical framework adopted here sees the construction, \nselection and organization of school knowledge as a political and \npower/knowledge problem’ (Walls 2010, Abstract). This can be problematized: if \nschool knowledge is political why should the power/knowledge question be \nconsidered a problem? The first part of the statement introduces the relation as \na natural one instead of as problematic. Another problematic matter that can be \nrecognized in this theoretical stance is the way ideology and discourse are\ndiscussed. There is a reference to the shift from ideology to discourse in \nFoucault’s critique of ideology. Foucault pointed out that defining ideology as \n‘false consciousness’ or a concept close to this implies that there is a truth that \ncan be accessed if ideological assumptions are revealed or political influence is \nsuspended. He, as a solution, suggested the concept of discourse that is \nadopted in this research to deal with the subject; at the same time the \nemployment of ideology, as a key term, is not abandoned; ‘ideological \nassumptions’ are considered a source of the problem that this investigation \nexplores. The research is informed by Crawford & Foster who state that \ntextbook knowledge can have a claim to truth, but not be the truth itself (Walls \n2010, 68–9). What they have added in this regard, that ‘such claims to truth in \nthe form of educational knowledge have to be understood in relation to the \nlocal/global (historical) cultural, political and market-economic context within \nwhich they are situated’ (Walls 2010, 68–9) inspires us to take more factors into \nconsideration and not only that of power and the political. There is nothing \nabout how this conflict is dealt with in this research. The author also introduces \na useful discussion about other concepts, such as hegemony, that Marxist/neo \nMarxist analysts use in educational studies, and the role intellectuals play, \naccording to Gramsci to maintain the hegemony of the dominant class. In \nrelation to method, discourse analysis is taken as the main method to analyse \n77 | P a g e\nthe textbook contents. For that purpose a set of categories and operational \ncodes are designed. The main categories are headlined as follows:\n ‘Ideological function: Which information is presented as objective or \ntaken-for-granted: presented as ‘truth’ and which unstated background \ninformation or tacit assumptions might be inferred?\n Interdiscursivity/intertextuality: connected to the above, which discourses \nconverge in the framing of the textbook content and teachers’ \nstatements, tacitly or explicitly?\n Which of these are more established (hegemonic) and which are more \nmarginalized? (Walls 2010, 119)’\nLater all texts under investigation are coded on the basis of the identified \ncategories. This provides a chance for the researcher to explore the main \ntendency/framing of the discourses presented in the textbook/teacher \nstatements. When this was completed, Walls concluded: ‘the linkages between \nscholarship, textbooks and teachers’ statements in general have been very \nweak and do not provide a platform for a broad critical understanding of the root \ncauses of the conflict on the basis of varying perspectives. Instead, they are far \ntoo anchored in ideological assumptions’ (Walls 2010, 6). Before analysing his \ndata, Walls reviews the related literature to demonstrate what has been done in \nthis field. His main area of focus, at this stage, is research conducted in Israel to \nanalyse Israeli/Palestinian textbooks. He also refers to research he found about \nthe subject in Sweden: ‘Det är en annan historia… vilken historia ger vi våra \nelever? This essay is designed to examine ‘how the history of the Middle East is \nmediated in teaching aids for History’ (Walls 2010, 26) through analysing four \nSwedish upper secondary textbooks. The essay is written in Swedish. The \nreview Walls presents about the essay introduces the result: ‘At the same time \nthey (authors of the above essay) offer a critique of the four textbooks they \nexamined in which they argue that “unfortunately a concentration on concrete \nproblems is absent”. One of the problems they feel ought to be looked at is the \nmatter of “the Jews’ demand for a national territory” and the issue, as they \ndefine it, of “why the Palestinians had to pay for the crimes of the Nazis with \nregard to the crimes against Jews during the Second World War” (Walls 2010, \n28).\n78 | P a g e\nA year later, 2011, Michael Walls, published the results of his academic \nresearch in an online newsletter, Dissident Voice. In this article he stressed the \nSwedish government’s neutral policy under Olaf Palme and even under the \nmore pro-Israeli government of Göran Perssontowards that is at odds with how \nSwedish textbooks frame Israel/Palestine history. In this regard he mentions the \nhistory of 1948 where new historians brought new perspectives that even find a \nplace in Israeli textbooks: ‘For example, since the 1980s and prior to that, \ndiscussions between so-called “new historians”, traditionalists and anti\u0002traditionalists have touched on topics such as Zionism’s political and ideological \n(and colonial) moorings, the concept of ‘transfer’ and how the Palestinian \nrefugee problem was created. However, such discussions have been \ncontinually absent in the Swedish History school textbooks examined. \nInterestingly too, excerpts from such critical works as Benny Morris’ Righteous \nVictims even made it into Israeli History school textbooks around the Oslo \nperiod (but were removed when Ariel Sharon came into office in 2000)’ (Walls \n2011).\nOne book published in this year (2011), confirms the existence of a problem in \nAmerican education when it is about teaching Palestine. ‘The Politics of \nTeaching Palestine to Americans: Addressing Pedagogical Strategies’ stressed \nthe point that teaching Palestine in American schools does not encourage a \nconstructive involvement in the Israel/Palestine question and reinforces the \ntreatment of the question in favour of the powerful side. This book sees \nindoctrination of American youth with Zionist mythology as a problem, and tries \nto provide ideas for dealing with that (Knopf-Newman 2011). This book does not \ninvolve an empirical investigation of American textbooks; it takes Zionist \nmythology as a problem and goes further to explain its consequences and offer \nways to solve such a problem.\nAn MA thesis was produced in Cedarville University in 2011 to examine how \ndepiction of the Arab-Israeli conflict has changed in US history textbooks since \nthe 1950’s. As claimed in this present literature review, no research has been \nconducted in the US, prior to this, which focuses exclusively on how American \ntextbooks treat the Arab-Israeli question (A. L. Smith 2011, 40). To answer the \nmain question of the research, how have descriptions of the Arab-Israeli conflict \n79 | P a g e\nchanged in US high school history textbooks since the 1950’s (A. L. Smith \n2011, 1), the time limitation of the research, from the 1950’s to the present \n(2000’s), is divided into six time periods of six succeeding decades. Three \ntextbooks are selected for each decade that belong to three leading textbook \npublishers. The content analysis conducted to examine these books is \nconsidered qualitatively and quantitatively, in order to, as the researcher puts it, \n‘highlight whether there has been more or less emphasis on particular events \nover time, and to identify major patterns and changes in the Arab-Israeli conflict, \nand the political, social, and educational implications of those changes’ (A. L. \nSmith 2011, Abstract). For such analysis an operational concept, a key event, \nhas been defined. A key event, according to this research, is an event, term or \nperson related to the conflict ‘if more than one textbook made reference to it’ (A. \nL. Smith 2011, 44). In this way key events include\n‘the British mandate period in Palestine, the Balfour Declaration and \nestablishment of Israel as a nation, the 1956 Suez Canal crisis, the 1967 \nSix Day War, the 1973 Yom Kippur War, the 1979 Camp David Accords, \nthe 1980s conflict in Lebanon, the 1991- 1994 peace talks, and post 9/11 \nArab-Israeli conflicts. Key people included Yasir Arafat, Menachem \nBegin, David Ben-Gurion, Golda Meir, Gamal Abdel Nasser, Yitzhak \nRabin, and Anwar Sadat. Key terms included Arab(s), Israel and/or \nIsraeli, Jews and/or Jewish, Palestine, and Palestinian’ (A. L. Smith \n2011, 44). \nAlso a list of books, mainly college textbooks about the history of the question, \nis given, as the authoritative sources that have been consulted for accessing \nknowledge of the question. This list includes a number of the most adopted \ntextbooks that have been extracted from the survey conducted for the sake of \nthis research (details will come in the next chapter), including: \n Bickerton, I., & Klausner, C. (2005). A concise history of the Arab\u0002Israeli conflict\n Gelvin, J. (2005). The Israel-Palestine conflict: One hundred years of \nwar\n Gilbert, M. (2005). The Routledge Atlas of the Arab-Israeli conflict\n Smith, C. (2010). Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict\n80 | P a g e\nTwo categories are designed to evaluate all analysed textbooks; the first one \nallocates a rating from 1 to 3 to three textbooks of each decade. 3 is awarded to \nthe textbooks that covered the subject more thoroughly and covered, better \nthan others, events that are relevant to the history of the question. 1, in contrast, \nis allocated to the one that is less successful in doing that job. All these \ntextbooks, also, are evaluated for pro-Israeli or pro-Palestinian bias. If one \ntextbook shows no sign of such bias it is put in a third category, neutral (A. L. \nSmith 2011, 48). Although a lot of work has been done to elaborate such a \nsizeable and innovative topic, there are some points that challenge the way the \nsubject is treated in this research; firstly the way the selection process is \nelaborated does not justify the position of those chosen as the most adopted \ntextbooks in the US. Furthermore, the research is not critical enough when \ndealing with textbooks; it takes the dominant college textbooks as the absolute \nlimits of the related knowledge, and then defines ‘key events’ only in the \nframework of what textbooks produce. Here, for instance, the possibility of \nignoring a key event by the most adopted American textbooks is not taken into \nconsideration. At the same time, the way textbooks are categorized in this study \nis not, I believe, a better solution for dealing with controversial and politically hot \ntopics. In such situations, transparency and providing the arguments involved \nand evidence might work better than relying on researchers’ judgments and \ntheir evaluations to establish the classes to which different textbooks should be \nassigned.\n81 | P a g e\nThe Results of the Relevant Research into How the Israel/Palestine \nQuestion Has Been Treated in Western Textbooks:\nIn the first section of this literature review all research that might be relevant to \nthe topic of this thesis has been reviewed in general. It has been tried, through \nthat section, to provide the necessary information about the main features of the \npresented pieces of research including their theoretical foundation, the methods \nthey used and the structure of the research that has been offered through a \ncritical approach. This section, the second one, is dedicated to the findings of \nthose works in the investigated area, the Israel/Palestine question. In this way, \nusing a chronological order, again, the results, which involve, frequently, a claim \nabout a governing bias in textbook content, and are supported with arguments \nand evidence, are reviewed in this section.\nGlenn Perry, who wrote ‘Treatment of the Middle East in American High School \nTextbooks’ (1975) makes a strong claim about the pro-Israel bias of American \ntextbooks where nothing could be found in the Arabs’ favour: ‘I found no book \nwhich could be considered even slightly biased in the Arabs' favour’ (Perry \n1975). In his conclusion, he considers the Arab-Israeli conflict as a main area of \nbias in dealing with the Middle East: ‘The result is not only a great deal of \nmisinformation but also - whether from malice or a simple lack of knowledge -\nbiased accounts of certain subjects, especially the Arab-Israeli conflict’ (Perry \n1975). He supports his claims with some arguments; ‘I might note that even the \n\"basically objective\" books strengthen the Zionist case by at least implying that \nthe modern Jews - instead of being a religious group of heterogeneous racial \nand ethnic backgrounds - are literally the same people as the ancient Israelites’ \n(Perry 1975). In reference to another case he asserts; ‘Thus the conception that \nthe Zionist is \"returning\" to his real \"homeland\" is uncritically accepted’ (Perry \n1975). Or ‘For instance, the establishment of Israel is briefly described, with a \nflashback on the history of Palestine which entirely omits the Arab period. The \ncountry was thus presumably uninhabited from the dispersion of the Jews until it \nwas \"returned to them’ (Perry 1975). He also argues: ‘books in a second \ncategory are considered biased because they simply neglect to explain why the \nPalestinians (if they mention that Palestinians exist) and other Arabs might, \nfrom their point of view, oppose Zionism and Israel’ (Perry 1975). Perry \n82 | P a g e\nreproduces some statements from textbooks that support what he claims; \n‘Another book explains the problem as being the result of Israel's \"relatively high \nstandard of living, which caused envy and discontent among the Arab peasants’ \n(Perry 1975). The following are other instances:\n ‘But the Jews \"found a poor, barren, desolate country\" until they, with \na \"tremendous expenditure of labour and money,\" turned it into \"an \noasis of Western civilization in the Middle East’ (Perry 1975).\n ‘Part of the [Arab] opposition [to Israel] arose from the reappearance \nof ancient Moslem hatred of infidels, and part from the fact that, to \nMoslems, the Jews represented Western power’ (Perry 1975).\nGriswold is another researcher who supports the claim that there is a pro-Israeli \nbias where American textbooks treat the Middle East. He takes the Arab-Israeli \nwars to examine how textbooks treat the Middle East. In relation to 1948, he \nstates; ‘Few relate the events by which mostly European immigrants \nestablished a new state in a land populated predominantly by Arabs. No text \nparallels the victories of the outnumbered Zionists in 1948 with the agonies \nsuffered by Palestinian Arabs, such as the killing at the village of Deir Yassin’ \n(Griswold 1975). Referring to another fascinating case he mentions the \nassassination of the UN ambassador by Zionists: ‘little note is made of the \npremeditated murder by Zionists of the United Nations ambassador, Count \nBernadotte; indeed several authors, using the passive voice, may even lead \nstudents to attribute the murder to Palestinians’... ‘As for the more than one \nmillion war refugees, one author views them as a “problem [which] plagued the \nnew state of Israel . . . “ Few authors explain the Palestinian refugee question \nas fundamental to any peace settlement, observing rather, as did a Canadian \nauthor, how much wiser the Israelis have been in absorbing Jewish refugees, \nwhereas the Arabs refuse to accept Palestinians’ (Griswold 1975, 22). Griswold \nmakes a powerful point here: ‘How useful, at this point, would have been an \nexplanation that hearth and home to a displaced Palestinian happens to be the \nsame spot on the earth as that currently occupied by a displaced Jew’ (Griswold \n1975, 23). In relation to the 1967 war, when Israel attacked Arab neighbouring \ncountries and occupied a considerable part of them, Griswold elaborates how \nthis is treated as well; ‘The Six Day War of June 1967 “broke out” in some texts’ \n(Griswold 1975, 24). He makes clear that ‘Most assert the Israeli view that war \n83 | P a g e\nbegan when President Nasser ordered out the UNEF troops from Egypt and \nblockaded the Gulf of Aqaba’ (Griswold 1975, 24).\nAl-Qazzaz who wrote ‘Textbooks and Teachers’ concludes; ‘Nowhere does this \nproblem of bias, distortion, omission, and misrepresentation appear to be more \nacute than in the material available on the Middle East. The dimensions of this \nproblem have been clearly recognized by scholars, and as the various studies \naptly demonstrate, much revision is needed in order to correct this situation’ (Al\u0002Qazzaz 1981, 81).\nJacobs in his article ‘Teaching the Arab World: Evaluating Textbooks’ refers to \nfive areas of concern that have been identified by evaluators of American \ntextbooks. Number four states that ‘Exposition of the Arab-Israeli conflict often \ncomes out as Arab equals-bad, Israeli equals-good’ (Jacobs 1981).\nVan de Ven in her PhD thesis, State Adoption Policies, Publishing Practices, \nand Authorship, refers to bias she identified in textbooks’ treatment of the \nquestion but she believes that this bias is representative of US textbook \ntreatment of all non-Western regions. She mentions the way non - Western \nnations are described in American textbooks; ‘Illiterate Iranians, ‘determined \nIsraelis, “warlike and aggressive Turks,” and “backward Iraq’ simplify the \ndelineation of what Americans view as good and evil, and right and wrong’ (van \nde Ven 1990, 33). In comparison she mentions the way American textbooks \ntreat Israel; ‘Macmillan, for example, conveys Israel’s moral standing without the \nuse of factual information; “Israel’s success story is one of a young, progressive \ncountry that continues to honor the time-honored traditions of its people” (van \nde Ven 1990, 33). The Arab-Israeli political controversy is summed up in \nGlobe’s description: “Of all the problems faced by this tiny desert nation, the \nmost serious is the hatred shown by its Arab neighbors, “Tiny” Israel and the \n“hatred” of the Arabs suggest a pattern of vulnerability and aggression, without \nthe support of factual information’ (van de Ven 1990, 33–34). Or when it comes \nto its conflict with non Western countries, the story is portrayed in a biased way: \n‘religious differences are cited as the cause of the Arab-Israeli and Iran-Iraq \nwars. Repeated referral to the Arab-Israeli conflict as a struggle between \nMuslim and Jew steers analysis away from the issues of land and political \nsovereignty’ (van de Ven 1990, 38–39). She further explains how this conflict is \n84 | P a g e\ntreated: ‘Factual accounts of the Arab-Israeli conflict are selective, fuelling the \nmistaken assumption that at the heart of the issue is the loss of land by both \nsides. Scott Foresman writes that, “Arabs and Israelis each believed that they \nhad wrongfully lost parts of their lands … What follows from this contention is \nthe portrayal of the Arabs as historic aggressors… Indeed, the same text recalls \nthat, on the very day Israel become free, six Arab armies attacked it. Since \nthen, Israel’s boundaries have changed numerous times as a result of wars with \nArab nations’ (van de Ven 1990, 39). Van de Ven mentions another textbook \nwith the same treatment: ‘Holt pursues the same line of argument. The 1948 \nArab invasion of Israel “was only the first of many invasions and raids launched \nby Israel’s neighbors” (van de Ven 1990, 40)’. In a position that can be \nunderstood as supporting Israeli annexation of the Occupied West Bank, \nBethlehem is introduced as a town in Israel (van de Ven 1990, 41). When \ntextbooks are talking about population in Israel they ignore Arabs or the existing \ndiscrimination against them; ‘Many people in Israel are Arabs. They have the \nsame rights as Jews. Prentice Hall goes into detail as it focuses upon Israel’s \nethnic diversity, referring to Ashkenazie and Sephardic Jews, but neglecting to \ninclude non-Jews as part of the Country’s ethnic make-up’ (van de Ven 1990, \n41). In relation to Israel’s military operation against its adversaries, what is \nrelated to Israel is justified but what is about its adversaries is portrayed in a \ndifferent image: ‘The same text pursues its argument for the legitimacy of \nmilitary action as a means of achieving Israeli interests by stating that “it took \ntwo more wars before the canal was open to Israel”. The rationality of these \nMiddle Eastern wars is thus implied. Finally, Israel’s participation in raids \nagainst the PLO is legitimized in the context of self-defence, while PLO raiding \nfalls under the label of terrorism. “The PLO often resorts to raids against Israel. \nThe Israelis fight back to prevent terrorist raids and to retaliate against attacks \nthey cannot prevent” (van de Ven 1990, 47)’.\nMitchell Bard’s text, ‘Rewriting History in Textbooks’ was the first research \nfound that supports a claim for the existence of an anti-Israeli bias in American \ntextbooks. After examining American textbooks he contends that ‘inadequate \nand inaccurate depictions of Middle East history are the norm’ (Bard 1993). In \nrelation to anti-Israeli bias he asserts: \n85 | P a g e\n‘The anti-Israel bias is usually a result of factual inaccuracy, \noversimplification, omission and distortion. Common errors include \ngetting dates of events wrong, blaming Israel for wars that were a result \nof Arab provocation, perpetuating the myth of Islamic tolerance of Jews, \nminimizing the Jewish aspect of the Holocaust, apologizing for Arab \nautocrats, refusing to label violence against civilians as terrorism and \nsuggesting that Israel is the obstacle to peace. Some of the most flagrant \nexamples that occur in more than one book are the failure to mention \nthat Syria and Egypt launched a surprise attack in 1973 on Israel's \nholiest day, Yom Kippur, and that Iraq fired SCUD missiles at Israel \nduring the 1991 Gulf War. The books in this study were so poorly written \nthat all but one require major revisions’ (Bard 1993). \nHe see this situation as a dangerous one due to possible effects it can have on \nAmerican students and leaders of the future: ‘The conclusions students are \nmost likely to draw from these presentations are those held by Israel's \ndetractors; therefore, it should not be surprising if students are easily \nencouraged to believe the worst about Israel when they reach politicized college \ncampuses. Even more worrisome is the likelihood that future American leaders \nwill have their earliest political attitudes toward Israel shaped by misinformation’ \n(Bard 1993). He notices some errors to support his claim; ‘Here are a few \nexamples of factual inaccuracies: T. Walter Wallbank and Arnold Schrier start \ntheir chapter on the Middle East in Living World History (Scott, Foresman and \nCo., 1990) with a photo captioned: \"the Amal fighters of the Palestine Liberation \nOrganization keep watch over Beirut.\" Amal is an organization of Lebanese \nShiite Muslims that fought with the PLO. Paul Thomas Welty and Miriam \nGreenblatt, in The Human Experience-World Regions and Cultures (Glencoe, \n1992), say the PLO was expelled from Jordan in 1971 rather than 1970. In the \nearlier edition of The Human Experience-A World History (Merrill 1990, 1992), \nMounir Farah and Andrea Karls wrote that the Arabs attacked a \"few days\" after \nIsrael declared independence. The 1992 edition correctly states that the \ninvasion occurred within 24 hours’ (Bard 1993). These minor errors are mostly \nuncontroversial. Problems start when he comes to the major issues. He \nopposes mentioning that the land had inhabitants that were forced out when \nJewish immigrants came to the land; \n86 | P a g e\n‘The coverage of the Arab-Israeli conflict is particularly abysmal. Much of \nthe crucial history of Palestine before 1948 is omitted, particularly from \nthe U.S. history books. Those texts that discuss the mandatory period \npresent the Arab version of history; that is, an unrestrained flood of \nJewish immigrants invaded a land already inhabited by another people, \nwho were subsequently forced out. The historical Jewish presence in the \ncountry is usually ignored’ (Bard 1993).\nOther similar points are made; ’The treatment of the causes and conduct of the \nArab-Israeli wars in all the texts was appalling. The complexities of the conflict \nare usually reduced to the Palestinians wanting independence and Israel \nresisting. The Arabs' refusal to accept a Jewish state in their midst is softened \nto an unwillingness to \"recognize\" Israel, a subtle difference that suggests \npassivity rather than an active campaign to destroy Israel’ (Bard 1993).\nElizabeth Barlow is another researcher whose work on the topic, Evaluation of \nSecondary-Level Textbooks for Coverage of the Middle East and North Africa, \nhad a great impact on relevant literature. She stated that what has been \npresented about Israel in American textbooks is mainly from the Israeli view \n(Morgan 2002, 44). She gives instances to support this claim: mentioning \ntextbook references to the Balfour Declaration as a source of promise for a \nJewish homeland but failing to consider the other part of the declaration about \nthe rights of non-Jews in the Holy Land (Morgan 2002, 44–45). Or in another \ncase, on why Palestinians opposed the establishment of Israel, she argues that \nmany textbooks do not mention how Palestinians’ loss of their land is related to \nthe Jewish immigration to the Holy Land. She also refers to the 1967 war that \nIsrael started and refers to textbooks that introduce Egypt as the starter of that \nwar (Morgan 2002, 45).\nAl-Bataineh in his PhD thesis ‘The Development of a Content Analysis \nInstrument for Analysing College-Level Textbooks Used in The United States to \nTeach about the Middle East’ refers to bias as a problem of American textbooks \nwhen treating the Middle East. He recognizes that on the evidence of most \nstudies in this area: ‘Most of these studies have substantially supported the \nhypotheses that American history textbooks present distorted images, biases, \n87 | P a g e\nand stereotypes about the people of the Middle East’ (Al-Bataineh 1998, 19–\n20).\nHani Morgan in her PhD thesis, ‘The Portrayal of The Middle East in School \nTextbooks from 1880 to The Present’ that discussed four different periods of\ntime in relation to American textbooks’ treatment of the Middle East, came to \nthe conclusion: \n‘Although the later books are in general less biased than the earlier ones \nand begin to talk about the oppression by Europeans, they often treat \nother political issues in a biased way. As Chapter 1 suggested, various \nbooks from the later period describe the Arab-Israeli conflict in a biased \nway and leave out important details; thus readers are led to believe that \nthe Arabs are hostile and responsible for many angles of the conflict that \nthey are not responsible for. Some books also repeatedly make \ncomparisons between the Arab countries and Israel, and emphasize \nIsrael’s superiority without stating relevant facts’ (Morgan 2002, 174–\n175).\nMarvin Wingfield & Bushra Karaman in a journal article, ‘Arab Stereotypes and \nAmerican Educators’ stated: ‘American textbooks are often Eurocentric’ \n(Wingfield and Karaman 2002). They made clear why they say this: ‘Arab points \nof view regarding such issues as the nationalization of resources or the Arab\u0002Israeli conflict are presented inadequately or not at all’ (Wingfield and Karaman \n2002).\nElizabeth Marie Brockway in her thesis, ‘The Portrayal of the Middle East in \nSecondary School U.S Textbooks’ comes to the conclusion: ‘junior and senior \nhigh school textbooks used in the United States provided a negatively biased \nportrayal of the Middle East through word use, omission, and the presentation \nof inadequate information’ (Brockway 2007, 70). In relation to the Arab-Israeli \nconflict, ‘some of the textbooks did not allude to the justification of both Israelis \nand Palestinians to the disputed land, leading students to believe that the land \nbelonged to the Jews (since they do control the land now). The textbooks did \nnot discuss the airlift that the United States provided to Israel that prevented the \nArab surprise attack in 1973 from succeeding; thus the books did not \n88 | P a g e\nadequately explain why OPEC temporarily halted oil shipments to the United \nStates (in response to the airlift). Without understanding that the United States \nand the West in general have actively been involved in the Middle East, many \ntimes without the popular support of the Middle Easterners, students would find \nit difficult to understand why the region is so hesitant to allow Western influence \nnow’ (Brockway 2007, 72).\nHani Morgan and David Walker in an article, ‘The Portrayal of the Middle East in \nFour Current School Textbooks’, which was published recently (2008) by the \nMiddle East Studies Association of North America (MESA), confirmed that the \nresearch conducted on the subject introduces bias as a main feature:\n‘Numerous researchers have analyzed the textbook treatment of the \nMiddle East and its people. Generally, it has been shown that texts often \npresent inaccurate and biased portrayals of this region consistent with \nexisting stereotypes. Although it may not have been the intent of the \nauthors of these textbooks to perpetuate stereotypes, this is the typical \noutcome of this type of portrayal’ (Morgan and Walker 2008). \nThey confirm, also, that those studies refer to a bias in relation to the Arab\u0002Israeli question; ‘Many of the studies report a bias against the Arab countries in \nthe Arab-Israeli conflicts (Barlow 1994, Griswold 1986. Jacobs 1981). These \nstudies report that textbooks often do not present the Palestinian perspective \nadequately in the Arab-Israeli conflict by neglecting to mention important facts \nsuch as how long the Palestinians lived in Palestine as the dominant people \nbefore it became modern day Israel’ (Morgan and Walker 2008). Their own \ntextbook analysis confirms the continuation of the situation; ‘This study \nsuggests that although there have been improvements in the portrayal of the \nMiddle East since the eighties and nineties, inaccuracies that misrepresent the \nculture, religion, and politics of the region still occur’ (Morgan and Walker 2008).\nKincheloe in ‘Knowledge and Critical Pedagogy’ also mentions other cases of \ntextbook treatment of the Middle East which are, according to him, in favour of \nIsrael (2008).\n89 | P a g e\nThe book written by Gary Tobin and Dennis R. Ybarra, The Trouble with \nTextbooks, is at odds with much research into the field and is in agreement with \nthe text by Mitchell Bard, ‘Rewriting History in Textbooks’ in claiming that \nAmerican textbooks treat Israel in a negative way, and reflect, in many cases, \nPalestinian narratives. A considerable figure, five hundred, suggested in the \nbook for problematic statements found in American textbooks, are classified in \ndifferent categories; ‘Arabs Want Peace—Israel Does not’ is one category, for \ninstance. Another one, ‘Who Put the Palestinian Refugees in Camps?’, blames\nArabs for the suffering of Palestinian refugees. The writers argue; ‘Some of the \ntextbooks strongly imply that Israel itself placed and kept Palestinian refugees in \nthe camps, in agreement with Palestinian beliefs. This has no defensible logic. \nThe idea that Israel, surrounded by hostile Arab governments and devoid of any \ninfluence there, could affect the Arab states’ refusal to integrate or resettle the \nPalestinians seems farfetched. These governments, with the exception of \nJordan, carried out a deliberate, cynical, and remarkably inhumane policy of \nkeeping the refugees in squalid camps on their territories so that the refugees \nwould serve as political pawns in world opinion to pressure Israel’ (Tobin and \nYbarra 2008, 124). In a related category, the writers blamed what is called \n‘Omission of Jewish Refugees’: ‘most textbooks make no mention of what \nessentially became a refugee exchange: hundreds of thousands of Jews, \nresidents of Arab countries for thousands of years, were expelled or chose to \nflee hostile anti-Semitic societies’ (Tobin and Ybarra 2008, 126). Another \ncategory, Denying the Jewish Connection to the Land of Israel, criticizes \ntextbook statements when they relate the land to Palestinians: ‘The coverage of \nMiddle East history and the Arab–Israeli dispute in textbooks and supplemental \nmaterials contains significant elements of the Arab narrative, which frames the \nconflict from Arab and Palestinian points of view’ (Tobin and Ybarra 2008, 91). \nIn another category, Making Excuses for Arab and Muslim Terrorism, they state: \n‘Many textbooks and some supplemental materials consistently reflect the Arab \nnarrative that seeks to push the widespread use of terrorism by the Palestinians \nagainst Israel far into the background’ (Tobin and Ybarra 2008, 129). In Chapter \nEight (Terrorism and Internal Conflict), textbooks referring to Zionist terrorism \nare criticized: \n90 | P a g e\n‘Textbooks do not adequately explain the founding of Israel as a moral \nredressing from the United Nations for the injustice of the Holocaust and \nthe need to fulfill the national aspirations of the Jewish people. Instead, \nits founding is reduced to the alleged selection of terrorism as a policy by \nIsraeli forces. Violence occurred but was rejected by most Jews as a \nstrategy, and most historians would agree it was the diplomatic and \npolitical efforts of Jewish and Gentile leaders that facilitated the \nestablishment of a Jewish state’ (Tobin and Ybarra 2008, 129). \nThe book concludes that; ‘The history of Israel reflects too many elements of \nthe Arab narrative without respect to historical accuracy’ (Tobin and Ybarra \n2008, 154). These textbooks are considered; Anti-Christian, Anti-Semitic and \nAnti-Israel.\nAs earlier implied, the academic research on Swedish textbooks, titled ‘Framing \nthe Israel/Palestine Conflict in Swedish History School Textbooks’, can be fairly\nrecognized as an outstanding development in the relevant literature produced \non the subject. The research focused precisely on a study area that interests \nthis thesis; history textbooks used in a Western country (Sweden) are examined \nthoroughly to analyse how the Israel/Palestine question is treated. This \napproach to the study brought about a handful of useful results that can \ncontribute effectively to creating a knowledge map of the subject matter. It is \nworth mentioning the fact that the Swedish position on the question is among \nthe least pro-Israeli positions in Western countries and this should be taken into \nconsideration when such a map is perceived2. The results of the study are \npresented mainly in chapter 4 and 5 where the findings of the actual textbook \nanalysis are provided. Chapter 6 is useful as well but this chapter is about \n‘teacher discourses’ and not about textbooks themselves. Chapter 7, \nConcluding Discussions, contains a main part of the research’s overall results, \nand its conclusion.\nThis Swedish PhD research is based on the results of a pilot study, ‘Framing \nConflict and War in Lower Secondary School Books: Israel and Palestine’ that \n \n2\nThe Swedish position on the question is located close to that of a few Western countries such as \nIreland and Greece that are more critical of Israel than is any other Western country,\n91 | P a g e\nwas conducted earlier through examining four Swedish History textbooks \n(published between the period of the mid to late 1990s and early 2000s). The \npilot study found, that, as Walls put it: ‘the historical plight of the Jewish people \nis highlighted at the beginning of some of the sections I have analysed. \nHowever, the plight of the Palestinian Arabs is not highlighted in the same way. \nIsraelis are often presented as benign, victims, retaliatory not aggressive or \nviolent. Arab Palestinians are represented as aggressive, violent and somewhat \nirrational’ (Walls 2010, 17). Walls recognizes the underlying discourse of the \nexamined textbooks as based on the assumption that ‘Palestinians are \npredisposed to violence, while Israelis merely seek peace’ (Walls 2010, 17). He \naffirms that such a discourse ‘creates an impression which misleads and \nmisinforms, fostering prejudice and bias towards both parties’ (Walls 2010, 17). \nPresenting the results of this pilot study Walls adds: ‘I also discovered that \ncertain topics and themes were emphasised more than others in most of the \ntextbook chapters. For example, historical events such as the Nazi holocaust \nwould very often introduce the history of the conflict as would references to the \nJewish people’s biblical-historical connection to ancient Israel and their \nhistorical suffering. These topics and themes provided a context or framework \nfrom which to introduce and study the history of the conflict. An important part of \nthe Palestinian historical narrative, namely, the al-Nakba and the expulsion and \nflight of the Palestinian Arabs in 1948 also appeared in some of the textbooks \nsomewhere in the middle of a text. Briefly mentioned in the textbooks, this event \nprovided more or less the only back-drop to the plight of the Palestinian-Arabs’ \n(Walls 2010, 18). Walls also shares his findings about the images involved; \n‘Another finding I made too referred to positive and negative biases in the form \nof reductive images or one-dimensional roles ascribed to both parties to the \nconflict. For example, references which reinforced certain stereotypes were the \nimage of Israelis as victims, as reinforced by the references to the Nazi \nholocaust and historical Jewish suffering, and the Palestinians as aggressors or \nrejectionists, with references to the Arab rejection of the 1947 Partition Plan and \nthe reaction of the Arab states to the establishment of Israel in 1948’ (Walls \n2010, 18). Walls makes a connection with the results of his PhD thesis when \nthe results of the pilot study are presented; ‘Examination of the History textbook \nchapters for this thesis has more or less confirmed a repetition of the above with \na number of important exceptions’ (Walls 2010, 18).\n92 | P a g e\nIn Chapter Four (Making Connections and Constructing Causes), the first \nanalytical chapter of the thesis, treatment of the root causes and parties to the \nconflict is examined. This has been done through three sub chapters (sections):\n Establishing a Historical Connection to the Holy Land\n From the Balfour Declaration Onwards\n Partition, 1948 and the Creation of the Refugee Problem\nIn the first section, Walls elaborates how Swedish textbooks treat the historical \nconnection of both conflicting parties, Israel and Palestine, to the land: \n‘The opening sections of the textbooks focus on a specific number of \ntopics and themes which, taken together, as Masalha puts it, form “an \nunbroken chain of [historical] presence” in the land. These selected \ntopics and themes function to construct a seamless connection between \nthe Jews or Jewish people of ancient Israel to the state of modern Israel \nand to a lesser extent the Arab Palestinians to ancient Canaan. This is \nachieved through an interdiscursive mingling of historical, biblical and \nnational topical and thematic references. The most poignant example of \nthis is the reference to modern Israel as the youngest and oldest state in \none of the textbooks. Other allusions to nationhood are made when \nJerusalem is referred to as the capital city of ancient Israel or Judea or \nwhen it is described as the original homeland of the Jews. To strengthen \nthis metahistorical connection further, reference is made to a 3000 -\nyear-old presence in the land and to the (national) Jewish remnant \nfollowing the expulsion of the Jewish people from ancient Jerusalem by \nthe Romans. We also learn that these same Jews were to emigrate to \nEurope, Africa and America following their exile into Diaspora. Other \ntopics and themes connected to the above are the universally embraced \ndream of return and the Nazi holocaust. Both of these interact with and \nare reinforced by the idea of nationhood and biblical mythhistory, to \nborrow Sand’ s phrase’ (Walls 2010, 152). \nAs Walls explains, almost everything to hand is used, not only weak or vague \nhistorical stories but also narratives that have no place in history borrowed from \nnational and religious myths to establish a connection between Jews and the \nland. On the contrary the obvious facts about the Palestinian connections to the \n93 | P a g e\nland were located in some twisted historical narratives; ‘Arab connection to the \nland is established generally in terms of the invasion of Palestine or their arrival \nas nomads in Palestine in the Middle Ages. In one textbook, a more \nmetahistorical Arab-Canaanite connection to the land is constructed. In general \ncontrast, however, the Jews of ancient Israel are not portrayed as arriving in \nPalestine but are always present in the land’ (Walls 2010, 152). Through this \nstrategy Swedish textbooks avoided presenting the obvious fact that the \nPalestinians were the owners of the land, when the Zionists claimed it, back to \nthe times in history that can be seen through existing evidence and documents \nwhich go to hundreds and even thousands of years ago. This is done, as Walls \nputs it, to establish a ‘natural connection’ and for an ‘equal claim’ to the land; \n‘However, arguably an “equal” claim to the land is tacitly invoked through the \n“natural” connections made between history, religion and nation established in \nthe textbooks. That is, through the discourse on Jewish/Arab connection to the \nland’ (Walls 2010, 153). Walls argues that the findings that come from teachers’ \ninterviews confirm, also, such a conclusion;\n‘Interestingly too, some of my interview respondents have invoked \nsuch a claim. To mention but a few, one respondent claimed that “the \nconflict is basically about both parties having a right to the land. \nAnother intoned that “both sides are right on that point.” Invoking the \nconnection discourse another teacher added that “a long time [had] \npassed” and then “they [the Jewish people] were able to return” \n(Walls 2010, 153).\nIn the ‘Discussion and Analysis’ of the next section (From the Balfour \nDeclaration Onwards), that has been developed to answer the question ‘How \nare the issues of Zionism, the Balfour Declaration, Britain’ s support and broken \npromises, immigration and increasing tensions treated?’ (Walls 2010, 177)\nWalls provides the results of his textbook examination: \n‘The general discursive framework for understanding these issues \nconsists of a number of interconnected topics and themes introduced \nthroughout the textbook chapters. First of all, in the opening sections, \nboth the construction of a Palestinian and Jewish connection to the land \nis established in the textbook chapters through, as Andersen puts it, “the \n94 | P a g e\nreimagining of an ancient religious community as a nation”. Themes such \nas religion and nationhood and topics connected to them provide a \ncommon-sense framework for understanding and explaining the histories \nof Jews and Arabs in Palestine. In turn, this supports the emergent and \nrecurrent notion of “equal” claim to the land. In addition, Jewish (meta) \nhistorical identity is constructed around the above topics and themes to \nseamlessly connect the modern Zionist movement and modern Israel to\n“the vast Diasporan centre” and ancient (biblical) Israel. In turn, the \npurpose of Zionism is not discussed in terms of its political (colonial) or \nideological moorings. Instead it is discussed in terms of a natural \nconnection between Judaism and Zionism and the latter’ s purpose to \nprovide a safe haven for Jews everywhere under the auspices of \nTheodor Herzl, following increased anti-Semitism in the late 19th century’ \n(Walls 2010, 177). \nRegarding Zionism, Walls argues later; ‘already discussed, the role and \npurpose of the Zionist movement is not placed in any critical light. Instead, it is \ndescribed as existing to return a persecuted Jewish people to its biblical\u0002historical (and national) homeland to create a haven for all Jews’ (Walls 2010, \n252). Walls clarifies how the Jewish presence is seen in the context of Jewish \nsuffering: \n‘The theme of historical Jewish suffering introduced in the opening \nsections of the textbooks (e.g. pogroms, ghettoisation, expulsions etc.) is \nreintroduced in the historical event of the extermination of six million \nEuropean Jews during the Nazi holocaust. This event acts as the \nsubsequent backdrop to the topic of Jewish immigration and the \nexplanatory framework for acts of Jewish terror in the wake of the 1939 \nWhite Paper along with allusions to British collaboration with the Arabs. \nIn addition, the shifting of the topic of Jewish immigration to the plight of \nHolocaust survivors pits the latter against the indigenous population and \nconstructs a difficult moral dilemma (e.g. whose plight should the reader \nadhere to the most)’ (Walls 2010, 178). \n95 | P a g e\nAs Walls points out, this creates a complicated problem and moral dilemma that \nlocates readers/students in a difficult position of ‘should one support the \nHolocaust survivors or the Arabs of Palestine?’ (Walls 2010, 174)\nThe last section of Chapter Four (Partition, 1948 and the Creation of the \nRefugee Problem), is guided by a main question; ‘How are the topics of the \npartition proposal, the 1948 war and the creation of the refugee problem treated \nin the textbooks examined above’? (Walls 2010, 192) The answer is; ‘I have \nalready discussed the general framework established in the textbooks in the \nopening sections of this chapter. Some of these are reinvoked in the treatment \nof the partition proposal in the textbooks too. For example, the historical event \nof the extermination of six million European Jews during the Nazi holocaust \nserves as part of the explanatory frame for understanding the purpose of \npartition. Partition is understood here to prevent the Holocaust from ever \nhappening again and to provide the Jewish people with a state of their own’ \n(Walls 2010, 192–193). What happened in 1948 constitutes another part of the \nanswer; \n‘The general framework discussed is also present in relation to the \ntopics of the 1948 war or “War of Independence” and the creation of \nthe refugee problem, including the idea of “equal” claim to the land. \nThis is mediated through among other things the employment of the \nterm independence to describe Israel’s defensive war against the \nArab states. As soon as the state of Israel is established and its \npolitical independence declared in the textbooks we learn that the \nArab states have launched an aggressive attack on it in order to \ndestroy it. The reasons given range from a non-desire to have a \nJewish state as a neighbour or a desire to have Palestine continue \nas an Arabic country. Bringing in the international law discourse, the \ncreation of the refugee problem is also treated in the textbooks. \nHowever, no direct connection is made to Israel’s own actions but \ninstead “the war” is ascribed an agentive role in causing either the \nflight or expulsion of the Palestine Arabs. The issue of Arab flight or \nexpulsion is treated as a contested one in the textbooks. Mention is \nmade of the fact that in defiance of international law the Palestinian \n96 | P a g e\nrefugees are not permitted to return to their homes occupied by Israel \nin 1949. Mitigating this, it is explained that these homes were needed \nto accommodate Jewish refugees expelled from Arab countries’ \n(Walls 2010, 193).\nThe next chapter (Chapter 5), Pivotal Conflicts and Processes of Peace, that \nconcentrate on the ‘key events of conflict and peace’ examines the textbook \ntreatments of the following matters; \n The June 67 War: Causes and Consequences\n Camp David I\n Contextualizing Occupation\n Intifada, Statehood and Peace\n The 1993 Oslo Peace Process\nEach matter is presented in a sub - category (section). In relation to the June \n‘67 war, the results of textbook examination demonstrate, as Walls puts it: ‘First \nof all, the seminal events or conflict triggers presented in the texts are among \nother things Egypt’s stopping of maritime traffic, the gathering of Egyptian \ntroops along the border and even the claim of an attack launched on Israel’ \n(Walls 2010, 208). One textbook makes a clear statement about this; ‘in 1967, \nEgypt and the other Arab states launched a new attack on Israel’ (Walls 2010, \n207). Regarding the lands Israel occupied in this war, Walls argues: ‘Israel’s \nvictory and occupation of the West Bank and Gaza (as well as the Golan \nHeights and the Sinai) is explained in terms of its security needs or as a \ndefensive act (a “counterattack”)’ (Walls 2010, 208). Beside this sympathetic \nposition towards Israel, the Palestinian ownership of the land is treated very \ndifferently; ‘In the next paragraph we learn that “the Palestinians wanted back \nthe land that they felt was theirs”. Echoing the framework examined in previous \ntextbook chapters, the nature of Palestinian or local Arab ownership of the land \nis reduced to a strongly-felt desire or claim’ (Walls 2010, 208). Comparison \nbetween such a statement and that which textbooks produce about Israel’s \nconnection to the land, one based, mainly, on stories about a time not very far \nfrom the pre - historical period, when nothing notable is registered properly so\nthat it can be used as historical evidence, is a strategy that can be helpful. In \naddition, Walls suggests another interesting point about the occupied land when \n97 | P a g e\nsaying: ‘Although mentioned from time to time, perhaps one of the least covered \ncontexts presented in the textbooks is that of the Israeli occupation in the post \n‘67 war period despite the fact that there exists an abundance of information \nfrom various sources such as human rights organisations, NGOs etc.’ (Walls \n2010, 217). As Walls shows, this occupation is justified through other ways in \nSwedish textbooks; ‘Palestinian people still do not have a land of their own' \n(Walls 2010, 221). The reason for this we discover is that Israel “has refused to \nreturn the West Bank and the other areas conquered in 1967”. Following this, \nan explanation is provided for Israel’s refusal which has to do with “water \nshortages”. This we learn “is an important reason for why Israel intends to keep \nthe West Bank” because “Israel gathers much of its drinking-water from the \noccupied West Bank”. Previously in the same textbook we learn that the \nreasons for Israeli occupation have to do with “security”. Thus the textbook \nestablishes the mitigating hurdles toward ending the occupation as Israeli \nsecurity and Israeli water shortages but not the occupation itself’ (Walls 2010, \n221). In relation to the Intifada, Walls found; ‘Generally speaking, while the \nbeginning of the first Intifada is connected to Palestinian actions it is only \nvaguely connected to the Israeli occupation through such slogans as \n“humiliation and repression” or a “desperate situation”. The tendency, then, is to \nfocus on Palestinian violence as the general trigger and Israeli retaliation as the \ngeneral response. The Israeli occupation itself is not described as a direct \ncause of conflict or even as a direct act of violence which Palestinians would \nrespond or retaliate to’ (Walls 2010, 230). Walls introduces the ‘equal claim’ to \nthe land as an order of discourse that prevails in the textbook narratives when \nthey are about the land; \n‘As I previously discussed, I have identified the “equal” claim \ndiscourse framing the textbook narratives as the intersection \nbetween the Oslo discourse, language and perspectives from the \ninternational law discourse and the Jewish/Arab connection to the \nland discourse. Simultaneously, the “equal” claim discourse is \nmaintained through the exclusion of critical international law \nperspectives pertaining to the Israel/Palestine conflict’ (Walls 2010, \n245). \n98 | P a g e\nHe adds; \n‘Within this order of discourse it is understood that the parties to the \nconflict have an “equal” claim or right to the land on the basis of \nreligious and/or national connection. This order of discourse \nessentially trumps the references to the international law discourse \nappearing in the textbooks. For example, given the assumption that \nboth parties share an “equal” claim to the land, such condemnations \nby the UN on the status of Jerusalem are subordinated to the \nassumed claim. “Equal” claim also gains its authority through the \nexclusion of broader perspectives from the international law \ndiscourse discussed above which, as I discussed, trumps any \nideological claims to the land’ (Walls 2010, 246).\nIn Chapter 7, Concluding Discussion, the overall results of examining Swedish \ntextbooks are produced. The following statements come from this chapter and \nrepresent those that refer to a bias:\n ‘Thus, the dream of return is understood in the textbooks and \nteachers’ statements to actually mean the physical, political return of \nthe Jewish people metahistorically connected to the land’ (Walls \n2010, 298).\n ‘the notion of “equal” claim to the land provides the ideological glue \nand/or normative point of departure for linking and/or making sense of \nknowledge claims on the history of the conflict in teachers’ statements \nand in the textbooks’ (Walls 2010, 300).\n ‘It is understood throughout the textbook chapters that there is a meta \nhistorical connection between the Zionist settlers, Nazi holocaust \nsurvivors and the Jews of ancient biblical times since they are \nconsidered one and the same nation-people’ (Walls 2010, 301).\n ‘The occupation is never cast as a potential cause of the violence. \nInstead, cycles of violence are referred to whereupon is inferred that \nthese cycles of violence are often ignited by the Palestinians, for \nexample with the failure of the 2000 peace summit. More generally \ntoo there is a tendency to portray the Arab side as more prone to \naggressive and/or rejectionist actions; for example, through their \n99 | P a g e\nunequivocal intention to prevent the establishment of the state of \nIsrael or simply to destroy it. This image is contrasted, however, with \nreference to the plight and sentiments of the local Palestinian Arab \npopulation and tacit references to the Palestinian tragedy of 1948 or \nal-Naqba (an event which is never directly attributed to the actions of \nIsrael but to “the war”)’ (Walls 2010, 301–302).\n ‘The Israeli role of occupier is never directly referred to and neither is \nthe occupation itself described as a direct cause of the conflict. Nor is \nthe occupation even described as an act of violence which \nPalestinians would respond or retaliate to or even resist’ (Walls 2010, \n302).\n ‘Compared to coverage of other historical conflicts in the textbooks, \nthe Israel/Palestine conflict takes up very little space and is \nsometimes discussed as an adjunct to the Second World War or \nJewish history’ (Walls 2010, 137).\nOne section of this chapter is dedicated to ‘Pro-Israeli and Pro-Palestinian Bias \nand the Textbooks’ History’. Regarding the pro-Israeli bias that Swedish \ntextbooks exhibit, Walls suggests the following (his statement in full):\n ‘The points of pro-Israeli bias emerging in the textbooks are imparted \nfirst of all through a rendering of - Jewish History which begins in 70 \nCE with the destruction of the Second Temple. From there it \ncontinues to the creation of the 2000 year Jewish Diaspora or through \ndirect reference to the Nazi genocide and with that an explanation for \nwhy Israel was established. Furthermore, it is understood in the \ntextbooks and more so in teachers' statements that “Jewish History”\nand in particular the Nazi holocaust is the educational topic within \nwhich the Israel/Palestine conflict may be explained and understood. \nSecondly, the textbooks construct a notion of a homogenous, \nmetahistorical Jewish people in the Diaspora who have desired to \nreturn to their ancient homeland for 2000 years. Assuming a natural \nconnection between religion and nation, then, other aspects of \n“Jewish History” are emphasised too. For example, the perennial \nsuffering of the Jewish people since their dispersion from Jerusalem \ntwo millennia ago. Again, the pinnacle of this suffering is connected to \n100 | P a g e\nthe heinous genocide of six million European Jews during the Nazi \nholocaust. In connection with this event and historical suffering, the \ntextbooks mention the right to a homeland on the part of the Jewish \npeople (incidentally, a right which has been enshrined in international \nlaw since the 1940s in recognition of the rights of ethnic peoples). In \naddition, this right is naturally (ideologically) connected to an \nassumed biblical-national ― claim to the land invoked through such \nthemes as the dream of return. Furthermore, this claim is understood \nas ― equal to both parties to the conflict. Further pro-Israeli bias in \nconnection with the above relates to the identity constructs (as \nmentioned) and roles Jews or the Jewish people are ascribed. First of \nall, it is understood in the textbooks that Jews in general and Jewish\u0002Israelis in particular are the same people historically and \ncontemporaneously. Given their role as a persecuted people they \nhave had to defend their independence in Israel sometimes through \nbrutal retaliation in response to Palestinian or Arab threats to their \nexistence. Given this backdrop, such topics as political Zionism, \nvarious conflicts and peace processes are generally presented from \nan Israeli perspective. This functions in turn due to the fact that there \nis little or no orientation with the debate 1948 or other sources \ndiscussed here, albeit perhaps only with some of the perspectives \npresented by traditionalist historians’ (Walls 2010, 305).\nWalls also proposes the following items as evidence of the pro-Palestinian bias \nfound in Swedish textbooks (his statement in full):\n ‘Points of pro-Palestinian bias also appear repeatedly in the textbooks \nbut without an educational aegis such as “Jewish History” to contrast \nwith. First of all, the historical plight of the Palestinians is generally \nconnected to the events following the 1948 war. Possibly drawing on \nsome aspects of the debate discussed in Chapter One, it is discussed \nwhether the Palestinians were expelled or fled following the war. \nHowever, the question is left open and perhaps as a result no direct \ncausal connection to Israeli actions and the creation of the refugee \nproblem are discussed. On the other hand, mention is made of the\noccupation of Palestinian homes following the war and the plight of \n101 | P a g e\nthe Palestinians. Personal accounts are provided too through one \nteenage Palestinian girl who is forced to reside in refugee camps year \nafter year with her family. The PLO is sometimes portrayed too in its \npolitical role as a liberation organisation determined to win back the \nterritories lost in 1948. In one textbook in particular from 1991-92, a \nconnection is made between the continuing construction of illegal \nsettlements in the West Bank, Israeli security and the prevention of a \nPalestinian state. With regard to national rights, the textbooks \nemphasise the point that both the Palestinians and Israelis share an\n“equal” claim to the land. Albeit marginal, some contextualisation of \nthe reality of occupation is expressed through vague formulations \nsuch as “humiliation” and/or “suffering”. From that a tacit connection \nis also made to the beginnings of the 1987 or first Intifada or uprising. \nEven acts of terrorism and protest are contextualised in connection \nwith the suffering of Palestinians under occupation, although direct \nreference to the realities of the Israeli occupation is never made. I \nwould conclude that these differing biases emerging in the textbooks \nrepresent two opposing political and ideological positions of the \ndifferent textbook writers characterised by an ambition to be balanced \nand neutral. Arguably, too, such a confluence of different biases \nreflects the political and ideological culture within which the matter of \nthe conflict has been deliberated over the years between different \npower blocs. It is perhaps possible to conclude that the writers of the \ntextbooks have drawn both upon the established Swedish political \nconsensus or debate on the conflict and have perhaps been \ninfluenced by other external discourses. Very little, however, would \nindicate an orientation with scholarly sources. Given the lack of \nscholarly oversight which many Swedish school textbooks were \nreleased from in 1991 to be placed on the market, this is perhaps \nunsurprising’ (Walls 2010, 306–307).\nThis thesis started from an initial problem about the gap between textbook \nnarratives on the Palestine/Israel conflict and the scholarly sources. One \nsection, ‘Comparing scholarship and the textbooks’ is designed to formulate the \n102 | P a g e\nresults of the research in this area. The following items can represent the main \nfindings;\n ‘All in all, in connection with how the history of the conflict is \npresented in the scholarly debate, the version provided in the \ntextbooks is of a character more concerned with instilling an \nideological message than exploring the political and ideological roots \nof the conflict (albeit via a neutral language form that avoids explicitly \nadopting either bias discussed above). For example, generally \nspeaking while the textbooks rely on biblical myth and national \nideology as a point of departure, scholarship, whether on the history \nof the conflict or on Israeli and Palestinian textbooks, tends to \nproceed from a discussion of the political and ideological roots of the \nconflict’ (Walls 2010, 307). \n ‘Apart from the unique framework the Swedish textbooks proceed \nfrom, there is another significant difference between them and the \nscholarly literature and from time to time the Israeli textbooks \nthemselves. This difference concerns the manner in which the root \ncauses of the conflict are presented. In the Swedish textbooks we \nlearn that the conflict is about two distinctive metahistorical peoples \nwho are struggling over the same piece of land that they share an \n“equal” claim to. In contrast, in the scholarly literature, such issues as \nthe political and ideological roots of Zionism are discussed and fought \nout. And whether ‘new historians’ or traditional historians agree or not \nsuch a discussion appears to be connected to a further one \nconcerning the background causes of the conflict’ (Walls 2010, 308).\nThe thesis produces a general conclusion in this regard; \n‘Pointing to my main conclusions, the first of these proceeds from the \ngeneral problem I took as my point of departure in chapter one that \ngenerally speaking the links between scholarship, textbooks and \nteachers’ statements are very weak. In this regard, focusing on the \ntextbooks alone, they do not provide the teachers or pupils with a \nplatform for a broad critical-analytical and balanced understanding of \n103 | P a g e\nthe root causes of the conflict on the basis of varying perspectives’ \n(Walls 2010, 313).\n104 | P a g e\nConclusion of the Chapter:\nThis chapter, the review of the related literature, has listed and introduced all \nexplored research pieces. This review has been conducted to analyse how the \nIsrael/Palestine question has been treated, directly or indirectly, in textbooks \nused in Western educational systems. This has been done with a view to \nmaking a critique of the central points of the research introduced with an \nemphasis on those exercises that are related to design and methodology. This \nconstituted the first part of the chapter. In addition, bias, as a central concern of \nthe research, has been treated thoroughly; an independent category, the \nsecond part of the chapter, has been designed to deal with how the relevant \nresearch takes positions and provides arguments about the bias the writers \nexplore in the textbooks studied.\nThe review produced some outcomes that can contribute to drawing a map of \nthe related literature; it demonstrated that a very limited number of studies have \nbeen conducted to exclusively investigate how Western textbooks treat the \nIsrael/Palestine question; only two pieces of research, those done by Walls and \nAndrea L Smith, can be classified in this category. These studies also \nacknowledged through their literature review that they are the first investigations \nthat have focused on such a topic (in their countries; Sweden and the US \nrespectively) (Walls 2010, 24; A. L. Smith 2011, 40). Other relevant research \nmentioned in this review deals with the question through broader topics such as \n‘Arabs and ‘Middle East’ that can cover the Israel/Palestine question. \nThis review can show as well that all relevant research supports the idea that \ntextbooks used to teach the Israel/Palestine question are biased; all of the \nstudies, except two, support the idea that the prevailing bias is a pro-Israeli one. \nThese two different works are not produced in academia; they are shaped by \nwriters who played a clear role in promoting Israeli interests in the USA; one \nhas acted as president of the Institute for Jewish and Community Research in \nSan Francisco and the other was Executive Director of the American-Israeli \nCooperative Enterprise (AICE). The roles they played might be considered a \nmain factor that can explain their different positions.\n105 | P a g e\nThe anti- Arab/ME bias explored in the Western textbooks is seen in two \ndifferent ways; some, like Van de Ven, view it as a typical American treatment \nof a non-Western country/region. But a bigger number of analysts, mentioned in \nthis review, consider, explicitly or implicitly, this position as a different approach \nthat is at odds with the standard treatment of such questions. \nThe common character of pro-Israeli bias explored in the Western textbooks \nentails presenting the Israeli viewpoint of disputed questions. The Israeli \npositions on these matters are taken for granted and not questioned in a \nscientific critical manner. In contrast, there is a very limited space, if any, for \nproviding students with the Palestinian perspective of the discussed questions. \nThis treatment leaves no chance for students to understand both sides, and \nform a balanced view of the question.\nA number of methods are adopted for conducting textbook analysis in the \nstudies reviewed in this chapter; content analysis, discourse analysis and \ncomparative analysis can be mentioned as the most applied ones. Most pieces \nof research explored in this review are ‘product oriented’ investigations but there \nare cases of ‘reception oriented’ and ‘process oriented’ analyses as well. Both \nquantitative and qualitative methods are used to conduct these pieces of \nresearch. All studies mentioned here are examined by one or two researchers. \nThe only exception is the work done by MESA (Morgan and Walker 2008) that \nused 6 research workers to check the consistency of the judgments made.\nAnother matter of general evaluation of the literature refers to those pieces of \nresearch that have been produced on how Israeli textbooks treat the question. \nThese studies constitute a large part of the existing literature but they have not \nbeen mentioned here as this review is designed to cover only textbooks that are \nused in Western countries.\nAn evaluation of the current state of the literature can also, demonstrate that \nalmost all relevant research explored in this review was conducted by \neducationalists. Educational considerations dominated, as a result, in these \nstudies. This pushed historical and political considerations to the margin. For \ninstance, the political and divisive nature of the Israel/Palestine question, as an \nissue that is located at the heart of an existing, long - lasting, confrontational \n106 | P a g e\nand brutal conflict, and its implications in the research area has been ignored. \nThe afore-mentioned researchers produced and presented their related \nresearch in a way that non - sensitive, non-contentious and neutral topics are \npresented, where readers can easily trust the researchers and their efforts to \nfind substantial answers to their research questions. Here strong political \ntendencies that occupy agents of the research, and provide a limited chance for \nthem to act as an impartial researcher are neglected. Educationalists prefer, in \ngeneral, to pass over such a crucial introduction quickly and jump towards \nevaluations and conclusions that can be translated into useful and practical \nresults for those who are active in teaching and learning. Hence, they don’t \nseem interested in spending time to clarify the methodological and \nepistemological aspects of the research where fundamental assumptions of the \nresearch are formed or main judgments are made. The existence of political \nmotivations increase, rightly, the level of scepticism about the nature of the \njudgments made where such an intense political issue interferes in what \nresearchers produce. Clarification, as a solution to such a problem, can shed \nsome considerable light on what such research suggests, and give a chance to \nreaders who are not ready to rely, only, on the writers’ personal judgment, and \nare eager to make their own judgments. This is possible when a researcher \nshares, with readers, helpful materials s/he has, to make such judgment \npossible; minimizing cases of judgments and maximizing the level of provision \nof evidence and arguments seems like an effective strategy in such a situation. \nStudies reviewed in this chapter, in general, are short on paying serious \nattention to such an issue. As a result, they are under - resourced in providing \nenough material that can make the research clear and repeatable; they are too \nquick and confident, at the same time, in making judgments.\nHence, lack of clarity can form the main flaw explored in the related literature. \nAs mentioned earlier, the special political nature of the question requires the \nutmost clarity as a main way to convince readers about the results of the \nresearch and the way it has been produced. The main body of the explored \nliterature lacks this. The shortcomings belong, at the same time, to different \ncategories; some studies are short in making clear how analysed textbooks are \nselected; many introduce them as the most popular textbooks without \nexplaining how they are ranked as such. Others are short on clarifying the \n107 | P a g e\nmethodological aspect of the research where the reader is not able to realize \nhow this research is conducted or can be repeated. This reduces the chance to \nconvince sceptical readers who see the political aspect of the question as a \nvery effective and powerful factor. \nThis literature review produced other results that introduce a significant gap in \nthe literature and justify conducting this research to fill it:\n• There is a clear gap about textbooks used at college level; no study has \nbeen found that analyses how college textbooks treat the question; the research \nconducted by Al-Bataineh confirms this idea not only for the Israel/Palestine \nquestion but also for all research that is conducted to analyse textbook \ntreatment of the whole Middle East; ‘While these studies are useful to a certain \ndegree, they are limited to elementary and secondary levels. This researcher \ncould not find any content analysis studies that were specifically designed to \nanalyze textbooks used at the college level’ (Al-Bataineh 1998, 21).\n• All empirical research that has been conducted to investigate the nature \nof the questioned treatment, relied on college textbooks as authoritative sources \nof relevant knowledge. Their status as true sources of relevant knowledge is \ntaken for granted. No research went further and questioned the relevant \nknowledge offered in the college textbooks.\n• No research has yet appeared to examine textbook bias on the question \nas a regional (Western) phenomenon that works beyond individual Western \ncountries, and forms a uniform reality that covers all of them. The political and \ninternational role the West plays to support Israel is taken as the real context of \nthe question, and taken as such for the sake of conducting this research,\n• No relevant research has been explored that employs ‘historical \nnarrative’ as a method to analyse textbook treatment of the question. This \nmethod can provide a different chance to focus on the historical property of the \ntextbooks analysed.\nAll these points might contribute to justify why this topic has been chosen and \nhow this can contribute to filling the existing gap in the related literature. There \nare other research projects that can contribute to such an endeavour; all \n108 | P a g e\nempirical investigations that focus on one or more Western country can cover a \nlarger area and help complete the all-inclusive map. As mentioned earlier, what \nwe have now can only cover, partially, the US and Sweden. No research has \nbeen found about the situation in other Western countries.\n109 | P a g e\nChapter 3: \nThe Survey and its Procedure to Establish the Sample\nThis study requires a selection procedure to arrive at a sample, a \nmanageable number of textbooks, for its main examination. The ideal is to \nselect certain textbooks that can represent, better than others, a large number \nof textbook choices that are adopted in Western universities to teach the history \nof the Israel/Palestine question. It is assumed that textbooks that are adopted \nmore frequently should have a higher status of representation. For this it \nappears necessary to find a way to select the most popular/adopted textbooks \nin Western universities. Several strategies can be planned for such an \nendeavour:\n- Publication figures: the figure that displays the number of volumes of a \ngiven published book can refer to ‘the book’s popularity’. This factor works, in \nparticular, when school textbooks are at stake as they are used, predominantly, \nfor schooling purposes. This means one can consider the number of published \ntextbooks as a figure very close to that of those actually used in schools as \ntextbooks. Publishers, in general, are not willing to reveal the information they \nhave in this regard (Wills 1992, 64). Business considerations are one influential \nfactor which makes them very reluctant to do so. But there are places where \nsome information about this matter can be accessed. The American Textbook \nCouncil is one known to many textbook researchers; it provides a list of ‘Widely \nAdopted History Textbooks’ in American schools, which can be consulted easily \nthrough its website (http://historytextbooks.net/adopted.htm). On the subject of \ncollege level textbooks, analysts’ statements suggest that there is not such a \nready list of popular textbooks (Wills 1992, 65). There are other differences as \nwell; Textbooks that are used in colleges can be consulted by a large number of \nother interested readers. This is quite obvious in History if not so in some other \nacademic disciplines.\n- Best sellers: the figures for bestselling books can also say something \nnoticeable about the popularity of a book. But this, again, relates to a wider \nreadership as sales are not limited to college students. One good example of \nsuch a list is the Amazon bestselling list. It is possible to access bestselling \nbooks on the history of Israel at http://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-Books-\n110 | P a g e\nIsrael-History/zgbs/books/5001 for instance. The results of the survey, that \nconducted for the sake of this PhD project to find the most adopted textbooks, \ndemonstrates that there is a meaningful difference between this list (bestselling \nbooks on the history of Israel) and the most used textbooks in colleges.\n- The second - hand online textbook market: there are online companies \nengaged in selling and renting second - hand college textbooks. Valorebooks in \nthe US is one clear instance. Some information provided on its website \n(www.valorebooks.com), the number of used books offered for rent or sale, for \nexample, might indicate the popularity of a book. There is a section on this \nwebsite where the figures for textbooks on Israel can be found \n(http://www.valorebooks.com/new-used-textbooks/history/middle-east/israel). \nAgain here, it is difficult to decide whether or not the figure provides something \nclose to one which can represent the most adopted textbooks. An interest in\nkeeping a useful textbook for probable reference in the future can be one \nreason for not selling a textbook that has been used for the sake of a given \ncourse. Furthermore, these online companies exist only in countries with a huge \nmarket for textbooks such as the US. No similar company has been found in \nother Western countries.\n- The number of editions: the number of editions can probably refer to a \ntextbook’s popularity. At the same time there are popular books that have not \nexperienced several editions. If, for instance, one takes all books on the history \nof Israel with the highest number of editions, 6 or more for example, the list \nproduced cannot necessarily represent all popular textbooks.\n- There are other signs that can say something considerable about the \npopularity of a given book. Citation is one. Databases such as ‘Web of \nKnowledge’ or ‘Google Scholar’ provide figures about how often the book is \ncited in other academic works. The number of reviews in large online book \nstores such as Amazon can give some idea about the popularity of a book as \nwell.\nThe syllabus is the main place where a textbook is introduced formally to \nstudents of a given course. There is no other site to compete with the syllabus \non this matter. A textbook introduced in a syllabus has confirmation of its status \n111 | P a g e\nas an authentic source in a given area of knowledge, granted by an academic \nhierarchy. Books introduced here should best represent the books students \nread to access knowledge in a given course. It is expected that data extracted \nfrom syllabi has the capacity to offer an estimate of adopted textbooks, and \nconfirm which textbooks represent knowledge in a given academic area. The \nproblem with arriving at such a figure is how to collect the relevant data that is \nscattered in a seemingly endless number of colleges, universities, courses and \nclasses. Accessing such information poses a challenge that can be dealt with \nthrough two main strategies:\n1. Communication: through communication, as a medium to reach those \nwho have access to syllabi data, lecturers of the related courses and also \nothers in the university departments or libraries could be contacted. \nCommunication is easier these days thanks to the provision of email \naddresses of college staff through university websites. Phone calls and \nordinary letters were the main alternatives before the days of the internet. \nIn any case, in using modern or traditional ways of communication, there \nare obstacles that might limit the results of this survey due to certain \nfactors that might work against ideal achievements:\n University lecturers are busy people; allocating enough time to \nprovide information for a student in another university/country \nmight not form a priority for them,\n The addressees might choose some, and not other, syllabi to \nsend when encountered with a question about readings they \nsuggest to students, for some professional or political reasons,\n Due to the controversial nature of the subject and its strong \npolitical dimension, lecturers might not feel comfortable if asked \nabout provision of such information,\n Communication with a large number of lecturers, hundreds for \ninstance, requires a sizeable amount of time and labour that might \nnot easily be available for a PhD student,\n112 | P a g e\n2. Web content mining: as a significant number of universities in the West \nhave started to provide online syllabi, a search engine can help as an \neffective tool to extract required syllabi from online sources. This strategy \nmight have a better chance of success if the negative factors of the last \nstrategy (communication) are taken into consideration.\nProliferation of online college syllabi provides a valuable source of information \nabout the ‘scholarly impact’ of different academic readings in general, and \ntextbooks in particular. This has been confirmed through some empirical \ninvestigations, including the one conducted by Kayvan Kousha and Mike \nThelwall in their article ‘Assessing the Impact of Disciplinary Research on \nTeaching: An Automatic Analysis of Online Syllabuses’ (Kousha and Thelwall \n2008). This study supports the idea that online syllabi provide enough data for \nevaluating journal articles in some social sciences including political science, \nsuggesting it as a new source of ‘scholarly impact’ besides ‘journal citation’.\nThere is academic research now that has been conducted using this new \nsource of data; ‘By the Book: Assessing the Place of Textbooks in U. S. Survey \nCourses’ is one study that uses online syllabi to find the most adopted \ntextbooks in US colleges for teaching US history, in order to evaluate the place \nof textbooks in academic courses (Cohen 2005). The emergence of online \nsyllabi as valuable data encouraged researchers to find more effective \ntechniques to extract the required syllabi from online sources. ‘The Syllabus \nBased Web Content Extractor’ an article by Saba Hilal and S. A. M. Rizvi is one \npiece of work that suggests a technique to make web syllabus mining easier \n(Hilal, Rizvi, and Islamia 2008). This, also, encouraged creating databases that \nstore a large number of syllabi. The ‘Syllabus Finder’ is considered a main \nsource that has collected over a million syllabi between 2002 and 2009. This \nonline database that is characterized as the largest fund of syllabi ever, \naccording to its founder, has been abandoned, however, due to new regulations \nthat now govern searching on Google.\n113 | P a g e\nOverall Boundaries of the Survey:\nGeneral guidelines/limits are needed to locate the selection procedure in an \nexact area that most suits the objectives of the search. Textbooks that are used \nin Western universities to teach the history of the Israel/Palestine question are \nthe main target of the search. The following guidelines are designed to focus \nthe search on this exact area:\n Place: all universities that are based in Western countries and can be \nconsidered part of Western academia are included in this search in \ngeneral. The West, or Western countries, is taken as a political concept \nthat is used commonly in a wide range of literature and includes most \nEuropean countries and those countries outside Europe where a majority \nof its population have European origins i.e. the United States, Canada, \nAustralia and New Zealand. There is a language obstacle if all these \nEuropean countries are taken for textbook analysis, as they speak too \nmany different languages which would require books in different \nlanguages. Only one language, English, is taken for this analysis as it \ncovers a large part of knowledge production about the subject in the \nWest where the US, the UK and Canada are taken into account. Other \nEnglish - speaking countries of the West, such as Ireland, Australia and \nNew Zealand are also included in this survey. There are Western \nuniversities that are based in non-Western countries. These cases are \nnot included due to the fact that their different environment might impact \non their textbook choices. The American University in Cairo is one case \nwhere its online syllabi are excluded on this basis.\n Time: the research aims to deal with the contemporary West. As a result \nit was necessary to put a time limit in the near past to frame a period of \ntime between then and now that can be considered as contemporary \ntime. The year 2000 has been chosen for this purpose; all courses that \nare offered in 2000 or later are included in the selection search. In \npractice the search conducted for this survey shows that few online \nsyllabi come from a time before that date.\n Reading Materials: different kinds of reading materials are introduced in \ncollege syllabi. This includes books, journal articles, documents, films \nand so on. For the sake of this research only related books are recorded. \n114 | P a g e\nMany books about Israel or the history of the question have been \nidentified while searching online sources. This search excludes all books \nexcept those that cover the history of the question in general. Hence \nbooks that deal only with some historical events such as wars or the \nhistory of Palestine alone, and not Israel, are not selected. The books \nchosen through the search are the ones that constitute a survey of the \nquestion’s history.\n Courses: the main target was courses that deal with the history of Israel \nor the Arab-Israeli conflict. But other courses such as those on the \nMiddle East or Israel are recorded as well. There are other courses, with \nno direct relation to the question, that have been used as a source of \nrequired data; courses on ‘world history’, ‘peace and conflict’ or \n‘international relations’ can be mentioned in this regard. The reason for \nincluding them is that they deal with the history of Israel, if only as a \nminor section of the syllabus. The main courses that have been removed \nfrom the search even though they contained some related data were \nthose that introduced relevant textbooks in a completely different context. \nSometimes a syllabus introduces one book just as a general example \nregardless of its topic. This was a main case that has not been included \nin the collected data.\n‘Syllabus finder’ could work as an ideal place to find syllabi that contain \nrequired textbooks but its closure deprived researchers of that chance. There \nare other syllabi funds that are provided online. A small number of academic \nestablishments provide a remarkable number of syllabi in a given discipline. The \nAmerican Academy of Religion and the American Political Science Association \nare good instances. Some publishing companies have also established \ndatabases that contain information about adopted textbooks. One in the UK, \nBlackwell's, was successful in building a sizeable database but the data \nprovided is limited and includes only books that they have to sell. No syllabus \ndatabase was found that suffices for a thorough search. Websites of university \ndepartments can be visited to find course syllabi. There are extensive lists of \nsyllabi for Jewish Studies in the UK and US and some other Western countries \nthat can be used for such a purpose but many university websites do not have a \nclear policy on the provision of all syllabi online. The MIT website, \n115 | P a g e\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu/courses/, is an exception where all syllabi of the courses \noffered in the university can be accessed online. ‘Jewish virtual libraries’ was \nthe only source found that had a good number of syllabi for courses on Israel. A \nnumber of syllabi referenced in this survey of American and Canadian \nuniversities come from this database. Alternatively this study conducted an \nextensive search on Google to find required data in different Western countries. \nSearches started with the United Kingdom and moved to other countries when \nthe search in one country was exhausted. The last part of a web address, such \nas ‘ie’ or ‘nz’, that identifies the country is used to manage such a search. In \nsome cases domains that are used only for academic institutions, such as ac.uk \nfor instance, are used to search university websites in a given country. At the \nfirst stage searches are focused on related syllabi and when an extensive list of \nused textbooks is formed, textbooks’ titles or authors’ names can become a \nmain keyword for the search. Some general keywords such as syllabus, course \noutline, Israel, history, reading list, course code, bibliography, credit, semester, \nassessment and module proved useful in extracting online syllabi. Facilities \nprovided by advanced search on Google were also quite helpful. ‘File type’ was \na big help as most of the syllabi found are in pdf format. Others are mainly \nMicrosoft word documents (doc). Some cases of other files like html are also \nexplored. All extracted syllabi have been scanned thoroughly with an aim to \nfinding books that deal with the history of the question. All cases of such books \nare recorded in an independent file for further processing when calculations \nshould be done to determine the most adopted books. Other strategies that \nhelped managing the search are presented as follows:\n Some syllabi are found more than once in different searches. Only one \nsyllabus is taken for calculation if there was more than one copy on the \ninternet. With all measures to avoid such problems in place, a final check \nto find duplication proved necessary. Also if there was more than one \nreference to a book on one syllabus, later references were disregarded.\n Books, sometimes, are referred to through different editions. This \ndifference is ignored while searching, and the last edition is taken for \nanalysis as it can represent, more than older editions, the contemporary \ncondition of the book,\n116 | P a g e\n If similar or the same syllabi for one course appear that belong to \ndifferent academic years/semesters, all of them are taken into account. \nThis has been done due to the fact that different times can refer to \ndifferent instances of textbook adoption.\n Some syllabi refer students to an address on the university Intranet, \nBlackboard for instance, or hand-outs that are distributed in the class for \nreading lists. If there is no online reading list at all the syllabus is \nremoved from the search. The extracted syllabus is recorded when the \nwhole reading list or part of it is presented online,\n Books mentioned for reading on syllabi are introduced through different \ncategories; some are clearly introduced as textbooks for a course. There \nare other categories under which books are introduced; ‘Required \nTexts/Reading/Textbook’, ‘Principal/Core Texts’, ‘Mandatory Textbook’, \n‘Suggested/Preliminary Readings’, ‘Reading Materials’ and ‘Bibliography’ \nare the main ones. The number of books introduced for reading on a \nsyllabus varies greatly. One book only is introduced in some cases, and \nin other cases the number might go very high, to constitute tens of \nbooks. Sometimes books are introduced as a source for the whole \ncourse, and sometimes as a source for one part/session of the course. \nAll these complexities are discounted when lists of extracted books are \nformed; a book is recorded if there was a recommendation, of any \ncategory, to read the book for the sake of the course.\n Some readings are introduced sometimes without mentioning the book \ntitle, mentioning a writer for instance. These general recommendations \n(to read writings of a given writer) are also ignored for the sake of \nsimplicity.\n Books that have been written by my primary supervisor, Professor Ilan \nPappe, are removed from the search. This has been done due to the fact \nthat analysing books written by one’s supervisor might not form a proper \nsubject for impartial and unbiased investigation. Pappe’s writings about \nthe question in general, and ‘The Israel/Palestine Question’, ‘A History of \nModern Palestine: One Land, Two Peoples’ and ‘The Making of the \nArab-Israeli Conflict’ in particular, are recommended by many syllabi but \n117 | P a g e\nit is not believed that these books can reach the top adopted textbooks \nthat have been selected for this analysis.\n There were a few cases of a syllabus with a potential to be counted in \nthis search but reaching them proved impossible; a message ‘page not \nfound’ was received every time an enquiry was tried.\n It is quite likely that a few cases of a required syllabus are not found due \nto mistakes that might have occurred in spelling the title of the book or its \nauthor in online syllabi; some cases of misspelled titles are explored \nthrough other keywords in fact.\n All syllabi that were used for this survey come from open online sources. \nNo attempt, whatsoever, has been made to extract or publish syllabi that \nare designed for the sole use of a certain community,\n Due to the fact that the English language is used in some non-English -\nspeaking Western countries such as The Netherlands, Sweden, \nSwitzerland, Finland, Denmark and Norway to teach academic \ndisciplines, a good number of online syllabi from those countries might \nexist to form a sizeable quantity of data for determining the most adopted \ntextbooks of the field in those countries. In addition, there are courses in \nthese countries that are not taught in English but their syllabus has a \nreference to English books as reading material. Conducting such a \nsearch might add something to the results of this survey that is based \nonly on results from 6 countries in the West. It is believed that there \nwould be a better chance for such extension in years to come as the \nnumbers of on line syllabi are increasing.\nThe Results of the Survey:\nThe main results of the survey are presented in this section where 10 \ntables are designed; the first table lists all extracted textbooks with their \nadoption frequencies in all the countries studied. The second one lists, in \norder, the textbooks with higher frequencies, to display the top adopted \ntextbooks, and the third one shows all book frequencies in all countries of \nthe survey. Table 4 exhibits the position of the (6) selected textbooks in all \ncountries of the survey. Six other tables (table 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12) are designed \nto record all extracted syllabi in six countries of the survey. Table 12, the \n118 | P a g e\nlongest one, is presented in the appendix. There are some general points \nabout the results of the search that come in advance as follows:\n The search operation conducted for this survey resulted in the \nextraction of 496 syllabi: 370 syllabi from USA universities, 49 syllabi \nfrom British universities, 42 syllabi from Canadian universities, 16 \nsyllabi from Australian universities, 11 syllabi from New Zealand \nuniversities and 8 syllabi from Irish universities.\n The position of the six selected textbooks at the top of the list of all \nadopted textbooks in all six countries of the survey (Table 4) supports\nthe idea that one pattern of textbook adoption (on the history of the \nIsrael/Palestine question) governs all six countries of the survey. This \nfinding also proposes that this pattern might govern other Western \ncountries, and the West as a whole.\n There are a few textbooks, six indeed, which have much higher \nfrequencies compared with other textbooks that are recommended \nthrough syllabi. The big gap between their frequencies and those \nbelonging to other textbooks narrows any chance of a radical change \nin the list of the top 6 textbooks if further searches are conducted. \nThis gives more credit to the top-six list to truly represent the most \nadopted textbooks.\n Search results in larger countries, the US, the UK and Canada, which \nproduce more online syllabi, could be regarded as more reliable \ncompared with those belonging to smaller countries (Ireland, New \nZealand) that are established on fewer cases of extracted syllabi.\n The extracted textbooks originate from different courses; some of \nthem are designed to teach the history of the Israel/Palestine \nquestion or a much related subject. Others are focused on different \nsubjects such as those related to the Middle East or world History. A \ntextbook adoption is registered in the survey when the book is \nmentioned as a source of relevant knowledge on Israel/Palestine \nquestion.\n The textbooks chosen are adopted differently in different syllabi; \nsome of them have been introduced as the main textbook for the \nrelated courses; ‘Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict’, ‘A History of \n119 | P a g e\nIsrael’, ‘A History of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict’ and ‘A Concise \nHistory of the Arab-Israeli Conflict’ are introduced as such in many \nsyllabi. Some others, ‘Righteous Victims’ for instance, haven’t been \nregarded as in this category in most cases.\n There are other indications that confirm the findings of the survey; \none can be seen in a popular textbook ‘A Concise History of the \nArab-Israeli Conflict’ where almost all books that are ‘suggested’ for \n‘Further Reading’ on the history of Israel are the same textbooks that \nhave been explored as ‘the most adopted textbooks’ in the survey \n(Bickerton and Klausner 1998, Introduction).\n The list of twenty frequently adopted textbooks on the history of the \nIsrael/Palestine question, shown in Table 1, demonstrates that none \nof them are written by a Palestinian, Arab or Muslim. This survey \nsuggests Professor Ilan Pappe as the only scholar, with a critical view \nof Zionism, who has a chance of being included in the list of the top \ntwenty writers of the most adopted textbooks in Western countries, \nwhich features in the survey.\n120 | P a g e\nTable 1: Frequencies of textbook adoptions on all extracted syllabi3\nNo Author Textbook Title Year Countries of the Survey\nUK IE CA NZ AU US\n1 Gelvin, J.L., The Israel-Palestine Conflict: \nOne Hundred Years of War\n2007 8 1 2 4 28\n2 Smith, C.D., Palestine and the Arab\u0002Israeli Conflict: A History with \nDocuments\n2009 16 3 17 4 6 97\n3 Shindler, C., A History of Modern Israel 2008 5 3 20\n4 Sachar,H.M History of Israel: From the \nRise of Zionism to Our Time\n1996 10 1 6 4 66\n5 Morris, B., Righteous Victims: A History \nof the Zionist-Arab Conflict, \n1881-1999\n1999 18 4 15 2 2 82\n6 Tessler, Mark A History of the Israeli\u0002Palestinian Conflict1994 19 13 61\n7 Beilin, Yossi Israel: A Concise Political \nHistory\n1992 4\n8 Gilbert, Martin Israel: A History 1998 7 1\n9 O’Brien, Conor \nCruise,\nThe Siege: The Story of \nIsrael and Zionism\n1986 4\n10 Schulze,\nKirsten E. \nThe Arab-Israeli Conflict 1999 6 1\n11 Dowty, Alan Israel/Palestine 2008 3 4 29\n12 Lochery, Neill A Short History of Israel 2001 1\n13 Fraser, T.

This examination, as mentioned earlier, is focused on ‘pro\u0002Israeli’ bias as a possible factor that might regulate how that history is narrated \nin these books. Before reporting the results of an actual analysis of those \ntextbooks, an introduction on Zionist/pro-Israeli historiography is offered to \nexplain how such bias is recognized in this study.\nZionist Historiography (of ‘History of Israel’):\nHistory of ‘Israel’, as a polity we know now, only actually started from a very \nrecent time - when Zionism arose in Europe on the eve of the twentieth century. \nAncient history of the land, however, plays a crucial role in how that history is \nbeing narrated by Zionist historiography, and written. The controversial nature \nof the Zionist claim to the land, and widespread rejection of this claim \ncontributed to such a state of affairs. The period nominated as the Ancient Time \nis taken, by Zionist historiographers, as a main source to produce arguments \nthat might support the legitimacy of the Zionist claim to the land. This enterprise \nhas been directed by a critical need to justify occupying a land thousands of \nkilometres away from where the first Zionist Jews lived in Europe, and one \nwhich was populated, already, by other people. This was not possible without a \nlong journey of thousands of years back in history, to a time when a ‘Jewish \nstate’ can be imagined. From here the Zionist historiography came to function \nas a main producer of ‘history’ about the Jewish presence in the land, to \ndemonstrate ‘the right of Jews’ to establish a ‘Jewish state’ in Palestine. As a \nresult, a Zionist history of Israel has been produced that can establish a link \nbetween Israel and the history of the disputed land. The main elements of this \nhistory can be outlined as follows:\n ‘The Holy Land’ was the birthplace of the ‘Jewish people’, where their \n‘national identity’ was formed.\n In this land ‘Jewish people’ established their own statehood. Zion \n(Jerusalem) is introduced as the centre of this ancient ‘Jewish state’.\n139 | P a g e\n Palestine was populated by ‘Jewish people’ before a forced expulsion by \nRomans that drove them out.\n There is a Jewish ethnos: All Jews in different corners of the world are \ndescended from the same ancestors, those who were expelled from \nPalestine.\n Wherever they settled outside Palestine, after the ‘expulsion’, they kept \nthe hope to return to ‘their land’, and establish their ‘national home’ and \nstrove to achieve their dream.\nThese elements can be seen, explicitly or implicitly, in different types of Zionist \nhistories of the land, and are the same elements that are placed in ‘Israel’s \nDeclaration of Independence’ to justify the Zionist endeavour in Palestine: \n‘The Land of Israel was the birthplace of the Jewish people. Here \ntheir spiritual, religious and national identity was formed. Here they \nachieved independence and created a culture of national and \nuniversal significance. Here they wrote and gave the Bible to the \nworld. Exiled from the Land of Israel the Jewish people remained \nfaithful to it in all the countries of their dispersion, never ceasing to \npray and hope for their return and the restoration of their national \nfreedom. Impelled by this historic association, Jews strove \nthroughout the centuries to go back to the land of their fathers and \nregain their statehood’(Laqeuer and Rubin 2008, 81).\nAccompanying the establishment of this mega narrative about the land’s \n‘Jewishness’ there are two relevant lines of historiography that function to \ncomplete that narrative but in two different ways: the first one undermines any \nmajor Jewish collective experience in other lands except those that function as \na reminder of the Jewish dispersion. In this way thousands of years of the \npresence of Jewish communities in other lands, Iran and Iraq for instance, are\ndiscounted. Jewish achievements in establishing states, the Himyarite kingdom \nand the kingdom of Adiabene, for instance, and even an empire, the Khazarian \nEmpire, outside the Holy Land are seen as outside the main frame of Jewish \nhistorical experience. There are reports, from Israel, about how the Israeli \neducational system treats such cases; ‘Thus the chapter about the Judaizing \nHimyarites was abandoned by the historiographical roadside in Israel's \n140 | P a g e\neducational system, and secondary school graduates know nothing about it. It is \nthe sad fate of this mighty Jewish kingdom, which dominated its region, that its \ndescendants are not proud of it and that many others fear to mention its very \nexistence’(Shlomo Sand 2009, 199). It is added in the same report that this \ntreatment, of the Himyarite case, is not an exception but the norm; other Jewish \ndomains outside Palestine, in North Africa and near the Caspian Sea, are \nsimilarly suppressed: ‘From 1951 to the present moment, not a single historical \nwork about the Khazars has appeared in Hebrew. …. The Israeli academic \nworld has been mute on this topic, and no significant research has taken \nplace.(Shlomo Sand 2009, 235–6)’ \nIn a different but related historiographical line, all which has been experienced \nin the history of the Holy Land after the Jews’ supposed expulsion is \noverlooked. As a result there is a powerful tendency in Zionist historiography to \nignore the Arab history of the land; all that happened in this long period of time, \nalmost 2000 years, is considered as something temporary, minor, foreign or \nirrelevant. It is not difficult to see how these (two) complementary lines of \nhistoriography can contribute to forming a single picture of the land as a place \noriginally belonging to the Jews who were deprived, at one stage, of being \npresent in it, but managed later to regain their right to the home land.\nThis story of the land is not necessarily factual, representing what really \nhappened. It is constructed at a certain historical stage when the Zionist \nmovement needed to justify its claim to the land. This point has been articulated \nby a number of historians, including Israeli historian Shlomo Sand. Sand’s \nideas, in this regard, are taken in this study for their capacity to reveal the \nmythical aspect of Zionist history, ‘mythistory’ according to him. He clarifies, in \nhis recent works, how the Zionist history has no precedent in the pre-Zionist era \nof Jewish history, and was invented later by Jewish nationalists in Europe in the \nnineteenth and twentieth century; \n‘At a certain stage in the 19th century intellectuals of Jewish origin in \nGermany, influenced by the folk character of German nationalism, \ntook upon themselves the task of inventing a people \n\"retrospectively,\" out of a thirst to create a modern Jewish people. \nFrom historian Heinrich Graetz on, Jewish historians began to draw \n141 | P a g e\nthe history of Judaism as the history of a nation that had been a \nkingdom, became a wandering people and ultimately turned around \nand went back to its birthplace’(Shlomo Sand 2008).\nThe Zionist meta narrative is criticised by a number of scholars who have \ncontributed to the formation of a critical literature on the subject. Recently, \nShlomo Sand summarized this critique, mainly through his book, The Invention \nof the Jewish People. This summary can highlight the possible problems with \nthis meta narrative; the first case is related to the ancient time when a ‘united \nJewish kingdom’ under David and Solomon was established; ‘The central myths \nabout the primeval origin of a marvelous nation that emerged from the desert, \nconquered a spacious land and built a glorious kingdom were a boon for rising \nJewish nationalism and Zionist colonization. For a century they provided textual \nfuel of canonical quality that energized a complex politics of identity and \nterritorial expansion demanding self-justification and considerable \nsacrifice’(Shlomo Sand 2009, 122). Sand brings up the new archaeological \ndiscoveries to reveal how the myths of a united Jewish kingdom and ancient \nJewish state are advanced for ideological and political reasons. He refers to the \nfact that no ‘trace or memory’ has been found of the ‘glorious kingdoms of David \nand Solomon’. The significance of this development is reflected in Sand’s own \nwords:\n‘The next biblical story to lose its scientific historicity as a result of \nnew archaeological discoveries was the jewel in the crown of the \nlong national memory. Ever since Graetz, through Dinur and the \nIsraeli historians who followed, the united national kingdom of David \nand Solomon was the glorious golden age in Jewish history… It was \nnot possible to dig under the Haram al-Sharif, but explorations at all \nthe other sites that were opened up around it failed to find any traces \nof an important tenth-century kingdom, the presumed time of David \nand Solomon. No vestige was ever found of monumental structures, \nwalls or grand palaces, and the pottery found there was scanty and \nquite simple’(Shlomo Sand 2009, 120).\nSand concludes that these archaeological discoveries do not allow for the \nrecognition of a political entity bigger than a ‘small tribal kingdom’ at the time of \n142 | P a g e\nthe presumed Jewish kingdom, if such an entity ever existed (Shlomo Sand \n2009, 121). He offers a general conclusion on the united Jewish kingdom that is \nsupported, according to him, by most recent archaeologists: ‘The conclusion \naccepted by a majority of the new archaeologists and Bible scholars was that \nthere never was a great united monarchy and that King Solomon never had \ngrand palaces in which he housed his 700 wives and 300 concubines. The fact \nthat the Bible does not name this large empire strengthens this conclusion. It \nwas later writers who invented and glorified a mighty united kingdom, \nestablished by the grace of the single deity’(Shlomo Sand 2009, 122).\nIn relation to another Zionist historiographical construction, Jewish expulsion \nfrom the Holy Land when conquered by the Romans, Sand argues that no \nhistorical document of what the Romans did in the Holy Land supports a mass \nexpulsion of Jews; ‘Nowhere in the abundant Roman documentation is there \nany mention of a deportation from Judea. Nor have any traces been found of \nlarge refugee populations around the borders of Judea after the uprising, as \nthere would have been if a mass flight had taken place’(Shlomo Sand 2009, \n131). He puts this case in a wider context of how Romans treated others in the \nregion; this allows an affirmative conclusion: ‘the Romans never exiled any \nnation from anywhere on the eastern seaboard of the Mediterranean’(Schlomo \nSand 2008). Sand argues, further, that the Romans did not possess the \nnecessary means for such large scale dispossession of a big population even if \nthey had been willing to undertake such an enterprise: \n‘Roman rulers could be utterly ruthless in suppressing rebellious \nsubject populations: they executed fighters, took captives and sold \nthem into slavery, and sometimes exiled kings and princes. But they \ndefinitely did not deport whole populations in the countries they \nconquered in the East, nor did they have the means to do so-none of \nthe trucks, trains or great ships available in the modern \nworld’(Shlomo Sand 2009, 130).\nA Christian myth is processed, according to Sand, to construct the story of \nexile; this Christian myth is used to explain the disappearance of Jews from the \nHoly Land, through a religious tradition that relates it to a punishment by God \nfor committing a grave crime, killing the Christ (Shlomo Sand 2009, 134). He \n143 | P a g e\nelaborates how this Christian tradition, once it was incorporated in the Jewish \ntradition, could be taken as a useful account that could make a link between \nJews in other places, Europe for instance, and Palestine (Shlomo Sand 2009, \n134). This influential invention succeeded in becoming a dominant historical \naccount in the West, and was exhibited as an historical fact. ‘The Arab-Israeli \nConflict (Oxford History for GCSE), possibly the most adopted textbook in the \nBritish educational system on the subject, can be mentioned as an instance \nwhere this Zionist construction is introduced as a fact; ‘The Jews were driven \nout of Palestine by the Romans after two revolts in AD 70 and AD 135’(T. Rea \nand Wright 1997, 4). Sand emphasises the extraordinary Zionist success in \nestablishing this narrative with no evidence to support it as a true history of the \nancient Jews: \n‘The myth that recounted the expulsion of the “Jewish people” by the \nRomans became the supreme justification for claiming historical \nrights over a Palestine that Zionist rhetoric transformed into the “land \nof Israel.” We have here a particularly astonishing example of the \nmolding of a collective memory. Thus, even though all specialists in \nancient Jewish history know that the Romans did not deport the \npopulation of Judea (there is not even the slightest work of historical \nresearch on this subject), other, less qualified individuals have been, \nand largely remain, convinced that the ancient “People of Israel” \nwere forcibly uprooted from their homeland, as is solemnly stated in \nthe Declaration of Independence of the State of Israel’(Shlomo Sand \n2009, 317). \nSand also deals with why such invention took place. Without that, he argues, \nthe Zionist claim to Palestine was incomplete: ‘The ultra-paradigm of \ndeportation was essential for the construction of a long - term memory wherein \nan imaginary, exiled people-race could be described as the direct descendants \nof the former “people of the Bible” (Shlomo Sand 2009, 130). The invention of \nexile, according to him, was a necessary construction for justifying the Zionist \nclaim of the people without a land to the land without a people; \n‘National mythology determined that the Jews - banished, deported \nor fugitive emigrants - were driven into a long and dolorous exile, \n144 | P a g e\ncausing them to wander over lands and seas to the far corners of the \nearth until the advent of Zionism prompted them to turn around and \nreturn en masse to their orphaned homeland. This homeland had \nnever belonged to the Arab conquerors, hence the claim of the \npeople without a land to the land without a people’ (Shlomo Sand \n2009, 188).\nSand refers to the ‘Jewish people’, and the ‘Jewish nation’ in its modern sense, \nas another case of Zionist historiographical invention that took place to \ncomplete the claim’s justification; ‘Only this myth of Hebrew ancestors could \njustify the right that they claimed over Palestine. Many people are still convinced \nof this today. Everyone knows that, in the modern world, membership of a \nreligious community does not provide ownership rights to a territory whereas an \n“ethnic” people always have a land they can claim as their ancestral heritage’ \n(Shlomo Sand 2010, 316). He elaborates how Jews before this invention saw \nthemselves as people who shared a religious belief and not a common ethnic \nbackground. He argues, subsequently, that there was not such a thing as a \nJewish people in history: ‘With the exception of Eastern Europe, where the \ndemographic weight and uniquely distinctive structure of Jewish life nurtured a \nspecific form of popular culture and vernacular language, no Jewish people—as \na single, cohesive entity—ever appeared’ (Shlomo Sand 2010, 322). He names\na volume by Heinrich Graetz, ‘History of the Jews from the Oldest Times to the \nPresent’, published in the 1850s, as a pioneering work in that invention (Shlomo \nSand 2009, 73). The story of expulsion from the land, and also ‘the myth of ‘the \nJewish ethnos’ is manipulated to construct a Jewish people. It is argued in this \nZionist narrative that Jews who were expelled from the land did not try to \nconvert other people to Judaism, so that all the Jews who live in other lands are \nreal descendants of the Jews who were forced to leave Palestine. Sand rejects \nthis claim and mentions a number of major cases in history where the Jews \nsucceeded in mass conversion of other people; Arabs in Arabia, Berbers in \nNorth Africa and Khazars in Europe for instance (Shlomo Sand 2009, chap. 4). \nHe puts a notable emphasis on the Khazarian Empire that was converted to \nJudaism in the 8th century. The importance of this, for him, lies in the fact that \nKhazar descendants are the Jews who spread later into the eastern and central \nEuropean countries, and formed major Jewish populations in these areas. He \n145 | P a g e\nrefers to the fascinating irony that these Jews, known now as Ashkenazi Jews, \nare those who started the call for a return to the ancestral land in Zion, and \nconstituted the main part of Jewish immigrants in early Israel, and still form the \nmain part of the population and power in this country (Shlomo Sand 2009, chap. \n4).\nSand also deconstructs the Zionist myth of Jewish redemptionist efforts to \nreturn to the homeland where Zionist historians insist on the idea that there \nhave been continuous Jewish efforts to return to the Holy Land, introducing the \nZionist movement as the last, and the only successful, one that accomplished \nthe long - tried project:\n‘Over the centuries, Jews ardently longed for Zion, their holy city, but \nit never occurred to them, not even to those living close by, to go and \nsettle there in their earthly life. It is certainly hard to live at the heart \nof a holy place, all the more so when the small minority who did live \nthere were well aware how they continued to live in exile: only the \ncoming of the Messiah would allow them to reach the metaphysical \nJerusalem—along with all the dead, we should not forget’ (Shlomo \nSand 2010, 317).\nHe explained later in this statement that this longing had no national or physical \nmeaning; but it was a religious mythology based on waiting for the coming of \nthe saviour, the Messiah, in Zion where all the dead would rise to join the event. \nTo support this idea he further refers to the chances provided in some historical \nperiods for Jews in the ‘diaspora’ to return but no interest was shown by them \nfor such a Zionist enterprise. Babylonia is mentioned as the first instance; \n‘Therefore, when the Jewish cultural centers in Babylonia declined, the Jews \nmigrated to Baghdad, not to Jerusalem, although both cities were ruled by the \nsame caliphate’ (Shlomo Sand 2009, 136). Another main chance became \navailable when the Jews were expelled from Spain: ‘The Jewish deportees from \nSpain migrated to cities all around the Mediterranean, but only a few chose to \ngo to Zion. In the modern age, with its ferocious pogroms and the rise of \naggressive nationalism in Eastern Europe, masses of the Yiddish people \nmigrated Westward, mainly to the United States’ (Shlomo Sand 2009, 136). The \nmigration to Palestine, according to him, found momentum only when the \n146 | P a g e\nAmerican borders became closed to Jews: ‘Only when the American borders \nclosed in the 1920s, and again after the horrendous Nazi massacres, did \nsignificant numbers migrate to Mandatory Palestine, part of which became the \nState of Israel’ (Shlomo Sand 2009, 136). Sand concludes in this regard: ‘The \nJews were not forcibly deported from their \"homeland,\" and there was no \nvoluntary \"return\" to it’ (Shlomo Sand 2009, 136). \nDeconstruction of the Zionist history of the pre-Zionist era, by Sand and other \nhistorians, has contributed to providing some additional points which can be \nsummarised as follows:\n The Old Testament is the main source for the Zionist history of ancient \ntimes. There is no legitimate ground for considering this book of religious \nJewish tradition as a reliable source of historical facts. Sand elaborates \nhow some secular historians, Zionists, take a different approach to the \nreligious tradition, in this case, and why:\n‘This is why, in the eyes of the first Zionist historians, the Bible \nceased to be an impressive theological text and became a book of \nsecular history, whose teaching is still dispensed to all Jewish Israeli \npupils in specially designated lessons, from the first year of \nelementary school to graduation from high school. According to this \nteaching, the people of Israel were no longer made up of those \nchosen by God, but became a nation issuing from the seed of \nAbraham. And so when modern archaeology began to show that \nthere had not been an Exodus from Egypt, and that the great, unified \nmonarchy of David and Solomon never existed, it met with a bitter \nand embarrassed reaction from the secular Israeli public; some \npeople did not even flinch from accusing the “new archaeologists” of \n“Bible denial” (Shlomo Sand 2010, 316).\n Other relevant historical evidence, archaeological or textual, does not \nhave the power to support the Zionist history of ancient times as factual; \nit may in fact be seen to reject it.\n A high percentage of what is represented in Zionist history as ‘historical \nfacts’ has no chance, whatsoever, of being established as such due to \ntwo main reasons; many of the events recorded occurred a very long \n147 | P a g e\ntime ago, thousands of years in the past, for instance, and this makes \nthem too remote, from the viewpoint of historical investigation, to be \nverified as historically accurate. They are, in fact, close to the pre \nhistorical era, seen from this perspective. The second reason refers to a \nsubstantial shortage of written reports that have survived from that time.\n Without any doubt, it is an historical fact that Arabs were populating the \nland when Zionist settlers came in. This Arab settlement can be seen, \nthrough a wealth of evidence and documents, not only for that time but \nalso for the majority of the land’s ‘certain history’ (a history that is \ndocumented by enough reliable proofs) if not all.\nThe Zionist Narratio:\nHistorical works, including history textbooks, are deconstructed through different \ncritical methods. Historical narrative analysis, as a novel approach to examining \nhistory, focuses on the textbook (or any other history) as a whole rather than on \nits parts. The stress, in this analysis, has moved away from portrayal of distinct \nhistorical ‘facts’ to how the whole history is presented, or how the mega story is \nstructured. It engages with the central structure of the narrative which is called \n‘narratio’ in the relevant literature. It is argued that the meaning of the ‘facts’ \nproduced in a certain history is dependent on the process of placing as it \nfunctions in the narratio. The rhetoric is considered ineffective if not reinforced \nby a structure to support it. It is revealed that such structure comes from the \nmain ideological positions that historians take towards the history. There is an \nemphasis, in this methodology, on the role historians play in constructing \nhistorical knowledge. This analysis is influenced by an observation that \npromotes a shift from ‘great stories’ to ‘great story tellers’ (Vanhulle 2009). \nAnother shift advocated in this analysis is from focusing on rhetoric and wording \nto something deeper that underlies the whole history but is not stated as such. \nWhat lies here, the structure, can convey the main message of the constructed \nhistory, and refer to the main reason a certain history is written (Vanhulle 2009). \nThere are few cases of examining history textbooks by means of this method \ni.e. historical narrative analysis; ‘The Path of History: Narrative Analysis of \nHistory Textbooks’ is one instance. This study is conducted to analyse Belgian \n148 | P a g e\nhistory textbooks from the period 1945-2004. The research identified different \nnarratios that dominated successively the Belgian secondary school history \ntextbooks at different times after 1945; ‘the liberal narratio’, ‘the evolution \nnarratio’ and ‘the cyclical narratio’ are suggested, in this study, as the main \nones. The research argues that it is the narratio, a liberal one for instance, that \ndetermines the meaning constructed in the history provided in the textbook. In \nthis case, the liberal narratio, presents history as moving towards the \nperfection/victory of democracy and liberal values. This narratio is influenced \nheavily, according to this study, by liberal ideology; ‘What we find in the liberal \nnarratio is an almost exact copy of the historical visions and beliefs of \nnineteenth-century liberalism; this ideology is not explicitly pronounced but it \nreveals itself through the narrative structure’ (Vanhulle 2009).\nAn observation of the Zionist historiography of the Israel/Palestine question of \nthe pre-Zionist era, discussed earlier in this chapter, can offer a functioning \nnarratio, named the ‘Zionist narratio’ in this research. This narratio structures \nthe relevant history in a way that supports the Zionists’ claim to the land. The \ngeneral targets of this historical narratio can be summarised as follows:\n• Proving the historical Jewishness of the land\n• Overlooking other historical choices of Jewish land/s outside Palestine\n• Suppressing Arab history of the land\nThe history of the question is structured, in the Zionist narratio, in a way to \nsecure the above Zionist historiographical targets. As a result the Zionist history \nof the question, elaborated earlier in this chapter as the Zionist historiography of \nthe pre-Zionist era of the land, was given a certain structure:\n• It has a certain beginning: The history of the land starts with the Jews’ \npresence in the land, ignoring others who possess the land before them,\n• The supposed Jewish time of the land, ancient Israel, is constructed as\nthe main history of the land in the pre-Zionist era: it is narrated, also, in a way to \nprovide the essentials of a Jewish state; such as ‘Jewish people’, ‘united Jewish \nkingdom’, and ‘Jewish independence’,\n149 | P a g e\n• This glorious Jewish time has a certain ending; the forced expulsion of \nthe Jews from the land, by the Romans, is articulated as the ending of the \n‘Jewish state’, and the main reason responsible for the absence of the Jews in \nthe land for the last two millennia,\n• The main bulk of the land’s history, the last 2000 years, that constitute\nalmost the whole documented history of the land is not taken as a significant \npiece of the land’s history; the main history of this time, according to the Zionist \nhistoriography, is located outside Palestine where Jews lived, who regarded, \nsupposedly, Palestine as their homeland; their history is summarised simply as \ntheir efforts to keep the link with the mother land, their hoping to return to it, and \ntheir waiting for the chance to do so.\nAccordingly, the land’s history is structured in a way that starts with the Jews, \nand ends with them, and leaves no space, in between, in the land’s thousands \nof years of history that might be filled by others’ history. This structure secures a \nhistory - long Jewishness of the land, providing a safe historiographical place for \nthe ‘Jews’ where they are not bothered by others’ presence, history and rights. \nThis constructed history can be exposed through a cyclical graph as follow:\n150 | P a g e\nAnalytical Procedure:\nThe Zionist narratio offers, I argue, a significant analytical tool to distinguish the \npro-Israeli account of the history of the Israel/Palestine question from non -\nIsraeli accounts. This narratio refers to a certain structure of pre-Zionist history \nthat constituted of certain Zionist historiographical elements with a power to \nintroduce the whole pre-Zionist era of the land as a Jewish homeland, as \nmentioned earlier. The pre-Zionist era of the land is chosen as a main place \nwhere the Zionist historiography can be recognized. This recognition, in fact, is \nlocated at the heart of this research, constituting the main goal of its textbook \nanalysis. This choice is based on the argument that the pre-Zionist history (of \nthe land) in general and ancient history in particular is so important for the \nZionist justification of Israel’s legitimacy that no pro-Israeli history of the \nquestion narrates Israel’s history without employing as truth the Zionist \nhistoriography of this time. It is assumed as such due to the crucial role ancient \nhistory plays in justifying the Zionist claim to the land. The legitimization of \nIsrael’s right to the land had no real chance to look convincing without a \nreference to ‘ancient Israel’ and Israel’s historical right to exist. As a result, \ntreating the pre-Zionist era of the land is taken, in this research, as a criterion \nfor recognizing pro-Israeli histories from others. In this way all six selected \ntextbooks on the history of Israel are investigated to analyse how they are \nstructured to treat the pre-Zionist history of the land. It is believed that this \nanalysis has the power to show a possible pro-Israeli bias in the analysed \ntextbooks.\nThe biased character of the analysed textbooks is determined based on its \ncapacity to pass the test of whether or not it embodies the main elements of the \nZionist historiography of the pre-Zionist history of the land or what is called later \nin the research the Zionist narratio. According to such analysis, a pro-Israeli \nhistory of the question works to cover, without any serious challenge or \nscientific scepticism, all main elements of the Zionist narratio starting the history \nof the land with the presence of Jews, and stressing their peoplehood and \nstatehood that concluded with a foreign, Roman, intervention that led to their \nforced expulsion from the land. Jews outside Palestine had no more important \nbusiness, for about 2000 years, than returning to the homeland, experiencing in \nthe interim an interruption to their collective life. At the same time the land, in its \n151 | P a g e\nturn, was brought to a sudden standstill, waiting to see the return of its real \nowners, with no authentic intervening experience of local population, people, \ncivilization, or any character that might demonstrate that the land has any owner \nother than the Jews. This story, according to some scholars, including Sand,\ndoes not represent a factual history; it is called mythistory, as mentioned earlier, \ndue to its mythical foundations (Shlomo Sand 2009, chap. 2). Pro-Israeli history, \nhowever, pays no serious attention to the problems and challenges of this story, \nand represents it as historical fact. That is why this history is considered biased\nin this research; the evidence we have now of that time does not allow an \nunbiased historian to pass those stories off as historical facts. As a result, any \ncase of such treatment of the question, where those Zionist claims are \npresented as historical facts, is taken as showing a pro-Israeli bias, and \ntextbooks that function as such are considered, accordingly, pro-Israeli \nhistories. It should be clear now, before moving to actual analysis of the \nselected textbooks, that the focus of this textbook analysis is not criticising or \nchallenging the pro-Israeli accounts that are offered in the selected textbooks; \nthe main point of analysis lies in examining the influence of the Zionist \nhistoriography on textbooks that are used, in Western academia, as \nauthoritative sources of the relevant knowledge.\nAnalysis of the First Textbook:\nThe book, Palestine and the Arab-Israeli conflict: A History with Documents, is \nwritten by an American scholar, Charles Duryea Smith, who is a lecturer in the \nUniversity of Arizona in the United States. The book is designed carefully to \nwork as a main reference for the relevant courses at college level. The text,\nenriched by almost 60 primary documents, 60 maps and many photographs is \nalso structured in clear chapters; each contains its own conclusion, chronology, \nand also some ‘questions for consideration’. The textbook has a website \ncompanion as well, to guide the students, and provide them with some \ninformation or images they might need to download for their course usage. \nSince 1988 when the first edition of the book appeared, many other editions \nhave been published; the eighth one is the most recent, published in 2013. The \nsurvey this research conducted, also confirms the book’s popularity in college \n152 | P a g e\ncourses. This survey suggests that the book is adopted widely in all 6 countries \nof the research; in 97 Syllabi in the USA, 17 in Canada, 16 in the UK, 6 in \nAustralia, 4 in New Zealand, and 3 in Ireland; altogether in 143 syllabi, in many \ncases as the main textbook of the course. This figure positions it higher than \nany other textbook that has been identified through this survey. The information \nprovided by Google Scholar also suggests that the book has been cited \nfrequently, 395 times, by other books or articles. The eighth edition of the book \nis taken for analysis in this research. The examined parts of the book are as \nfollows:\n Preface\n Prologue: The Arab-Israeli Conflict in Historical Perspective: The Middle \nEast and Palestine to 1517\n The first Chapter: Ottoman Society, Palestine, and the Origins of \nZionism, 1516-1914\n Epilogue\n Chronology\nOther parts of the book are left out since they don’t deal with the history of the \npre-Zionist era. The index of the book is used, at the final stage, to find any \nrelevant matter that might have been missed during the earlier parts of the \nexamination, or left out from the examination for the reasons just mentioned.\nAnalysis: The main body of the relevant historiography of the pre-Zionist era is \nnarrated through two constitutive sections in the opening of the book: in the \n‘Prologue’ and in the first chapter. The Prologue, which is designed to cover ‘the \nArab-Israeli Conflict in Historical Perspective’ is comprised of three relevant \nparts;\n Ancient Israel and Palestine to the Coming of Islam’\n ‘The Arabs and the spread of Islam’\n The chronology\nThese parts of the book are analysed according to the sequence of the book’s \ncontents. The Prologue starts with a non-Zionist statement; ‘Contrary to some \npopular misconceptions, the Palestinian and Arab-Israeli conflicts are modern \n153 | P a g e\nand secular in origin’ (C. D. Smith 2013, 1). The remainder of the paragraph \nelaborates how the recent Zionist involvement in Palestine led to the rise of this \nconflict. Against the above - mentioned statement, that introduces the modern \nand secular reasons, and not the religious one, as bearing the main \nresponsibility for the conflict, the next paragraph contextualizes the conflict in \nPalestine’s sacredness for all three monotheistic religions: Judaism, Christianity \nand Islam. This contextualization, putting the conflict in the religious context, is \nfar from the first statement (as mentioned above) as well as from non-Zionist \naccounts. The context, that of Palestine’s holiness, is used in Zionist \nhistoriography to support the Jewish right to the land through an argument, \npointed out in this section of the book, that the land is the holiest place for the \nJews, while it is only the third holiest site for Muslims. Furthermore, the Zionist \nhistoriography demonstrates more impact in this paragraph; ‘For Jews, \nPalestine was “Eretz Israel” the ancient land of Israel, the land they hoped to \nredeem as a modern Jewish state, a goal that was finally accomplished in 1948’ \n(C. D. Smith 2013, 1). It is, of course, a Zionist claim that Jews, during their \nhistory, hoped to redeem the land as a modern Jewish state. It is similarly \nproblematic to consider that what was established in 1948 was a goal whose\naccomplishment was hoped for by Jews throughout their history. This claim is \nrejected later in the book, itself, when this hope is characterized as a ‘traditional \nJewish yearning to return to Zion’ that ‘viewed the matter as one to be decided \nby God’ and not, in any case, a hope for establishing ‘a modern Jewish state’ \n(C. D. Smith 2013, 26).\nThe next section, Ancient Israel and Palestine to the Coming of Islam, is where \nthe main historiography of the book about the pre-Zionist era of Israel is offered. \nThe section starts with a significant statement that reveals the writer’s approach \nin taking into consideration the questions raised about the dominant history of \nancient Israel: ‘The past twenty years have seen a revolution in scholarship on \nancient Israel’ (C. D. Smith 2013, 2). It then, mentions the main claims of the \nZionist historiography about ancient Israel. The author’s comments on the \nmatter come later; ‘Recent scholarship, based on extensive archaeological \nexcavations, has challenged many of these assumptions’ (C. D. Smith 2013, 2). \nThe writer recognizes, in this section, some major challenges that question the \nhistoricity of Zionist historiography, challenges that discount the biblical stories \n154 | P a g e\nof a unified Jewish kingdom under David and Solomon. At the same time, it \nsuggests, according to what is called ‘mainstream scholars’, a ‘brief emergence \nof a unified Jewish state in all of Palestine, founded by Israel, the kingdom in \nthe north’ (C. D. Smith 2013, 2). Other than this, the writer places some \ndistance, through different means, between himself and the Zionist \nhistoriography, using phrases/terms such as ‘biblical tradition dates’ and \n‘supposed… kingships’ for this purpose (C. D. Smith 2013, 2). The Bible’s \nposition as a source of true history is discounted in the book’s account. The last \nstatement of the section, asserting this argument, stresses the fact that \narchaeological evidence does not support the Zionist claims of an ancient \nIsrael:\n‘The archaeological evidence thus summarized verifies the existence \nof Jewish settlements in Palestine prior to the appearance of Saul \nand David but views them as local tribal chiefs with little regional \ninfluence. The same can be said for Solomon, and no trace of his \npalace or temple has been found. Their mythical attainments were \ndeveloped in later versions of the Old Testament, most of them \ncomposed during the sixth and fifth centuries BCE’ (C. D. Smith \n2013, 2).\nAnother section of the book, Palestine under Roman and Byzantine Rule, is \nimportant for its involvement with another Zionist myth, the Jewish expulsion. \nThe first sentence, again, exhibits a non-Zionist approach to the question; ‘As \nsubjects of the Roman Empire, Jews in Palestine were allowed political and \nreligious autonomy as long as their rulers acknowledged Roman suzerainty’ (C. \nD. Smith 2013, 3). Other parts of this section do not represent a Zionist \nhistoriography with the Roman expulsion of the Jews at its centre. The \ndistancing of the book from the Zionist history of the expulsion is, however, a \nlimited one; on one side it stresses the opinion that ‘many Jews remained in \nPalestine’ after the Roman treatment of the Jewish rebellion (C. D. Smith 2013, \n3). In this sense it might reject the mass expulsion of the Jews. But, at the same \ntime, it offers alternative accounts that are not very far from the Zionist claims; \n‘Although many Jews remained in Palestine, they were concentrated \nin the Galilee and, as punishment for the rebellion, were forbidden to \n155 | P a g e\nenter Jerusalem, now in ruins. Jews outside Palestine far \noutnumbered those within it. Jewish communities had sprung up in \nthe Greco-Roman world prior to the Roman conquest, but their \nnumbers were small compared with those that resulted from the \ndispersions following the failed rebellions of 66 and 132 CE. \nNevertheless, Jews still considered Palestine to be Eretz Israel, the \nland promised them by God, and Jerusalem remained the focal point \nof their religious observances’ (C. D. Smith 2013, 3).\nThis statement can function to mean that the Roman expulsion of Jews (the \ndispersion following the failed rebellions) is the main source of a rise in the \nJewish population outside Palestine. Another part of this statement (Jews still \nconsidered Palestine to be Eretz Israel, the land promised them by God), can \nwork to support the Zionist claim that their presence outside Israel was \nprovisional, and that they still considered Israel as their home. In a later \nstatement the Romans are introduced as responsible, again, for making ‘the \nremainder’ of the Jewish population in Palestine leave the land: ‘He (the Roman \nemperor) imposed harsh tax measures throughout the empire, their application \nin Palestine led to a significant decline in the Jewish population. By 300 CE, \nJews made up one-half of the population in the Galilee and less than one-fourth \nin the rest of the region’ (C. D. Smith 2013, 4).\nUnlike mainstream Zionist historiography, the book concedes a substantial \nplace for an Arab history of the land. The second part of the book’s first section, \nthe Prologue, deals with this question; entitled ‘The Arabs and the Spread of \nIslam’. This part presents how Muslims came to control the land in the seventh \ncentury, and how this development characterized the history of the land till the \nmodern period. Muslim different treatments of the Jews and Christians, are also \nstressed in the book; ‘Unlike the Byzantines, Muslim authorities did not interfere \nin doctrinal matters and allowed Jews to visit and inhabit Jerusalem’ (C. D. \nSmith 2013, 7). A whole chapter, the next part of the book; Chapter 1: Ottoman \nsociety, Palestine, and the Origins of Zionism, is designed to cover the \nremainder of the Arab history of the land from 1516 onwards.\nThe chronology at the end of the Epilogue is of considerable importance for an \nanalysis of how the historical developments prior to the Ottoman control of the \n156 | P a g e\nland are listed. The chronology starts with the Canaanite control of the land, and \nnot the Jewish, as narrated frequently in Zionist historiography; ‘Canaanites \ninhabit Palestine West of Jordan River, Costal Lebanon, and southern Syria’ (C. \nD. Smith 2013, 10). The next development is characterized by Jewish and, \nnoticeably, Philistine settlement in the land: ‘Philistines and Jews settle in \nPalestine region of Canaan’ (C. D. Smith 2013, 10). A further significance of this \nchronology comes from the fact that, unlike the Zionist historiography of the era, \nthe supposed establishment of a Jewish united kingdom is not highlighted. But \nthe Jewish limited dispersion from the land by the Romans is stressed again: \n‘Bar Kokhba revolt against Romans, Roman retaliation results in dispersal of\nmany Jews, ending Palestine’s autonomy’ (C. D. Smith 2013, 10).\nThe next part of the book, the first chapter, covers the land’s history from 1516 \nto 1914 while the Ottomans controlled the land. This emphasis on the Arab \nhistory of the pre-Zionist era is not considered a Zionist tendency. It is recalled \nthat the Zionist historiography tends to ignore the Arab history of the land, and \nusually makes a 2000 - year jump, over the Arab history of the land, to succeed \nin this endeavour. The chapter has, also, other non-Zionist elements: it does not \ntry to introduce the land of this time as a barren and empty land with a few \nstrangers who lurk there waiting for its original owners to come and cultivate it. \nIt demonstrates the lively social and economic life of the land prior to the arrival \nof Zionism. It does not support, also, the Zionist claim of Palestine as a poor \nland that the Zionist settlers encountered when they came first: ‘As these \nfigures indicate a major expansion of Palestinian agricultural and industrial \nproductivity occurred before Zionist colonization’ (C. D. Smith 2013, 22). The \nbook refers to the internal sources of economic prosperity in the land including \nin the field of agriculture and pilgrimage. It also situates the Zionist contention of \n‘difference’ (between pre-Zionist Palestine and its the post-Zionist condition) in \nthe land’s prosperity in a reasonable context of the difference between \ntraditional means of economy and the modern technology that was brought by \nZionist settlers from the modern societies they came from in Europe, a \nphenomenon similar to what happened frequently in other European colonized \nlands (C. D. Smith 2013, 23–5). \n157 | P a g e\nThe first chapter, also, deals with Palestinian nationalism and identity; unlike the \nZionist historiography that uses nationalism as a tool to support the idea that a \nJewish nationalism has been planted in a land free of nationalist identity in order \nto reject the idea of occupying the other’s home to build one’s own, it stresses \nthe existence of Palestinian consciousness and their awareness of the land’s \nboundaries, at least among the educated Palestinians: ‘the new scholarship \ndoes suggest, however, that educated Palestinian Arabs considered \nthemselves to live in Palestine, establishing an identity with a region defined by \nboundaries. This identification was not simply the result of their encounter with \nJewish nationalism in the form of Zionism, as has often been assumed’ (C. D. \nSmith 2013, 25).\nThe text does not disregard the accusation that a Western criterion of \nnationalism was used to determine a land’s fate full of eastern characteristics of \nidentity, but it, of course, discounts the value of such an approach. It also \nreveals how this idea is used in Zionist historiography to justify the Zionist claim \nto the land: ‘Nationalism in the European sense was, however, part of Zionism \nand would be used to justify Zionist claims to Palestine, where a Jewish \nkingdom had existed two thousand years earlier’ (C. D. Smith 2013, 26). The \nbook’s apparent approach to making a balance in providing the competing \nnarratives leads, in some cases, to presenting some contradictory statements \nwith no formula to solve the contradiction. In the concluding remarks of this \nchapter, for instance, the Zionist claim about Palestinian nationalism, as a \nphenomenon that emerged when Palestine encountered Zionism, can be seen: \n‘Among educated Muslims and Christians in Palestine, Zionism contributed to a \ngrowing sense of their common identity as Palestinians’ (C. D. Smith 2013, 39). \nAnother statement made in the book, about Palestinian national consciousness\nalso does not concur with the discussion presented earlier in this regard, and \nreferred to above: ‘Nevertheless, a predominantly Palestinian Arab population \ndoes not necessarily indicate the widespread existence of a Palestinian Arab \nnational consciousness at this time’ (C. D. Smith 2013, 25).\nThe book also deals, in this chapter, with the controversial matter of immigrants \nto the land; the Zionist historiography, in line with the complementary lines of \nthe Zionist mega - narrative, tries to exaggerate the number of Arabs who might \n158 | P a g e\nhave migrated from the neighbouring lands to Palestine at the time when the \nZionist settlers came to the land, and also, makes clear efforts to sell the \nreligiously motivated migrations to the land, by some Jews, as the instances of \nredemptionist efforts to return home and establish their own state. The book \ndoes not subscribe to these stories, saying: ‘but during most of the century, the \nJews who came to Palestine did so for their own religious motives. They were \nmaking their pilgrimage to the land of ancient Israel, many in order to die there’ \n(C. D. Smith 2013, 24). In relation to the Arab migration, it considers that as a \nlimited factor: ‘Arabs undoubtedly did migrate to Palestine or were settled by \nOttoman officials there during this seventy-year period, but they probably \ncomprised no more than 8 percent of the Arab population of Palestine in 1914’ \n(C. D. Smith 2013, 25). Zionist historiography tends to consider Zionism as the \npeak of Jewish efforts to return to the homeland, and the final representative of \nthe Jewish redemptionist efforts that started right from the expulsion and lasted \nfor 2000 years of diaspora. Against this claim, the book considers Zionism a \nmodern phenomenon different from the Jewish traditional attachment to Zion: \n‘Modern Zionism differed from the traditional Jewish yearning to return to Zion, \nEretz Israel, in that religious Jews viewed the matter as one to be decided by \nGod. Just as their exile reflected Yahweh’s punishment of Jews for their \ntransgressions of His Laws, so would their return indicate that he had granted \nthem redemption, a redemption that many believed could occur only when the \nend of the world was at hand’ (C. D. Smith 2013, 26). Against this statement, \n‘the Jewish commitment to the idea of a return to Eretz Israel’ is considered, in \nthe book, as a centuries’ long reality that was a challenge to the assimilationist \ndesire of Jews to be part of the French nation: \n‘The French Revolution of 1789 and its Declaration of the Rights of \nMan proclaimed the equality of all people as the basis for true \ncitizenship. Jews were specifically offered the opportunity to \nassimilate as individuals into French society. Assimilation meant that \nJews would presumably give up their commitment to retain their \ndistinctiveness as a separate community adhering to Jewish laws \nand, with that, their commitment to the idea of a return to Eretz Israel, \na hope that had bound them together for centuries’ (C. D. Smith \n2013, 27).\n159 | P a g e\nThe book refers, in this chapter, to the very different nature of the Jewish\u0002Islamic relations in the land that were characterized by a governance of \npeaceful coexistence to the extent that each took part in the religious \nceremonies of the other; the Muslim Nebi Musa festival, celebrating the birth of \nMoses, is mentioned as one instance (C. D. Smith 2013, 39). The book can \nwork, also, to clarify that these relations were interrupted by the Zionist \nmovement. It is stated, in the opening of the Prologue, that ‘Palestinian and \nother Arabs, Christian as well as Muslim, opposed this movement not because \nof Jewish immigration per se, but because Jewish statehood would \nautomatically deny political rights to Palestinian Arabs, as was made clear in the \nBalfour Declaration of 1917’ (C. D. Smith 2013, 1). In this chapter, there is \nanother non-Zionist approach when the Palestinian Jews are considered closer \nto Arabs than the Europeans who came to the land to materialize the Zionist \nproject: ‘Out of the approximately 85,000 Jews then in Palestine, 12,000 lived \non the land. Most Palestinian Jews were in their dress and appearance not \ndissimilar from Arabs, part of a Middle Eastern society quite different from the \nvision imparted by the European Jews who now appeared’ (C. D. Smith 2013, \n33).\nThe chronology offered at the end of the book also supports the idea that the \nbook does not follow a Zionist historiographical pattern; it starts with a Zionist \ncontention of the ‘Kingdom of Israel and Judah founded’ (C. D. Smith 2013 \nChronology). But no efforts are made, in this section, to install other main \nelements of the Zionist historiography; the united Jewish kingdom under David \nand Solomon, the Jewish dispersion, or any reference to their supposed \nattempts to return, can be mentioned, for instance.\nSummary of the Analysis\nThe above-mentioned analysis suggests that the book is not structured to serve \na Zionist history of the land. A distance from pro-Israeli works is registered in \nthe book’s beginning, in the Preface, when the possibility of a difference \nbetween Israeli and Arab scholars is recognized: ‘… depending on the topic, \nthis may mean that I sometimes refer to more works by Israeli scholars than by \nArabs’ (C. D. Smith 2013, VI). The index, at the end of the book, can also \n160 | P a g e\nexhibit that Zionist terminology is not used extensively in the book although \nsome references are made; ‘Exodus’ and ‘Aliya’ for instance. The book is not \ndesigned, I conclude, to advance the Zionist story of the pre-Zionist era: the \nZionist history of ancient Israel is challenged in the book; the historicity of the \nBible is discounted; the supposed Roman forceful expulsion is narrated in a \ndifferent and milder wording; nothing serious about the supposed Jewish \nredemptionist efforts to return to the Holy Land is mentioned, and finally, the \nArab history of the land is taken as a significant part of the land’s history. The \nland before Zionism, in the book’s account, is not an empty land that waits for \nthe original owners, the Jews, to come back and make it prosper. At the same \ntime, the dominance of the Zionist mythology over the relevant literature is not \nregarded as a problem in understanding the history of the question. As a result \nno real attempt is made to reveal the grave consequences of the Zionist \ninfluential narrative on how the history of the land is perceived. The book does \nnot seek to free the history of the question from the Zionist mythology; it is \nregarded, alternatively, as a natural phenomenon that occurs under the \ninfluence of ‘mainstream scholars’. The book, however, is successful in \ndistancing itself from Zionist claims, when it engages historiography but, at the \nsame time, relies extensively on the Zionist histories for the provision of details. \nThe accounts from both sides are offered in some cases, in an attempt, \napparently, to create balance. This approach leads, sometimes, to producing \ncontradictory accounts with no consideration mentioned about how this \ncontradiction can be solved or how this contradiction in historical reports can \nrelate to what really happened. As a result, the reader remains wondering which \none represents the true history of the question. The book’s account of the main \nelements of Israel’s pre-Zionist history is mostly different from the Zionist history \nbut is not, at the same time, very far from it, as demonstrated by this analysis, in \nvarious cases. The book, however, is a good example of a Western scholarly \nattempt to distance itself from the dominant history of the land that was \ninfluenced heavily by Zionist historiography, despite its limited achievements in \ndoing so.\n161 | P a g e\nAnalysis of the Second Textbook:\nThe book, A Concise History of the Arab-Israeli Conflict, is co-authored by two \nscholars in the field, Ian J. Bickerton, from University of New South Wales in \nAustralia, and Carla L. Klausner from University of Missouri-Kansas City in the \nUSA. The first edition of the book was published by Prentice Hall in 1991. Three \nother editions have been produced in 1995, 1998, and 2001 before the book’s \ntitle changes to ‘A History of the Arab-Israeli Conflict’. ‘Concise’ as a component \nof the original title has been removed in this change when the book grew in size \nfrom a short one (about 300 pages) to a 448 page volume. The fifth edition and \nthe sixth one (2009) are published under the new title. The third edition of the \nbook (1998 - 335 pages) is taken for analysis in this study. This edition’s \ncontents are structured in 11 chapters, as follows, that deal with the question’s \nhistory in chronological order:\n1. Palestine in the Nineteenth Century\n2. Palestine During the Mandate\n3. World War II, Jewish Displaced Persons, and Palestine\n4. The UN, Israel Established, the First Arab - Israeli War\n5. The Conflict Widens: Suez, 1956\n6. The Turning Point: June 1967\n7. Holy Days and Holy War: October 1973\n8. The Search for Peace\n9. Lebanon and the Intifada\n10.Peace of the Brave\n11.The Peace Progresses\nMore chapters are added to the volume in the later edition of the book that deal\nwith recent developments of the question including ‘The Collapse of the Peace \nProcess’ and ‘The Arab-Israeli Conflict in the Post 9/11 World’. These chapters \nare preceded by a ‘Preface’ and then an ‘Introduction’, and are followed by a \n‘Conclusion’. The book is furnished with a noticeable number of charts, maps \nand tables that can enhance its position as a common textbook. All chapters are \nequipped with relevant original documents and a suggested list for further \nreading. Some segments of the book, those that might be relevant to the \n162 | P a g e\nanalysis in this study, are examined for the sake of this research, including the \nfollowing ones:\n Preface \n Introduction \n Chapter 1: Palestine in the Nineteenth Century\n Conclusion\nThe Index is used, in the final stage, to spot any relevant content that might \nhave gone unnoticed through the earlier stages of the analysis. The survey \nconducted for the sake of this thesis demonstrates that the book is taken as a \ntextbook in four countries of the survey; the US (118 syllabi), Canada (8), the \nUK (5) and Australia (5). These results suggest that the book is adopted widely \nin the USA and Australia; it is the most adopted textbook, on the question’s \nhistory, in American academia in fact. But the overall ranking of the book \nintroduces it as the second most adopted textbook in Western universities,\nhaving been adopted, altogether, in 136 academic courses. The citing figure of \nthe book in Google Scholar, 146, is not high compared with other selected \ntextbooks but is sufficient to suggest that it is a main reference for other \nscholarly work.\nThe book does not say much about the way it treats the history of the question; \nit stresses, however, ‘balance’ and ‘objectivity’: ‘we have attempted to achieve \nsome balance and objectivity about a subject upon which most people feel it \nnecessary to adopt a partisan point of view’(Bickerton and Klausner 1998, xvi). \nIt recognizes that there are two histories on two sides of the question, \nintroducing the book’s approach as based on presenting both, while confessing \nthat this approach does not free it from subjectivity: ‘Throughout the book, we \nhave tried to present both sides of the issues, although we realize that even the \nselection of material to be included reveals some subjective judgment on our \npart’(Bickerton and Klausner 1998, xvi). There is a brief attempt in the book to \nreveal its main goal: ‘The primary object of this book is to make the Arab-Israeli \nconflict more intelligible without the distortions that result from \noversimplification’(Bickerton and Klausner 1998, 2). This statement might be too \ngeneral to reveal something meaningful about the book’s attitude. What has \nbeen added to this statement suggests some sort of ‘claim equality’ as a leading \n163 | P a g e\ntheme of the text: ‘Both the Arabs and the Israelis are locked into the histories \nthey have created for themselves - into the dreams of their pasts. Both also \nseek to set in our minds favorable cultural images and symbols of themselves \nand unfavorable ones of their opponents’(Bickerton and Klausner 1998, 2). \nThis, also, means recognizing the fact that there is a pro-Israeli history, besides\na pro-Palestinian one, and the necessity of assuming a distance from both in \nthe interests of grasping the truth.\nAnalysis: the book’s treatment of the pre-Zionist history of the question, and of \n‘ancient Israel’ in particular, is truly concise; no particular part is designed to \ncover the history of that time. Numerous references, however, are made in \ndifferent parts of the book, especially in the Introduction and Chapter I, which \ncan provide a picture of that time for the reader. The Introduction is, in fact, the \nmain place where this picture is depicted. One paragraph, more than any other \nsegment of the book, offers the history of ‘ancient Israel’:\n‘Judaism has gone through several stages in its long history. The first \nstage could be said to be that described in the Hebrew Bible, \nconsisting of the Torah, the books of the Prophets, and a collection of \nother writings such as Kings, Chronicles, Ruth, Esther, and the Song \nof Solomon. It tells of the Jews’ search under Moses for the land \npromised them by God after their expulsion from Egypt (the Exodus) \nand describes the Kingdoms of David and Solomon. The boundaries \nof Solomon’s kingdom, with Jerusalem as its capital, included the \nareas called Judea and Samaria, and extreme religious and \nnationalistic groups today insist that these biblical and historical \nboundaries of Eretz Yisrael, or the Land of Israel, must remain under \nJewish control’(Bickerton and Klausner 1998, 5).\nThe main elements of the Zionist historiography of the ancient time, the \nkingdom of David and Solomon, Jerusalem as the capital of the Jewish \nkingdom, and the boundaries of the kingdom (that take in the whole of historical \nPalestine), are incorporated in this narrative but the Hebrew Bible, is introduced \nas the source of this story. What comes before and after this narrative has the \npower to introduce the story as a report of history, and not only as a religious \ntradition; the pre-narrative statement, (Judaism has gone through several \n164 | P a g e\nstages in its long history) introduces the narrative as a report of history. This \nhas been confirmed after the narrative when boundaries of Eretz Yisrael are \ncalled not only ‘biblical’ but also ‘historical’. The language of the book, however, \nappears more accommodating when the remaining part of the ancient history is \nat stake; it is not conditioned by a particular source; it is narrated as a true \nreport of what happened:\n‘The northern part of the kingdom, or Samaria, was conquered by the \nAssyrians in 721 B.C.E.* The Jews of the southern kingdom, or \nJudea, were exiled to Babylonia in 586 B.C.E. after the destruction of \nthe First Temple built by Solomon in Jerusalem, which had become \nthe center of Jewish worship until it was destroyed by the army of \nKing Nebuchadnezzar.(Bickerton and Klausner 1998, 5)’\nThe Jewish kingdoms of ‘Samaria’ and ‘Judea’ and their supposed fate are \nintroduced in this part. A Jewish Autonomy is, also, suggested as the last \nchapter of Jewish ancient settlement in the land. The Roman expulsion of the \nJews is suggested as the main factor responsible for the termination of Jewish \ncontrol of the land; ‘Restored to Palestine by the Persians, the Jews built a \nSecond Temple in Jerusalem and lived autonomously under a succession of \nforeign rulers until 70 C.E. when the Romans destroyed the Second Temple \nand dispersed the Jews (the Diaspora)’(Bickerton and Klausner 1998, 5). The \nrest of the text reveals that the Zionist historiography didn’t leave its footprint \njust on the generalities of the book but on its details; ‘One of the last \nstrongholds to fall to the Romans was the hillside fortress known as Masada. \nThe Israeli slogan “Masada shall never fall again” has come to symbolize \nIsrael's determination to fight to the death to maintain its national sovereignty. It \nis thus significant that recruits of the Israel Armoured Corps swear their \nallegiance at Masada’(Bickerton and Klausner 1998, 6). The role of the Roman \ntreatment of the Jews in the Jewish disappearance from the land has been \ndiscounted, however, in the next chapter of the book (Chapter I); \n‘Most historians agree that Jews migrated from Palestine voluntarily \nlong before the Christian epoch, forming merchant classes around \nthe Mediterranean basin. The destruction of the Second Temple by \nthe Romans in the year 70 C.E. led to a considerable increase in the \n165 | P a g e\nnumber of the Jewish Diaspora, as those Jews who lived outside \nPalestine were called, and they were gradually transformed into a \nmercantile class’(Bickerton and Klausner 1998, 21).\nThere are other references to ‘ancient Israel’ in other parts of the book, usually \nwhen other matters are at stake, which reinforces the Zionist narrative of the \nera. The following is an example:\n‘Jerusalem also occupies a special place for Muslims. Sura (or \nchapter) 17 of the Qur’an recounts a mystical night journey of \nMuhammad to Jerusalem, to a spot known today as the Temple \nMount, the platform upon which Solomon’s and later Herod’s \nTemple once stood. From here, he ascended to heaven for a vision \nof Allah. The Western Wall, all that remains today of Herod’s \nTemple, and the Muslim shrines known as the Dome of the Rock \nand the al-Aqsa Mosque on the Temple Mount are important symbols \nfor Jews and Muslims, and Jerusalem is a focal point of the Arab \nIsraeli conflict’(Bickerton and Klausner 1998, 7).\nThe book articulates historical Palestine as a homeland for both Jews and \nPalestinian Arabs, but the definition it provides of homeland is influenced \nheavily by the Zionist narrative:\n‘The most important aspect of landscape to the Jews and Arabs of \nPalestine is the concept of homeland and the meaning attached to \nthis concept. Almost all concepts of homeland have included the \nnotion that such a place is the center of the world and that it is of \nsupreme value. A homeland is usually tied to a specific location \nspiritually; it is a place to consort and speak with the gods, and \ncontinuity with the location takes on a special meaning, with \ndislocation causing chaos. This was especially true of the ancient \nreligions. We must also keep in mind that the value people attach to \nsuch concepts are historically as well as culturally derived. A \nhomeland provides nourishment, permanency, reassurance, and an \nidentification with the soil, and it provides historical ties of identity. \nLooked at in this way, we can quickly see that Palestine takes on \n166 | P a g e\nspecial significance to the two groups who have been in such bitter \nconflict for almost a century’(Bickerton and Klausner 1998, 10–11).\nThis idea of ‘homeland’ is reinforced in other statements in the book: ‘There has \nbeen, and still exists, a very close link between the landscape and the pattern of \nsettlement in Palestine. These patterns, reinforced by historical, cultural, and \nreligious experiences, reflect fundamental attitudes that the inhabitants, both \nArabs and Jews, hold about the region and their identification with it as place \nand homeland’(Bickerton and Klausner 1998, 14). Moreover, there are other \ncases of referring to the land as the Jews’ homeland in the book: ‘This \naspiration tapped another trend among the traditionalist Jews of Eastern \nEurope-that of preserving Judaism and the Jewish tradition through the \nreestablishment of a religiously based Jewish culture located in the traditional \nJewish homeland Eretz Yisrael’(Bickerton and Klausner 1998, 25).\nThe book takes the Jews as a people, a nation that has existed since ancient \ntimes. But the statements it makes in this regard are contradictory in some \ninstances. There is one instance, at least, of distancing from such a Zionist \nclaim: ‘Although Jews consider themselves a people, as do the Arabs, Jews are \nnot simply a nationality, are not a race, and are more than a religion. They are \nat once an ethnic group, a religious group, and a cultural group’(Bickerton and \nKlausner 1998, 4). The book forgets this position when granting Jews, clearly, \nthe status of a people, in another part of the book: ‘Judaism is unique in that it is \na religion limited to one people…’(Bickerton and Klausner 1998, 9). \nFurthermore, Jews are recognized in the book as a nation: ‘The coming \ntogether of these two aspirations-one secular, the other religious-led to the birth \nof modern Zionism as a political ideology and organizational tool, and it \ncontributed to the settlements that became the foundation of the economic, \nsocial, and cultural rebirth of the Jewish nation’(Bickerton and Klausner 1998, \n25). Other relevant Zionist claims are also taken as history in the book; rejecting \nthe idea of Jewish converts, thus providing a safe space for the introduction of\nall Jews of different colours and nationalities as one people, is confirmed in the \nbook; ‘Although in many respects Judaism and Islam are similar, important \ndifferences exist that lead to tension between the two religious groups. While \nJudaism is not a proselytizing religion, and does not seek converts…’(Bickerton \n167 | P a g e\nand Klausner 1998, 9). The book takes a clear Zionist approach to the history \nwhen considering the European Zionists who came to Palestine in the 20th\ncentury and claimed the land, as the same Jews who supposedly lived in the \nland thousands of years ago. This idea is reinforced when the book blames \nPalestinians for their treatment of the Jewish settlers as outsiders: ‘Jews are \nseen by Arabs as violent and cowardly, ignoring the ancient ties of the Jews to \nPalestine, the Arabs regard them as aliens, as outsiders, as interlopers who do \nnot belong’(Bickerton and Klausner 1998, 5).\nNo particular section is designed in the book to report the main bulk of the \nland’s history, a time period after Roman control of the land in the first century \nand before the arrival of Zionist immigrants in the twentieth, a period of almost 2 \nmillennia when Jews, except for a few, were absent. The Zionist historiography, \nas mentioned earlier, tries to fill this self-constructed gap with the Jews’ history \nin other places where they, supposedly, consider Palestine as their homeland, \nmaking efforts to return to it. The book accommodates this constructed gap but \nwhat it offers to fill it with, ‘the redemptionist efforts,’ is quite limited; ‘The Jewish \nreturn to Jerusalem and to Zion (Mount Zion, which came to stand for the Holy \nCity and the Holy Land) became a central part of Jewish ritual and ceremonial \npractice’(Bickerton and Klausner 1998, 6). Besides confirming the Jewish \nattachment to the land in this period of time and the prayer to return, it rejects \nthe idea that Jews have taken practical steps to return to Palestine before \nZionism could change their condition:\n‘Many Zionists have explained the increase in Jewish settlement in \nPalestine as a reflection of the growing appeal and strength of \nZionism. The difficulty with this explanation is that, despite the deep \nfeeling of attachment to the land of Israel, which is such a distinctive \nfeature of Jewish self-identity, the simple reality is that Jews did not \nmove to the land of Zion, a land they prayed to be delivered to three \ntimes a day. This is the paradox of Zionism. Only about 1 percent of \nthe almost 3 million Jews who emigrated from Russia in the thirty-five \nyears following 1880 went to Palestine, and very few emigrated from \nWestern Europe’(Bickerton and Klausner 1998, 27).\n168 | P a g e\nThis non-Zionist assertion does not lead the book to question the Zionist claim \nof a Jewish striving to return; the rest (of the statement) justifies it in fact: \n‘Zionism was not the answer to the Jewish question” for the great majority of \nJews. This is largely because Zionism was not seen as a solution to the \ntraditional Jewish problems of economic, political, social, religious, and racial \noppression in Europe’(Bickerton and Klausner 1998, 27). The book provides \ntwo other notions that support the idea that Jewish nationalism, i.e. Zionism, \nwas not a modern invention, but a reality that governed Jewish history in the\ndiaspora. The first one is the notion of ‘cultural’ or ‘religious’ nationalism: ‘Like \nArab nationalism, Jewish nationalism remained a religious and cultural \nphenomenon until the nineteenth century, when the idea of creating a Jewish \nstate in Eretz Yisrael assumed the character of a political ideology’(Bickerton \nand Klausner 1998, 19). In this notion, all the religious and cultural attention\npaid by the Jews of the diaspora to the Holy Land is interpreted as a political \nand national reality. ‘Modern Zionism’ is the second notion that introduces \nZionism as a modern version of a traditional Jewish movement that existed long \nbefore Herzl, as a longstanding character of Jewish life in the diaspora. In this \nway Jewish messianism is regarded as an earlier version of Zionism where \nZionism is called secular messianism. Zionism, according to this book, has not \ninvented a new ideology; it ‘transformed the passive, quietistic, and pious hope \nof the Return to Zion into an effective social force’(Bickerton and Klausner 1998, \n27).\nLike many Zionist histories of the land, Palestine before the Zionists’ arrival, is \nportrayed very negatively as a poor and insecure land;\n‘Palestine had been a poor and neglected part of the Ottoman \nEmpire. Over the previous two centuries, local governors had \nbecome independent of Ottoman control, had become corrupt, and \nhad neglected their duties. The result was that there was \nconsiderable disorder and insecurity: public works had not been \ncarried out; agriculture and trade had declined: and the majority of \nthe population were impoverished and oppressed’(Bickerton and \nKlausner 1998, 16).\n169 | P a g e\nThe book, at the same time, takes a non-Zionist turn while introducing \nimprovements brought to the land by Ottoman Emperor, Sultan Abdul-Hamid II:\n‘During the second half of the nineteenth century, the Ottomans \ngradually reestablished central control, Bedouin attacks became less \nfrequent, general security increased, oppression of the urban \npopulation diminished somewhat, and the European powers greatly \nexpanded their involvement in Palestine, as in the rest of the Levant. \nAs a result, the area’s economy and the conditions of the inhabitants \nsignificantly improved. Under Sultan Abdul-Hamid II, who ruled the \nOttoman Empire from 1876 to 1909, important changes took place in \nPalestine. Abdul-Hamid encouraged modernization in \ncommunications, education, and the military in order to strengthen \nhis control. When he began his rule, Palestine had no railroad, hardly \nany carriage roads, and no developed port. There were few medical \nservices, and disease and illiteracy were widespread. Within a few \nyears of accession, new roads were opened. And European \ncompanies completed a railroad between Jerusalem and Jaffa in \n1892 and another between Haifa and Deraa, Transjordan, in \n1905’(Bickerton and Klausner 1998, 16–18).\nThe Zionist historiography needs to provide some background of Jewish \nauthority/Jewish independence in Palestine; having no chance to mine these \nnotions from the established history of the land, it employs the religious \ntraditions of Judaism for such a purpose; in this enterprise, a Jewish sense of \nauthority, in a tribal context or in any kind of autonomy under former kinds of \npolitical organisation, is taken as an instance of Jewish political control of the \nland. This Zionist historiographical machine works in the opposite direction \nwhen the same land, but populated with Arab Palestinians, is at stake; there is a \ntremendous effort to portray Palestine, before Zionism, as a land free from any \ncharacter of political power, a condition, according to Zionist history, that lasted \nfor centuries before it was remedied by Zionist Jews. This book, like many other \nbooks in the field, has been influenced by this Zionist construction; ‘Under \nOttoman rule, which lasted four centuries (1516—1918), Palestine never formed \na political administrative unit of its own’(Bickerton and Klausner 1998, 16). The \n170 | P a g e\nZionist historiography, for understandable reasons, deprives Palestine not only \nof any political administration/power but of any political identity as well. The \nidea of nationalism is used in Zionist histories for such a purpose. The \nPalestinians are introduced as a people free from nationalist feelings before \nencountering Zionism. This Zionist history is confirmed in the book; ‘As a result \nof all the factors mentioned above, there was no strong impetus toward \nPalestinian nationalism among the Muslim Arabs during this period’(Bickerton \nand Klausner 1998, 19). According to this report, Palestinian nationalism is \nformed only later, and as a response to a genuine and stronger nationalism: ‘As \ntime passed, nationalist sentiment among Arabs, including those in Palestine, \nalso grew as a response to the strong nationalist feelings of Jews toward \nPalestine, or Eretz Yisrael (the Land of Israel)’(Bickerton and Klausner 1998, \n19). \nSummary of the Analysis\nThe analysis of the book, so far, suggests the idea that it reproduces the bulk of\nZionist history in relation to ‘ancient Israel’, the exile and the history of the Jews \nin the diaspora. The limited, and noticeable in some cases, distance placed, by \nthe book between self and Zionist historiography is acknowledged in the \nanalysis. Having said that, the Zionist meta - narrative of the land has been \naccepted, more or less, as factual history in this textbook. The book has been \ninfluenced by other Zionist narratives, including that on Jewish political \nindependence outside Palestine; the book not only ignores these polities but \nrejects their existence:\n‘Judaism differs from both Islam and Christianity in one important \nrespect however. Both Islam and Christianity were militarily and \npolitically successful over the centuries, establishing empires or \nstates in which their respective beliefs and principles were put into \npractice. Judaism had no such experience from the destruction of the \nSecond Temple in 70 C.E. until the establishment of Israel in \n1948’(Bickerton and Klausner 1998, 9).\n171 | P a g e\nThe overall analysis of this book, however, does not produce the conclusion \nthat it is a Zionist work, not because of the limited but significant reservations it \nmakes when delivering the Zionist historiography, but because of the genuine \nsympathy it shows with the Palestinian rights to the land, a factor that is absent \nin Zionist histories. The book advances, in this way, some sort of ‘claim \nequality’; it considers both Jews and the Palestinian Arabs as peoples with true \nlinks to the land: ‘It is impossible to understand the depth of feeling on both \nsides without an awareness of the ecological or environmental relationship that \nexists between the Jews and Arabs who inhabit the region, as well as the \nhistorical and cultural ties that link the two peoples to the land’(Bickerton and \nKlausner 1998, 11). The book’s enthusiasm to provide some sympathy with\nboth sides of the conflict through establishing the claim equality to the land \nintroduces some misleading problems, however; first of all the difference \nbetween myth and fact is suppressed in this approach. No serious efforts are \nmade to question the narratives provided by Zionist historiography, including \nthose for which there is no convincing evidence in any established history of \nPalestine, such as narratives that are related to ancient Israel or the Roman \nexpulsion of the Jews. This is in fact at odds with what the book itself\nrecommends to students of history:\n‘The distinction between the past and the present is an artificial one; \nthere is only the present. But constructing and controlling “the truth” \nabout the past to justify one’s actions in the present is an important \nfunction of all political activity, and one task of a student of history is \nto separate the rhetoric designed by both sides to create a usable, \nlegitimizing, and heroic past from the reality of past events’(Bickerton \nand Klausner 1998, 2).\nThe declared necessity of separating the rhetoric from the reality of the past \nevents is undermined by the book’s attempt to sympathize with, and \naccommodate both sides of the conflict. This approach proves more \nproblematic, leading to serious mistakes, when advancing the claim equality.\nIntroducing the conflict as the extension of a historical rivalry/battle between \nJews and Arabs over the land, a struggle that has existed since biblical times, is \none instance:\n172 | P a g e\n‘Many see the Arab-Israeli conflict as the present-day extension of \nenmity that has existed since biblical times. The issues underlying \nthe conflict strike at the heart of the identity of the peoples involved. \nIn addition to being the contemporary expression of a historic \nterritorial battle over Palestine between two traditional ethnic rivals, \nJews and Arabs’(Bickerton and Klausner 1998, 1).\nIn this line, religion is introduced as a reason for why Jews and Arabs oppose \neach other in Palestine, neglecting a millennium long history of Jewish-Arab \npeaceful co - existence in the Holy Land. There is considerable emphasis on \nthe religious aspect of the question; and on the differences between Islam and \nJudaism as a main feature responsible for the conflict; ‘A key question in both \nreligions as far as the Arab-Israeli conflict is concerned is: What is the attitude \nof the religion to the outsider. Both religions are ambiguous and contradictory in \nrelation to this question. They make positive and negative references to others \nand are both welcoming and exclusive’(Bickerton and Klausner 1998, 9).\nThe results of this analysis do not suggest that the book is a history that is \nstructured to advance a Zionist version of the Palestinian/Israeli conflict. But it \nintroduces the book as a work that is influenced heavily by Zionist \nhistoriography. The book does not take a critical attitude toward Zionist \nhistoriography. It takes it for granted in many cases, defining a Jew for instance, \naccording to the terms provided by one side, the Jewish side, and accepting \nthis definition as a true representation of reality; ‘The term Jew can be best \napplied to those who have a Jewish mother, or who call themselves Jews \nbecause of conversion to Judaism’(Bickerton and Klausner 1998, 4). The book, \nhowever, takes a critical position towards the role of the West in the question. \n‘Orientalism’ and ‘anti-Semitism’ are introduced as two Western destructive \nideologies that have influenced the conflict. Islam and Christianity are also \nblamed for what went wrong in this question but Zionism and Judaism are \nexempted from such critical treatment in so far as it is related to the reporting of \nthe pre-Zionist history of the Israel/Palestine question(Bickerton and Klausner \n1998, 4).\n173 | P a g e\nAnalysis of the Third Textbook:\nThe book, Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist – Arab Conflict, is written \nby the Israeli writer, Benny Morris, a Professor of History at Ben-Gurion \nUniversity in Israel, and published by numerous publishing companies including \nVintage Books in New York. The first edition of the book, that covered the \nhistory of the conflict from 1881 to 1999, was published in 1999. The edition \nused for this study is the one that was published in 2001 and covers the history \nof the conflict to this year.\nThe textbook is a long volume, about 800 pages, which offers the history of the \nquestion in 14 chapters; the last one deals with Barak’s government: ‘Ehud \nBarak's 19 Months’. Some portions of the book, those that are seen as relevant \nto the pre-Zionist era are examined for the sake of this analysis; they include \nthe following parts:\n• Preface\n• Chapter One: Palestine on the Eve\n• Chapter Two: The Beginning of the Conflict: Jews and Arabs in \nPalestine, 1881-1914\n• Conclusions\nThe Index is used, in the next phase, to find relevant parts in the book that \nmight be missed in the earlier examinations. \nThe textbook has widespread usage in academic courses; the survey that was \nconducted for this purpose suggests it as the third most adopted textbook in \nWestern universities. It is one of 2 books, the other being ‘Palestine and the \nArab-Israeli Conflict’, which are adopted in all 6 countries of the survey. The \nmain difference between these two texts lies in the fact that unlike Smith’s book, \nthis textbook is not used widely as the main textbook of the course. This survey \ndemonstrates that it has been adopted, altogether, in 123 syllabi: 82 Syllabi in \nthe USA, 18 in the UK, 15 in Canada, 4 in Ireland, 2 in Australia, and 2 in New \nZealand. The Google Scholar citation figure also confirms its extensive impact \n174 | P a g e\nin the academic arena where 459 is suggested as a number for citations of the \nbook in other academic publications.\nThe book starts with a ‘Preface’ where some useful information about the \nperspective that is adopted on the question’s history is provided; the first \nstatement introduces this history as an attempt to ‘relate the entire story in an \nintegrated fashion, covering Israel, the Palestinians, and the Arab states from \nthe 1880s to the present’(Morris 2001, xiii). The next clarification indicates that \nthe political and military aspects of the conflict, and not the economic and \ncultural ones, are being focused on in this historiography. It is also mentioned \nthat little attention is given to the internal politics of the conflicting societies. The \nwriter introduces his approach to the history as a rejection of the maxim that \n\"there is no foreign policy, only internal politics\" (Morris 2001, xiii). The last \nclarification, mentioned in the Preface, spells out that the book’s history is \nbased on secondary sources, and does not constitute a work that is produced \nby analysis of original historical documents itself (Morris 2001, xiii).\nAnalysis: the textbook has its own way of treating the question; it is categorized \nas a historiography out of the traditional Zionist realm, representing a critical \nwork, and, at the same time, with the potential to reinforce Zionist mythology. \nThe Preface might shed some light on this matter: first of all, it considers all \nworks produced to date in this field as biased historiography: ‘Almost from the \nstart the subject has been treated with emphatic partisanship by commentators \nand historians from both sides, as well as by foreign observers’(Morris 2001, \nxiii). The book regards this bias as a characteristic that comes from the \nquestion’s nature, and one difficult or impossible to avoid: ‘There is a built-in \nimbalance in scholarly treatments of the conflict; this study is no \nexception’(Morris 2001, xiv). This is not, of course, a typical Zionist position on \nthe historiography produced on the question. In this line, this book, and other \nwritings of Benny Morris, are full of critiques of the Zionist narratives that no \nclassic Zionist history can dare to offer. Lots of accounts offered by the book \nchallenge the classic Zionist history. The whole historical evidence that is used \nby the Zionist side to write the question’s history is undermined in the book: ‘By \nand large, the documents contained in them were written by Zionists, in a \nZionist context and from the Zionist perspective. This has almost inevitably \n175 | P a g e\naffected the historiography based on these documents’(Morris 2001, xiv). The \nArab view of the question has found its way into his historiography in many \ncases. At the same time, the work tends to put the Zionist historiography, even \ncriticized or challenged, in a relatively better position, where its superiority over \nthe Arab history can be perceived. This can be seen in the book’s general \narguments about the subject, as well as, in its treatment of particular cases; ‘At \nthe same time the Zionist side tends to be illuminated more thoroughly and with \ngreater precision than the Arab side, and this applies to both political and \nmilitary aspects’(Morris 2001, xiv). Another general statement in the book can \ndemonstrate this: ‘Though Jewish officials, generals, and politicians have often \nalso been self serving and subjective in their published recollections, and past \ngenerations of Zionist-Israeli historians have been less than objective, they \nhave been substantially more accurate and informative than their Arab \ncounterparts’(Morris 2001, xiv). For having such a tendency the book, like other \nof Morris’s writings, might be seen as a work that challenges the traditional \nZionist claims as well as Arab alternative accounts at the same time in one way, \nand, in the next, favours the Zionist story over its Arab rival, usually through the \nconclusion. Having said this, however, this might not be the case in all matters \nraised in the book.\nThe Preface does not have any reference to the history of the pre-Zionist era; \nthe next section, Chapter One: Palestine on the Eve, is the main location in the \nbook where that history is offered. The book, in fact, has no independent \nsegment to present such a history; it is very brief about ancient Israel for \ninstance. This can come from the book’s fundamental choice to limit its territory \nto a period, 1881-2001, which is located out of the pre-Zionist era. It also can \nshow some kind of distance from the standard Zionist historiography where the \npre-Zionist era has a notable place in the overall history of the question; if so, \nsuch distance, as can be seen through the following analysis, is quite limited.\nThe main reference to ancient Israel is made in the opening of Chapter One: \n‘Toward the end of the millennium [the second millennium B.C.] the Hebrews, or \nJews, invaded and settled the land, and for most of the next millennium \nconstituted the majority of the population and governed the bulk of the country. \nThe core of the Jewish state (at one point there were two Jewish kingdoms) \n176 | P a g e\nwas the hill country of Judea, Samaria, and Galilee’(Morris 2001, 4). This \nstatement, although very brief, is powerful and clear enough to register the land \nas a property of the then Jews, considering them the majority of the population, \nwhere they, by establishing the Jewish state, governed the land for ‘most of the \nmillennium’. Although this account does not mention the details of the Zionist \nnarrative it contains the central story, which is the main base for the Jews’ \nhistorical right to the land. No means of distance or academic reservation is \nmade here that might offer the story as a contested claim, or a story that lacks \nenough evidence to be introduced as an historical fact. The second chapter, \nThe Beginning of the Conflict, is started by a quotation that enforces this claim: \n‘Who can challenge the rights of the Jews in Palestine? Good Lord, historically \nit is really your country,\" wrote Jerusalem Muslim dignitary Yusuf Diya al-Khalidi \nto Zadok Kahn, chief rabbi of France, on March 1, 1899’(Morris 2001, 37). \nAnother quotation, this time by a Jew, is offered in the book that has the same \nfunction: ‘Vladimir (Ze'ev) Dubnow, one of the Biluim, wrote to his brother, the \nhistorian Simon Dubnow, in October 1882: \"The ultimate goal... is, in time, to \ntake over the Land of Israel and to restore to the Jews the political \nindependence they have been deprived of for these two thousand years. The \nJews will yet arise and, arms in hand (if need be), declare that they are the \nmasters of their ancient homeland\"(Morris 2001, 49). Such an assertion is \nconfirmed in the ‘Conclusion’ of the book where ‘Palestine’ is introduced as a \nland ‘where the Jews had lived and ruled during the first millennium B.C. (Morris \n2001, 676)’. Somewhere else in the book, Palestinians are blamed for not \nrecognizing this fact: ‘The Palestinians, from the start, never really understood \nthe Zionist claim to the land. They were not aware of or didn't care about the \nJews' roots in the country…(Morris 2001, 679)’. With all this, the book is, \nalmost, free from details provided by the Bible of the ancient Israel; no Jewish \nking, Saul, David or Solomon, is mentioned in the book as such. One mention of \nSolomon is registered with clear distance: ‘But no agreement was reached on \nthe future of the walled Old City and, more particularly, the Temple Mount \n(Haram ash Sharif) area within it, containing the Dome of the Rock and the al\u0002Aqsa Mosque as well as the (presumed) underground remains of King \nSolomon's and Zerubabel's (and Herod's) temples’(Morris 2001, 659). One \nexception, at the same time, is made when Solomon’s ally is mentioned in the \nbook: ‘The four-brigade attack was called Operation Hiram, after the Lebanese \n177 | P a g e\nking of Tyre who had been King Solomon's ally three millennia before’(Morris \n2001, 245).\nIn Chapter One, where the main statement about ancient Israel is made, as \nabove, another Zionist claim, the Jewish expulsion, is passed off as an historical \nfact: ‘The chapter of Jewish sovereignty ended when the Romans invaded and \nthen put down two revolts, in A.D. 66-73 and 132-35, and exiled much of the \nJewish population’(Morris 2001, 4). This assertion is reinforced through remarks \nmade by a French high - ranking official: \n‘On June 4, 1917, the director general of the French Foreign Ministry, \nJules Cambon, issued the declaration that was to serve as a \nprecedent and basis for the more significant Balfour Declaration: You \n[Sokolow]... consider that, circumstances permitting, and the \nindependence of the Holy Places being safeguarded . . . it would be \na deed of justice and of reparation to assist, by the protection of the \nAllied Powers, in the renaissance of the Jewish nationality in that \nland from which the people of Israel were exiled so many centuries \nago’(Morris 2001, 74).\nTaking the main Zionist story of the pre-Zionist era, the next phase of the Zionist \nhistoriography entails the Jewish redemptionist efforts to return to their home \nland. The book, unlike the way it deals with earlier Zionist myths where one \nparagraph, at least, is designed to lend credibility to Zionist historiography, has \nno such statement to articulate the ‘Jewish redemptionist efforts’ which \nconstitute another pillar of the ‘Jewish historical right’ to the land. Another \ntechnique, however, is used here to make such Zionist claims reasonable: \nZionism, being a movement to return to the ‘homeland’, is introduced, \nsomehow, as a movement with old roots in the Jewish tradition: ‘Zionism—the \ndrive for the return of the Jews to, and sovereignty in, Eretz Yisrael—was rooted \nin age-old millenarian impulses and values of Jewish religious \ntradition…’(Morris 2001, 14). Zionism is introduced, in the book, as a \nsecularized version of a Jewish longstanding goal: ‘The mid- and late\u0002nineteenth century saw the rapid secularization of the millenarian-Zionist goal \namid an increasingly secularized Jewish population’(Morris 2001, 14). For this \nreason, the Zionist idea is introduced as ‘completely natural, fine and \n178 | P a g e\njust’(Morris 2001, 37). According to the book, the idea of ‘return’ was the original \ncore of the story, that has been bound to the religious tradition of the past and \nto the secular idea in the modern era, when Zionism arose: \n‘The return to Zion was conceived as a social and political act that \nwould remedy the Jews' abnormal existence as an oppressed \nminority in the Diaspora. But ever since the Jews' exile from the land \nat the start of the first millennium A.D., the idea or vision of a return \nhad been closely bound up with the cosmic, messianic theme of \ncollective redemption and salvation’(Morris 2001, 14). \nDiaspora, in its Zionist meaning, is used in the book, in this regard, without any \ndistance. Jews who joined the Zionist movement to transfer to Palestine, are \ntaken as the same Jews who, supposedly, were expelled from the land 2000 \nyears earlier; a position that represents typical Zionist historiography of the \ncase.\nAnother element of Zionist historiography, as mentioned earlier, is that of \nundermining the Arab history of the land. This long and established history is \ndiscounted through different ways in the book: first of all, there are some \naccounts that exhibit the land as a barren and inhabitable land; Chapter One is \nstarted with a topic on ‘THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE’. The opening of this \nsection is a statement by Mark Twain about the land, in 1867, and its negative \ncharacteristics:\n‘Of all the lands there are for dismal scenery, I think Palestine must \nbe the prince. The hills are barren.... The valleys are unsightly \ndeserts fringed with a feeble vegetation that has an expression about \nit of being sorrowful and despondent.... It is a hopeless, dreary, \nheartbroken land.... Palestine sits in sackcloth and ashes.... Over it \nbroods the spell of a curse that has withered its fields and fettered its \nenergies.... Nazareth is forlorn; ... Jericho... accursed... Jerusalem... \na pauper village.... Palestine is desolate and unlovely’(Morris 2001, \n3). \n179 | P a g e\nThis statement is placed at some distance, by the book: ‘He may have been \nindulging in hyperbole, but then neither was Palestine, in the mid-nineteenth \ncentury, the \"land of milk and honey\" promised in the Bible’(Morris 2001, 3). \nLater in this chapter, when the book describes Palestine before the rise of \nZionism, Morris uses many statements to portray such an image of the land: \n‘Through the nineteenth century the population was plagued by diseases such \nas malaria, trachoma, dysentery, cholera, and typhoid fever. Water supplies \nwere inadequate and frequently impure’(Morris 2001, 6). A number of elements \nsuch as drought, Ottoman high taxation, Bedouin banding, and health hazards \nare suggested to picture Palestine as an ‘insecure and poor’ land that was \ninhabited by a weak and primitive society: ‘Agriculture was primitive, with little \nirrigation’(Morris 2001, 5). The picture provided in the book, is not that radical, \nto support, blindly the idea of ‘the land without people’ but it, of course, \nsympathises with that. The book, in fact, refers to some positive points of 19th \ncentury Palestine. More importantly, it considers, in Chapter 2, this idea held by \nthe first Zionist settlers about Palestine as a misconception; \n‘Many First Aliyah immigrants believed that they were coming to a \ndesolate, empty land and were surprised to find so many Arabs \nabout. After all, they were returning to their Promised Land; no one \nhad spoken of anyone else being there. There is one testimony by \nYosef Chaim Brenner, the Second Aliyah's leading novelist, saying, \nin this regard: \"Before going to Palestine, the country, for some \nreason, appeared in my imagination as one city inhabited by non\u0002religious Jews surrounded by many fields, all empty, empty, empty, \nwaiting for more people to come and cultivate them\"(Morris 2001, \n42).\nAnother testimony is used later in the book to describe the same situation: \n‘Ahad Ha'Am, the leading Eastern European Jewish essayist, \nopened many Jewish eyes when he wrote, in 1891, after a three\u0002month visit to Palestine: \"We abroad are used to believing that Eretz \nYisrael is now almost totally desolate, a desert that is not sowed but \nin truth this is not the case. Throughout the country it is difficult to find \n180 | P a g e\nfields that are not sowed. Only sand dunes and stony mountains . . . \nare not cultivated\"(Morris 2001, 42).\nIn relation to the Arab history of the land where Arab Palestinians dominated the \nland for centuries, if not millennia, and formed its population and society, the \nbook has no statement to articulate that. On the contrary, it uses a different \nhistoriography to discount this history, considering Arabs as only one of many \npeople who controlled the land after the supposed Jewish expulsion: ‘After \nsuccessive invasions and counter invasions by Persians, Arabs, Turks, \nCrusaders, Mongols, Mamelukes, and (again) Turks, the country—at the \nbeginning of the nineteenth century, under imperial Ottoman rule—had a \npopulation of about 275,000 to 300,000 people, of whom 90 percent were \nMuslim Arabs, 7,000 to 10,000 Jews, and 20,000 to 30,000 Christian \nArabs’(Morris 2001, 4).\nThe book acknowledges the Arab population, as an overwhelming majority, in \nPalestine, as stated in the above - mentioned quotation from the book. This fact, \nhowever, does not make the Zionist historiography register the land as having a\nPalestinian majority. The Zionist historiography, as mentioned earlier, borrows \nthe Western idea of nationalism to claim this oriental land populated by \nPalestinians, who form every aspect of this Arab society. This borrowing allows \nthe cancellation of a Palestinian right to govern the land of their own simply \nbecause they, unlike Jewish people, had no qualification to form a nation: \n‘Yet, despite the indisputable presence of Arab communities in most \nareas of the country, the Jews, down to the 1920s, were right on one \nlevel: They themselves were the only \"nation\" or \"people\" in the \ncountry: The Arabs simply did not exist as a Palestinian people—as \nanother, competing nationalism. The small minority of politically \nconscious Arabs saw themselves as part of the wider \"Arab nation\" \nor of the \"Greater Syria\" polity’(Morris 2001, 678).\nPalestinian nationalism, the book asserts, emerged some time later, and mainly \nas a response to the Jewish nationalist movement: ‘It was at this time [World \nWar I and its aftermath], too, that a distinct Palestinian local patriotism or proto\u0002nationalism began to emerge. This tendency or orientation—it hardly qualified \n181 | P a g e\nas a movement—gradually groped its way forward, largely in reaction to the \nburgeoning Zionist presence’(Morris 2001, 34). This ‘first come first take’ game, \nthat introduces the Palestinians as being too late to form a nation is introduced \nas the main reason why Jews occupy the country: ‘Zionism emerged about a \nquarter of a century earlier than Arab nationalism, a head start in political \nconsciousness and organization that proved vital to the Jews' success and to \nthe Palestinian Arabs' failure during the following decades of conflict’(Morris \n2001, 26). The context of the Jewish right to the land is simple and \nstraightforward in this historiography; the colonial domination of the Ottoman \nEmpire collapsed in World War 1. In other parts of this colony nationalist \nmovements established their own countries. The process in Palestine \nencountered a specific problem where two nationalist movements emerged to \nfill the gap produced by Ottoman withdrawal; Jews, one of the two, succeeded \nbecause they were earlier to take the chance: \n‘The Ottoman Empire was no more. In the lands south of Turkey \nthere emerged over the years, under French and British tutelage, the \nstates of the Arabian Peninsula, Syria, Lebanon, Transjordan (from \n1948 Jordan), and Iraq. And there emerged the problem of Palestine, \nwhere, under the umbrella of the British Mandate, two national \nmovements, Arab and Jewish, vied for dominance and, eventually, \nstatehood’(Morris 2001, 32).\nThe last point about the Morris historiography of pre-Zionist history is that of \nhow he treats Islam as a main contributor to the conflict; unlike many other \nhistoriographies, even Zionist ones, which consider the Christian/European \ntreatment of the Jews as a main reason for the rise of Zionism, and for what \nhappened subsequently in Israel/Palestine, the book highlights the role of Islam \nin these happenings; Islam, first of all, is introduced as an anti-Jewish religion: \n‘The Koran is full of anti-Jewish asides and references’(Morris 2001, 9). Islam is \nseen in this historiography as a religion with a fundamental problem about \nJudaism: ‘From the beginning, Islam suffered from the natural jealousy of a \nsuccessor or \"child\" toward the monotheistic parent religions from which it \nsprang, Judaism and Christianity’(Morris 2001, 9). The hostile attitude to \nJudaism, according to the book, is codified in Islamic regulations since the \n182 | P a g e\nbeginning: ‘Muhammad's relations with the Jews, and subsequent Koranic \nattitudes, were eventually embodied in the treaty of submission to Muslim rule, \nor writ of protection, known as the dhimma, or Pact of 'Umar, extended by \nMuhammad's successor, the second caliph, 'Umar 'ibn al-Khattab (634-\n44)’(Morris 2001, 9). Against all the facts about how Islam treated others, \nChristians and Jews, far better than other powerful religions treated minority \nfaiths, it is introduced as a religion with deep xenophobia: ‘The principle of \nequality—between believer and nonbeliever as between man and woman—is \nalien to Islam, and the Islamic world, normally in conflict with Dar al Harb in one \nregion or another, has traditionally exhibited a deep xenophobia’(Morris 2001, \n8–9). In this endeavour the historical fact, that the equality between believer and \nnon-believer, and between women and men, did not exist in that historical \nenvironment, and the fact that this perception of equality comes from modern \nideas that managed to govern human societies very recently, is ignored. Islam’s \n‘evil’ treatment of the Jews is introduced right in the opening of the section on \n‘Islam and the Jews’: ‘Islam generally, and the Ottoman Empire in particular, \ntreated the Jews in its midst as second-class citizens’(Morris 2001, 8). The \ngolden time the Jews experienced under Islam would bring no credit, according \nto the book, to Islam: ‘During the Islamic High Middle Ages, c. A.D. 850 - 1250, \nJudaism and the Jews had flourished, and would later designate the period a \n\"golden era\" of Jewish history’(Morris 2001, 8). But their occasional (presumed) \npoverty under Islam is regarded as a ‘result of discriminatory practices’: ‘Other \nrestrictions had nothing to do with security and everything to do with religious \nand economic discrimination, and Jewish poverty in most of the Ottoman lands \nin the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries appears to have been, in some \nmeasure at least, the result of discriminatory practices’(Morris 2001, 10). \nAfter making those general statements about Islam’s treatment of Jews, that is \ncharacteristic of this textbook, the longest list ever (as far as I have explored in \nIsrael/Palestine histories) of Islam’s crimes against Jews is delivered. In this \nhistoriography the whole history of Islam as a religion which tolerated Jews \nbetter than other religions, and the fact of the Islamic world being a refuge for \nJews during the long Islamic history is granted no value or relevance: \n‘Nevertheless, in general the Jews under Islam seem to have fared better than \nthe Christians—if only because the former, usually poor, often abject, always \n183 | P a g e\npowerless, were a threat to no one’(Morris 2001, 10). The well-established \nIslamic tolerance of Jews is undermined repeatedly in the book; ‘Contemptuous \ntolerance,\" in the phrase of historian Elie Kedourie, came to be the attitude \nadopted by Muslim states toward their Jewish communities. This stance was \ngenerally mixed with a measure of hostility, especially in times of political crisis. \nTolerance was then superseded by intolerance, which occasionally erupted into \nviolence. Throughout, Muslims treated the dhimmi, and perhaps especially the \nJews, as impure’(Morris 2001, 9–10). Against all the evidence of Islamic \ntolerance of Jews in history, the underlying attitude of Islam is introduced in line \nwith the writer’s pessimistic style: ‘But the underlying attitude, that Jews were \ninfidels and opponents of Islam, and necessarily inferior in the eyes of God, \nprevailed throughout Muslim lands down the ages’(Morris 2001, 11). In this way \nthe history of Jews in Islam, according to the book, has a foreseeable summary: \n‘throughout they [the Jews] suffered discrimination, humiliation, and a sense of \ninsecurity. Occasionally they were subjected to persecution and violence’(Morris\n2001, 8).\nThis Islamic position toward the Jews has influenced, according to the book, the \nIsrael/Palestine question: \n‘The history and tradition of Muslim attitudes and behavior toward the \nJews was to affect profoundly the unfolding of Turkish-Zionist and \nArab-Zionist relations in Palestine. The view of the Jews as objects, \nunassertive and subservient, was to underlie to some degree both \nthe initial weak, irresolute Ottoman and Arab responses to the \ngradual Zionist influx into Palestine—Why bother, the Jews could \nachieve nothing anyway!—and the eventual aggressive reactions, \nincluding vandalism and murder—the Jews were accursed of God \nand meant only harm; their lives and property were therefore \nforfeit’(Morris 2001, 13). \nThe book here is reporting the history of the Arabs’ treatment of Jews in modern \nPalestine, which entails both soft and hard reactions; the soft treatment of the \nimmigrant Jews before the Balfour Declaration, and the hard reaction of the \nPalestinians when they encountered the Jewish claim to their land. The book \ndoes not record any credit to Muslims for being that soft to Jews. It is taken, \n184 | P a g e\nastonishingly, as evidence to regard Muslims as anti-Jewish. In this way,\nhowever Muslims treated Jews, soft or hard, both prove their anti-Jewish \nposition(Morris 2001, 13). Islam, according to the book, is not only responsible \nfor the aggressiveness shown by Muslims in the conflict, but also for the \naggressiveness committed on the Jewish side: ‘Muslim attitudes to some \ndegree affected the Zionist colonists in Palestine. They drove the colonists, at \nleast during the early decades of Zionism, toward occasional over -\nassertiveness and even aggressiveness in an effort to wipe out the traces of \ntheir traditional, and for them humiliating, image’(Morris 2001, 13). Later in the \nbook Islam, again, is introduced as a main source of the Arab-Israeli conflict: \n‘Islam posited the inalienability of land conquered by Muslims. Such tracts \nbecame automatically part of the divinely sanctioned Dar al Islam’(Morris 2001, \n39). This statement of the book is explaining why Arabs resist the establishment \nof a Jewish state in Palestine, no matter whose land this is.\nSummary of the Analysis\nAs the above analysis demonstrates, the book, although different from the \nclassic Zionist histories, can pass off all the main elements of the Zionist \nmythology of the pre-Zionist era as historical facts. The biblical stories of \nancient Israel are not acknowledged but what Zionist historiography tries to \npass off, by numerous names, dates and events taken from the Bible, is \naccepted, in a wholesale fashion, without bothering to prove Solomon’s power , \nfor instance, or locating his palace. Exile of Jews, as another element of the \nZionist historiography, is confirmed as a historical fact on several occasions in \nthe book. Zionism is described, by the writer, not as a recent European \nphenomenon, but as a modern version of Jewish longstanding tradition to return \nto their homeland. It is also introduced as a genuine national movement that \nemerged in Palestine when it was free from a nationalistic character. The long \nArab history of the land is discounted in an exceptional way; Arabs are placed \nbeside others, like Persians and Mongols who invaded the land and controlled it \nfor a while. This has been reinforced by introducing Islam and Islamic history as \na main factor that contributed to creating the conflict between Arabs and Jews \nin Palestine. Furthermore, no traces of any analytical doubt or academic \n185 | P a g e\nscepticism that might challenge these contested, if not fake, claims are located \nin the book.\n186 | P a g e\nAnalysis of the Fourth Textbook:\nThe book, A History of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict, is written by Mark A. \nTessler, Professor of Political Science at the University of Michigan. The book \nwas first published in 1994 in the USA. The second edition of the book is \npublished, under the Indiana series in Middle East Studies, in 2009 by Indiana \nUniversity Press. Comprising 1018 pages, the book is a long volume that deals \nwith all phases of the history of the question, but it is more detailed on the \nevents of 1948 and afterwards. The book’s contents are organized in six distinct \nparts, the last one on the Palestinian Intifada and the Oslo Peace Process. \nSome portions of the book’s second edition, only those that might be relevant to \nthe analysis in this study, are examined for the sake of this research, including \nthe following ones:\n Preface to the Second Edition\n Preface\n Part I: Jews and Arabs Before the Conflict: The Congruent Origins of \nModern Zionism and Arab Nationalism\n Part II: Emergence and History of the Conflict to 1948\nThe Index is used, in the final phase, to explore any relevant content that might \nbe unnoticed through the earlier stages of the examination. The survey \nconducted for the sake of this thesis demonstrates that the book is taken as a \ntextbook in many courses related to the history of the question but this is not the \ncase in all 6 countries of the survey. It is adopted in only 3 countries of the \nsurvey; the US (61 syllabi), the UK (19) and Canada (13). But the figure coming \nfrom the total number of adoptions (in related courses) proposes it as the fourth \nmost adopted textbook, having been adopted, altogether, in 93 academic \ncourses. The figure cited for the book in Google Scholar, 356, demonstrates, \nalso, its position as a main reference for other scholarly works. \nThe book, in its Preface, and also, in the Preface to the second edition, reveals \nsome significant points about the perspective adopted in it from which to view \nthe history of the question; it stresses first the book’s robust scientific \norientation. The loyalty to the relevant principles of objectivity, accuracy, and \nnon-partisanship is made clear in several statements: ‘…my aim has been to \nmaintain a stance of considered objectivity. I have tried to represent both sides \n187 | P a g e\nfairly when fundamental issues are discussed’(Tessler 2009, xvii). The book is \nintroduced, in this regard, as a work that does not advocate a specific \nconclusion; ‘My goal is not to foster specific conclusions about central issues in \nthe conflict but to provide a basis for understanding and evaluating the actions \nof both Israelis and Palestinians’(Tessler 2009, xvii). The book’s main mission is \ndescribed as providing the arguments of both sides leaving the conclusion to \nthe reader: ‘… the volume strives for a nonpartisan point of view; it seeks to \npresent both Palestinian and Israeli analyses and to enable readers to form \ntheir own conclusions about the persuasiveness of competing \narguments’(Tessler 2009, xvii). \nThis book might seem to create some critical distance from its stated position, \nfirst, when it advocates ‘an engaged and sympathetic understanding of the \nparties to the conflict’, a particular approach that is described by the book as \n‘objectivity without detachment’(Tessler 2009, viii). Objectivity, accuracy or any \nother truth - oriented value might be undermined when providing sympathy with \nthe parties (of the conflict) is a priority. This book’s position also might pave the \nway for a historiographical strategy which is referred to in the relevant literature \nas ‘equal claims’. This strategy of rejecting all conclusions for the sake of one, \nclaim equality, might fall in contradiction with the stated aim of this history i.e. \nobjectivity; it also has the power to regulate the history of the question in a \ncertain way, and might suppress the objectivity and other truth - oriented \nobjectives when they do not provide such a conclusion. The equality claim is \narticulated, more evidently, somewhere else in the book, when it is introduced, \nalso, as a fact rooted in the history: ‘The present study rejects these tendencies \nand offers a different approach. It assumes that both Israeli Jews and \nPalestinian Arabs have legitimate and inalienable rights. These rights are rooted \nin the historical experience of each people’(Tessler 2009, xiv). The ‘equal claim’ \nprinciple is taken further when both sides are entitled to the same sum of \nrespect or condemnation: ‘Consistent with this approach, the book presupposes \nthat the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is not a struggle between good and evil but \nrather a confrontation between two peoples who deserve recognition and \nrespect, neither of whom has a monopoly on behavior that is either \npraiseworthy or condemnable’(Tessler 2009, xiv–xv). This position is described \nin the book as ‘approach – approach perspective’(Tessler 2009, xv). It is \n188 | P a g e\nrevealed in the book, however, that this perspective is taken, partly, for practical \npurposes: ‘This approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is advocated not only \nin the name of objectivity and historical accuracy but with a conviction that there \nis practical value to what might be called an “approach-approach” \nperspective’(Tessler 2009, xv). \nIn this line, the book, being a history of the Israel/Palestine question, is free to \nexhibit its eagerness to provide some sort of middle way solution to the \nquestion. The partition is introduced as the legitimate solution to the question, \nconsistent with the equal claim strategy. The powerful enthusiasm of the book \nfor such a solution might make it vulnerable in recognizing the conflicting \nobjectives of Zionism and Palestinian aspirations: ‘It demonstrates what an \naccurate reading of history shows to have been the case all along, that there is \nnothing about the essence of Zionism or of Palestinian nationalism that makes it \nimpossible even to conceive of a solution to the conflict’(Tessler 2009, xviii). \nThe preferred solution is supported wholeheartedly in another statement, \nflavoured by some offensive positions against those who oppose such a \nsolution: ‘The principles of territorial compromise and mutual recognition appear \nto be supported by a majority on both sides of the conflict. To be sure, on both \nsides there are also hard-liners and rejectionists, those who for ideological \nreasons oppose territorial compromise and recognition of their longstanding \nadversary’(Tessler 2009, xviii). The book displays its highest point of \nperspectival confidence when, against numerous facts on the ground, and all \nthe facts about the contradictory ends of the opposing parties of the conflict, it \nconsiders ‘psychology’ as the main essence of the conflict: \n‘I thus remain convinced that one of the biggest obstacles to peace, \nand arguably the biggest obstacle of all, is psychological in character. \nPeace will be possible if, and almost certainly only if, each side and \nits supporters reject the view that the Israeli – Palestinian conflict is a \nstruggle between good and evil, accept the legitimacy of the other \nside’s aspirations, and conclude from the history reported in this book \nthat neither party has a monopoly on behaviour that is deserving \neither of respect or of condemnation’(Tessler 2009, ix).\n189 | P a g e\nAnalysis: the main body of the book starts with a section on ‘Jews and Arabs \nbefore the Conflict’. Two key reasons are offered for providing this survey. The \nfirst one is a non-Zionist one; ‘There are several reasons to begin a study of the \nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict with a general survey of Jewish and Arab history. \nOne is to dispel the common misconception that the current struggle in \nPalestine is an extension of an ancient blood feud, fueled by ethnic or religious \nantagonisms dating back hundreds of years. This view is not only inaccurate, \n…’(Tessler 2009, 1). The book stresses, in this section, the fact that Arab \nhostility towards the Jews is a post- Zionism phenomenon; ‘Present-day issues \nmust be approached with a recognition that neither the Arab-Israeli dispute in \ngeneral nor the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in particular is based on or driven \nforward by primordial antagonisms, and that it has in fact been less than a \ncentury since Jews and Arabs began to view one another as enemies’(Tessler \n2009, 1). The typical Zionist historians, in contrast, try, often, to distance \nZionism from the mess it created in Arab-Jew relations.\nThe second one is rather different; it is based on a contention that there is a \nsubstantial symmetry between Arab and Jewish histories: ‘There is also a \nremarkable congruence between Jewish and Arab history, and herein resides \nyet another reason to examine the experience of each people prior to the \nconflict in Palestine. Indeed, this may be the most important reason of all in the \nlong run’(Tessler 2009, 2). This argument can work, when developed in certain \nways, to advocate claim equality. There are several instances of such \nfunctioning in the book. The following is one: ‘Thus, during their respective \nclassical periods, Jews and Arabs both possessed the elements of peoplehood \nand transformed themselves into viable political kingdoms, with the members of \neach polity united by respect for an authoritative legal system and by shared \nbonds of religion, culture, and civilization’(Tessler 2009, 3).\nThe textbook is relatively detailed when treating Jewish ancient history; almost \nall different chapters of Jewish ancient triumph, according to the Biblical stories, \nare offered as a true history of the land. This history starts with the first chapter \nwhen Moses, supposedly, led his people to the Holy Land: \n‘Biblical record and archaeological evidence indicate that the Jews \nconquered and began to settle the land of Canaan during the \n190 | P a g e\nthirteenth century before the Christian era (B.C.E.). Moses had given \nthe Israelites political organization and led them out of Egypt, \nbringing them to the borders of the Promised Land. Then, under \nJoshua, they initiated a prolonged military campaign in which they \ngradually took control of the territory and made it their home’(Tessler \n2009, 8). \nThe book, here and later, tends to rely on the Bible as a source of factual \nhistory. There are a few cases of creating some distance from the biblical \nstories but the book, as a whole, remains very close to the position known as \nmaximalist where the Bible is regarded as a source of factual truth about \nhistory. The first instance of such a distance came just after the above -\nmentioned statement: \n‘Most contemporary scholars believe that it took the Jews many \ndecades to establish hegemony over Eretz Yisrael, and that even \nafter it was secured and occupied, Canaanite enclaves remained for \nsome time. Despite accounts in the Book of Joshua which suggest \nthat the land was conquered in a single campaign, planned in \nadvance by Moses and later Joshua, other Biblical testimony is \nconsistent with those archaeological indications suggesting a \nstruggle that lasted as much as a century’(Tessler 2009, 8). \nAs can be seen here, this seeming distance from the Bible also depends on \nother Biblical accounts in order to be proved true. Generally speaking, the \nlanguage of the book is quite confident about what happened thousands of \nyears ago in ancient Israel: ‘In any event, by the twelfth century B.C.E., the \nperiod of Judges, the Jews were firmly established in ancient Palestine, and the \narea of their control included substantial tracts of territory on both sides of the \nJordan River’(Tessler 2009, 8). This confidence allows the book to provide a \ndetailed map (map i.i) of the territories controlled by the Jews at that time. The \nbook’s history continues with later developments of Jewish ancient \naccomplishments; ‘The Israelite political community developed steadily, marked \nby the growth of national consciousness and the emergence of national \ninstitutions and reaching its apogee during the period of monarchical rule under \nDavid and Solomon’(Tessler 2009, 8). David and Solomon are taken as true \n191 | P a g e\nhistorical figures in the book, and their religious stories are presented as \nhistorical facts; \n‘David, who ruled until 960 B.C.E., greatly expanded and \nstrengthened the Israelite kingdom. He had initially established his \ncapital in Hebron, in the region of his own tribe, Judah, but within a \nfew years he captured Jerusalem from the Jebusites and made it the \ncenter of his growing empire. Soon the kingdom of the Jews \nstretched from the Red Sea in the south to what is today the \nsouthern part of Lebanon, and from the Mediterranean Sea in the \neast across the Jordan River to Ammon and Moab’(Tessler 2009, 9–\n10). \nAs in this case, the book is quite assertive about its knowledge of ancient time \nproviding the exact time, place and even details of ancient developments \nincluding, for instance, girls who come from the ruling families in Solomon’s \ntime; ‘sealing some of them through marriage to women from the ruling families \nof foreign states’(Tessler 2009, 10). It is noteworthy that nothing is found in the \nbook that constitutes some kind of scientific distance concerning such stories, \nor giving some awareness that this might not represent what really happened \nthat far in the past. The reader/student has the right to take these religious \nstories as historical facts if he relies on the book for the question’s history. The \nJewish ancient achievements continue, according to the book, in Solomon’s \ntime: \n‘The kingdom continued to develop and remained united through the \nreign of Solomon, David’s son, who presided over a period of \ncomparative peace and governed the country until 930 B.C.E. \nSolomon’s accomplishments included construction of the royal \ncomplex in Jerusalem, consisting of the palace and the Temple; \nexpansion and fortification of many other cities; and creation of an \nintegrated political system for governing the country’s twelve \nadministrative districts’(Tessler 2009, 10). \nTill now, and before the conquest of ancient Israel by its neighbours, the book \nadds ‘several centuries of independence’ to the Zionist historiographical \n192 | P a g e\naccount. Confirming this ‘fact’ the book provides more ‘precise’ details of Jewish \nindependence when describing the Babylonian invasion: ‘for the first time in \nmore than four hundred years the ancient Middle East was without an \nindependent Hebrew state’(Tessler 2009, 11).\nIn line with providing the ‘precise’ details of ancient historical developments, the \nbook has no scientific reservation about use of specific figures; 42,000, for \ninstance, as the number of exiled Jews who were ‘repatriated in an initial wave \nof immigration’ to return to Palestine after Cyrus dealt with Babylon(Tessler \n2009, 11). A firm date is, also, offered for construction of the supposed second \ntemple; ‘the Temple in Jerusalem was rebuilt between 520 and 515 B.C.E.’ \n(Tessler 2009, 11). The book is articulate in re-establishing Jewish \nindependence by providing more ‘facts’ on ancient Israel. The first phase \noccurred at the time of Cyrus: ‘Judea was granted the status of a semi\u0002independent territory, with Jerusalem its capital and the laws of the Holy Torah \nits constitution, and Jewish leaders were permitted to exercise authority over all \nthe inhabitants of Judea’(Tessler 2009, 12). This semi-independent condition \nwas followed by a later full-fledged independence, according to the book: ‘in \n142 B.C.E. the Seleucid king, Demitrius II, also recognized the independence of \nJudea. Thus was established the Second Jewish Commonwealth in \nPalestine’(Tessler 2009, 12). This supposed independence, according to the \nbook, expands to cover all the lands conquered earlier by David and Solomon: \n‘The kingdom also grew stronger under the Hasmoneans, so that, with the \ngrowing disintegration of the Seleucid Empire, it was able to recapture Samaria \nand other parts of Eretz Yisrael lying outside Judea. At its zenith, it controlled \nalmost as much territory as had the kingdom of David and Solomon more than \neight centuries earlier’(Tessler 2009, 12). The Zionist image of the land is \ncompleted here when the Romans’ intervention is introduced as the main \nreason responsible for interrupting ‘the ancient Jewish independence’.\nThe second part of the Zionist mythology, the forced expulsion of the Jews from \nPalestine, is represented as a historical fact on numerous occasions in the book \nbut in contrast with the history provided on ancient Israel, it is not detailed. No \nseparate paragraph explores, in fact, this part of Zionist historiography. The \nbook’s treatment of the question is quite brief: ‘Further, the movement of the \n193 | P a g e\nJews into a period of exile and dispersion was sealed by the tragic \nconsequences of revolts initiated by Bar Kochba and others in the second \ncentury’(Tessler 2009, 13). Other references to the Jewish expulsion are made \nwhen other subjects are under scrutiny: ‘… even after the people of Israel had \nbeen driven into exile and dispersed’(Tessler 2009, 7). \nThe next part of the Zionist mythology entails the Diaspora time when, \naccording to Zionist historiography, Jews continued to consider Palestine their \nhomeland, kept the hope to return to it, and made redemptionist efforts to \nrealize that hope. The book has a lot in common with this Zionist historiography. \nThe biggest service it might make to supporting Zionist history of this time is the \ninnovative construction of Zionism as a genuine Jewish movement that lasted \nthe whole era of the diaspora, first in the form of classical/traditional Zionism \nand then through the fashion of modern Zionism. In this way, Zionism is \nintroduced as a Jewish movement that arose right after the ‘Jewish expulsion’, \nand was sustained until modern times when it experienced a transformation into \na modern form: \n‘Following destruction of the Second Jewish Commonwealth in \nPalestine and dispersion of the Jewish people, Jews reaffirmed their \nchosenness and continued to think of themselves as a political \ncommunity. Moreover, these notions came together in the form of \nZionism, not modern political Zionism but rather classical or \ntraditional religious Zionism, in which Jews expressed their belief that \nGod would in the future bring about an ingathering of the exiles and \nrestore the children of Israel to the Promised Land’(Tessler 2009, \n16).\nThe constructed concept of classical Zionism has the capacity to carry the main \nelements of the Zionist historiography of this era: \n‘Classical Zionism proclaimed the Jews’ continuing and unbreakable \ntie to Palestine, to the territory they regarded as Eretz Yisrael. \nAccording to one scholar, “Despite the loss of political independence \nand the dispersion of the Jewish people, the true home of the Jews \nremained Jerusalem and the Land of Israel; the idea of eventual \n194 | P a g e\nreturn from the four corners of the earth was never abandoned”. \nMoreover, the notions of return and an ingathering of the exiles were \nvisible and salient within the lives of Diaspora Jews. As summarized \nby one present-day analyst, perhaps with slight hyperbole, “Most \naspects of Jewish life in the Diaspora were intimately linked with \nPalestine. Jewish rabbinical law favored the settler in the ancient \nhomeland. Religious literature echoed with such sayings as: “It is \nbetter to dwell in the deserts of Palestine than in palaces abroad,” \n“Whoever lives in Palestine lives sinless,” and “The air of Palestine \nmakes one wise.” There was no distinction between the spiritual and \nthe physical Palestine in the minds of most Jews. Although separated \nfrom the Holy Land by thousands of miles, to most it seemed closer \nthan the neighboring Christian communities, which were regarded \nwith hostility and fear”(Tessler 2009, 16). \nThere are other statements constructed or quoted by the book to support such \nZionist ideas; ‘Jews further expressed their faith in a return to the Holy Land on \nmany ceremonial occasions’(Tessler 2009, 19). The book acknowledges the \nreligious and messianic properties of classical Zionism: ‘Also central to classical \nZionism is the notion of the coming of the Messiah, an event that the faithful \nbelieve will bring with it the millennium and be the occasion for the restoration of \nJewish national independence in the Holy Land’(Tessler 2009, 16). Meanwhile, \nMessianic beliefs, being part of the Jewish religious tradition, are taken as\nevidence to support the existence of diaspora everlasting Zionism; \n‘As expressed by Silver, three factors underlie the Messianic beliefs \nof the Jewish people: “the loss of national independence and the \nattendant deprivations, the will to live dominantly and triumphantly as \na rehabilitated people in its national home, and the unfaltering faith in \ndivine justice by whose eternal canons the national restoration was \ninfallibly prescribed.” These are the dominant and recurring themes \nof classical Zionism and the elements from which its political \nsignificance is derived. They include a lamentation of the Jewish \npeople’s exile from Palestine and subsequent dispersion, an \naffirmation that the Jewish nation’s unity of purpose and tie to the \n195 | P a g e\nHoly Land nonetheless remains and cannot be destroyed, and a \nprofession of the Jews’ unshakable faith that a restoration of their \nkingdom in Eretz Yisrael is part of God’s plan and will accompany the \narrival of Messiah’(Tessler 2009, 19). \nIn this line, not only the messianic religious message is distorted as shown \nabove, into a political and national manifestation but messianic practices are \nalso taken in a way that supports the Zionist idea: \n‘Although Messianic activity of this sort (those related to the coming \nof Messiah) was episodic, and usually confined to the more pious or \neven mystic elements of the Jewish community, other manifestations \nof traditional Zionist conceptions were much more routinized and \nwidespread. Practicing Jews prayed daily for the time when the world \nwould be delivered from evil and the people of Israel would be \nreturned to Jerusalem’(Tessler 2009, 18).\nThe book creates some distance, however, between itself and Zionist \nhistoriography, in this regard, when recognizing that traditional Zionism is \ninspired by Jewish messianic beliefs, and does not entail any actual call to \nreturn to Palestine; it confirms, indeed, the opposite: \n‘While this constellation of beliefs continued to shape Jewish identity and \nthought into the modem era, Jews for the most part considered themselves \npassive before God. Indeed, this element of passivity, or patient anticipation, is \nalso central to the definition of classical Zionism. Their sense of community and \nemotional attachment to Eretz Yisrael remained intense, but most Jews \nnonetheless did not believe it was appropriate to initiate steps toward the \nreconstruction of their national home in Palestine. On the contrary, such action \nwould indicate a loss of faith and the absence of a willingness to wait for the \ncreator's plan to unfold in its own divinely ordained fashion, and this, as a \nconsequence, would rupture the covenant between God and the Jewish people \nand make illogical and illegitimate any proclamation of Jewish nationhood or \nany assertion of a continuing tie between Diaspora Jewry and the land of \nIsrael’(Tessler 2009, 19–20). \n196 | P a g e\nThe distance becomes wider when the book admits that nothing notable \nhappened to signify a redemptionist effort by Jews to return to Palestine; \n‘It is for this reason, notes a prominent Israeli scholar, that the Jews' \nlink to Palestine, for all its emotional and religious ardor, “did not \nchange the praxis of Jewish life in the Diaspora … the belief in the \nreturn to Zion never disappeared, but the historical record shows that \non the whole Jews did not relate to the vision of the return in a more \nactive way than most Christians viewed the second coming.” These \nclassical Zionist conceptions provided little motivation for a Jewish \nreturn to Palestine. As explained, quite the opposite was in fact the \ncase; it would have been heretical for Jews to arrogate onto \nthemselves the work of God, to believe that they need not await the \nunfolding of the divine plan but rather could take into their own hands \nthe fulfilment of a destiny for which they considered themselves \nchosen by the creator. Thus, although there was an unbroken Jewish \npresence in Palestine from the destruction of the second \ncommonwealth until the modern era, and while there were also \nperiods of renaissance among the Jews there, during the early years \nof Ottoman rule in the sixteenth century, for example, the number of \nJews residing in the Holy Land after the second century never \nconstituted more than a small proportion either of the country's \noverall population or of world Jewry. Similarly, although small \nnumbers of Jews travelled to Palestine from the Diaspora throughout \nthe ages, sometimes making visits and sometimes going to settle, \nmost sought only personal spiritual fulfilment and had no thought of \ncontributing to the realization of political or nationalist objectives. At \nthe dawning of the modern age in the latter half of the eighteenth \ncentury, only 5000 or so of the estimated 2.5 to 3 million Jews in the \nworld resided in Palestine,…(Tessler 2009, 20)’ \nThis statement might constitute the most non-Zionist statement in the book (of \npre Zionism history) where the book rejects the Zionist claim that diaspora \nhistory witnessed continuous Jewish attempts to return to Palestine, introducing \n197 | P a g e\nZionism as the last and the only successful one. The book, however, stresses \nmessianic Zionism as a source to support Jewish nationhood:\n‘As the preceding makes clear, traditional religious Zionism is \ninextricably bound up with the Jews’ definition of themselves as a \nnation. The Messianic idea expresses and brings together the \npolitical, religious, and spiritual destiny of the Jewish people, making \nthe bonds of their peoplehood not only a shared recollection of their \nDivinely guided history as a nation in Palestine and the sociological \ncontent of the law they struggle to observe in their communities \nscattered throughout the Diaspora, but also a firmly held conviction \nthat they will be gathered together in the future and thus united as \nthey were in the past’(Tessler 2009, 19).\nThe book’s position on Jewish nationhood might represent one of most pro\u0002Zionist aspects of the book, where it supports, fully, the Zionist historiographical \nclaim of considering the religious community of Jews as a nation. There is a \nclear emphasis on this in the section on ‘Jewish History and the Emergence of \nModern Political Zionism’;\n‘It is inadequate to describe the Jews as a religious group in the \nmodern-day sense of the term. Like Muslims, they are more \nappropriately regarded as a national community of believers. The \nJews’ sense of peoplehood is extremely well developed, inextricably \nbound up with their collective historical experience, with the Land of \nIsrael where they built their ancient kingdoms, and with the \nsociological and political content of their law’(Tessler 2009, 7). \nThis is taken a bit further in another statement in this section in the book: \n‘Therefore, again, the Jews are more than a religious group. They are also a \nhistorically legitimated political community possessing many of the attributes \nassociated with nationhood’(Tessler 2009, 8). The book emphasises, \nexclusively, Jewish religious law as a source that entitles Jews to the status of a \nnation: ‘Interwoven with this experience in nationhood and these ties to the land \nof Palestine is the role of Jewish law in defining the peoplehood of the \nJews’(Tessler 2009, 13). The book appears eager, in another statement, to use \n198 | P a g e\nall available sources to justify Jewish nationhood, raising its claim to the point \nwhere Jews can be perceived as the first nation in history: \n‘Thus, coupled with their historical experience in Eretz Yisrael, the \nlaw of the Torah and the Talmud makes the Jews a people, indeed a \nnation, rather than a religious group. The concatenation of these \ncommunal bonds produces a solidarity that is akin to nationalism, \neven though it is legitimized by an understanding of Divine as well as \nnatural and historical right. As expressed in the context of the \nmodern-day world by Moses Hess, a mid-nineteenth-century Zionist \nthinker, this communal solidarity has made the Jews from the \nbeginning of their history a nation in the modern sense—indeed the \nfirst such nation’(Tessler 2009, 15–16).\nIt should be mentioned, at the same time, that the book does not use racial \nreasoning to support the Zionist claim of Jewish peoplehood. A thorough search \nin the book demonstrates that the holy land has not been introduced as the \nancestral land of the Jewish people. In contrast, it has been introduced in \nseveral cases, on page 72, 73, 402, 433, and 439, as the ancestral land of the\nPalestinians.\nThe book’s treatment of the Arab history of the land is, relatively, far from the \nZionist historiography in several ways. It does confirm the ancient roots of the \nPalestinian people in Palestine; ‘The Palestinians are descendants of two \nancient peoples, the Canaanites and the Philistines’(Tessler 2009, 69). It affirms \nfurther their long possession of the land when considering them as a political \ncommunity: ‘The Palestinians do possess a sense of political community built, in \npart, on bonds and experiences that make them unique, including centuries of \nlife in their ancestral homeland, their particular response to currents of reform in \nthe nineteenth century, and subsequent confrontations with Zionism and \nEuropean imperialism’(Tessler 2009, 72). The book, at the same time, does not \ngo particularly far to emancipate its view of the Palestinian people from the \nZionist emphasis on a Western idea of nationalism as a determinative factor in \nrecognizing them as a people who own the land: ‘Nevertheless, important as \nare these latter considerations, they did not come together to create and define \na sense of Palestinian peoplehood, or nationalism, until the beginning of the \n199 | P a g e\npresent century’(Tessler 2009, 72). Palestinian nationalism, however, is \nrecognized as not less valuable than that of other Arab nations’: ‘One is to \nfoster recognition that the late development of Palestinian nationalism \nrepresents a pattern that is common in the Arab world and, as a consequence, \nthat the right to self-determination proclaimed by Palestinians is no less valid \nthan that put forward by the Arab inhabitants of other territorial units’(Tessler \n2009, 73). The book goes further, viewing the case from a wider, global \nperspective, to give further credit to Palestinian nationalism: ‘It is thus no less \nindigenous, authentic, and genuine than that of dozens of societies whose \nclaims to self-determination and national independence are today accepted \nwithout reservation’(Tessler 2009, 73). The book makes clear that the stake \nPalestinians have in the land entitles them to rule their own destiny in Palestine; \n‘It may be added that even were this not the case, Palestinians would still \npossess the right to reside in and rule over their ancestral homeland, managing \ntheir own affairs in accordance with the evolving will and consciousness of the \nmajority of their country’s citizens’(Tessler 2009, 73). The book, in this section, \ngives another non -Zionist credit to the Arabs of the land;\n‘They didn’t carry an anti-Semitic view of the Jews of the land; ‘A \nreview of Arab history from pre-Islamic times until the present makes \nclear that this is not the case. Just as the history of the Jewish people \nhas been shaped by both its own internal dynamics and the wider \nsweep of world events, and even in Palestine did not include a \nconfrontation with Arabs until a century ago, …(Tessler 2009, 73)’ \nThe image of the land, before the arrival of the first Zionist settlers, is mostly the \none that is advanced by Zionist historiography; ‘Palestine was poorly governed \nand marked by a climate of broad insecurity, which contributed directly to its \nunderdeveloped character’(Tessler 2009, 123). Palestine, according to the \nbook, was a land of diseases; ‘In addition, such diseases as cholera, smallpox, \nand malaria were widespread, with epidemics common’(Tessler 2009, 124). \nThese serious problems, according to Zionist historiography made it a land \nwithout (a sizable number of) people. This Zionist view is reflected in the book:\n‘These conditions forced land out of cultivation and disrupted \nagriculture, making hunger a serious problem in many areas. Trade \n200 | P a g e\nand commerce were also discouraged by the unsettled \ncircumstances of the territory, further reinforcing the country’s \nimpoverishment. These obstacles to development help to explain the \nsmall size of Palestine’s population, which was approximately \n300,000 during the latter part of the eighteenth century, or even less \naccording to some estimates’(Tessler 2009, 124).\nThe book, however, provides some non-Zionist comments on that situation. \nFirst of all the condition is described as similar to that in many other regions: \n‘Shaping the character of early contact between Zionists and Arabs was the fact \nthat in the nineteenth century Palestine was among the less-developed regions \nof the Arab world. The circumstances of the country were by no means unique; \nthe problems it faced, while serious, did not differ greatly from those confronting \nmany other regions’(Tessler 2009, 123). It also refers to some improvement in \nthe land’s condition that is not related to Zionist involvement: ‘Further, economic \nand political conditions improved noticeably during the last decades of the \ncentury, in ways, moreover, that had little to do with the arrival of the first Zionist \nsettlers’(Tessler 2009, 123). An Ottoman sultan is introduced as the man \nresponsible for this development: ‘The poverty, lawlessness, and chaos of life in \nPalestine began to decline under the reign of Abdul Hamid, the Ottoman sultan \nwho ruled from 1876 until 1909’(Tessler 2009, 125). It is made clear that these \ndevelopments improved the condition of Palestine before an active Zionist \npresence in the land: ‘Under these conditions, the standard of living gradually \nimproved and the indigenous population began to increase. There was even a \nsmall amount of Arab immigration from northern Syria’(Tessler 2009, 125). This \nis not in agreement with the Zionist historiographical tendency that portrays the \nland as an uninhabitable place where living conditions improved only when the \nZionist settlers came in.\nSummary of the Analysis\nGenerally speaking the book, as articulated in the Preface tends to sympathise \nwith both sides of the conflict; Palestinians and Israelis. This tendency regulates \nthe arguments and conclusions offered by the book. There are efforts, hence, to \n201 | P a g e\nportray a better and more understandable image of the conflicting forces in the \nland. This view not only advances the equality claim but also rejects any \npossibility of oppressor-oppressed or occupier-occupied relations between the \ntwo sides of the question. The Palestinians’ history would be the main loser \nwhen such relations are ignored. It is notable that this tendency helps in some \ncases to exhibit a more understandable picture of the Palestinian case as well. \nThe book seems willing to do this job. What limits the book’s achievement in \nthis area is its reliance, as a history based on secondary sources, on Zionist \nworks. The book acknowledges, however, that there are biased works on both \nsides and tries to create a distance; ‘Not surprisingly, Zionist supporters tended \nto minimize the figure, while pro-Arab sources inflated its magnitude’(Tessler \n2009, 177).\nThe main concluding point, about this textbook, is related to the essential \nelements of the Zionist historiography of the pre-Zionist era: the book publishes, \nwith considerable details, the Zionist history of ancient times. All the Zionist \nclaims about the Jewish ancient achievements in Palestine are presented as \nhistorical facts. Nothing is found in the book to raise some sort of scientific \nscepticism about the myths or contested claims presented by Zionist \nhistoriography. The second element of Zionist historiography is made \nacceptable when the book takes the myth of expulsion as true history. The book \nmakes no special effort to support this idea but it, clearly, takes it for granted, \nalthough with brief treatment. This brevity would not prevent the reader from \nrelying on this story. In the next stage, the diaspora redemptionist efforts, the \nbook creates some serious distance between itself and the standard Zionist \nhistoriography when it rejects such happenings in Jewish diaspora history. It \nalso confirms that the Jewish tradition not only made no call for redemption in \nPalestine but made the opposite by calling it a divine plan (to be far from Zion). \nThe book, however, supports the main Zionist claim of this era; that Jews \nthought of Palestine as their homeland and hoped to return to it. The book \nacknowledges the religious and messianic property of such an attachment but \nsuch an attitude is considered, according to the book, as an historical \nmanifestation of Jewish aspiration, of a people who lost their home and hoped\nto return. In this regard the book emphasises strongly the peoplehood of the \nJewish people but it refrains from using racial reasoning/arguments to prove the \n202 | P a g e\nexistence of such a nation. There is a considerable reliance on the biblical \nnarratives as the authoritative sources of history. The history of this book, \ngenerally, is influenced by the religious tradition. One instance can be seen \nwhen the book refers to ‘false messiahs’; ‘Messianic speculation continued \nthrough the ages, there being many false messiahs and many occasions when \nJewish mystics proclaimed the Day of Judgment…’(Tessler 2009, 17). It is \nevident, without a kind of reliance on religious traditions, that there is no way to \ndetermine the falsehood of such messianic efforts. \nThe Arab history of the land also reveals a mixed treatment of the question; the \nbook, similar to other Zionist histories, does not stress the long history of Arabs \nin the land. There is nothing to make the reader aware that the Jewish history of \nthe land is not in a position to compete with the Arab history of the land; the \ndifference between these two is very close to the difference between myth and \nfact; almost the whole factual history of the land is located in the Arab era. The \nbook, at the same time, refers, very briefly, to the centuries of Arab history of \nthe land. Palestine before the arrival of the first Zionists is portrayed as a barren \nand dangerous land with a small population as it has been exhibited in the \nZionist historiography but at the same time, it considers this situation as not \nvery different from that in other Arab lands, a consideration that might reduce \nthe strength of the Zionist argument for a claim on the land. It also confirms that \nthere were improvements in the land’s condition before the Zionist involvement \nin the land. This might further weaken the Zionist argument. The Palestinians \nare introduced as a distinct community but not as a nation. Palestinian \nnationalism is introduced as a late phenomenon, compared to that of the Jews, \nbut not less valuable than other nationalist movements in other Arab lands. The \nbook’s treatment of the Arab history of the land is different from the standard \nZionist historiography that tends to reject or weaken the Palestinian claim on \nPalestine. Such treatment of the question’s history provides some space, as \nthe writer wishes, for both sides to have something in the land they ‘historically’ \nbelong to.\n203 | P a g e\nAnalysis of the Fifth Textbook:\nThe book, A History of Israel: From the Rise of Zionism to Our Time, is written \nby an American writer, Howard Morley Sachar, and published in the United \nStates by Alfred A. Knopf publishing house in New York. The book originally \nwas the first volume of a two - volume book when it was published first in 1976. \nThe second one, A History of Israel: From The Aftermath of The Yom Kippur \nWar, was written in 1979 to cover the history from 1974 onwards. The book, \nnow in its third edition (2007), covers the whole subject until the Israeli \naggression against Lebanon in 2006; through its last chapter: ‘XLI A Middle \nEastern Hour of Decision’. The book is now a long one, comprising 1296 pages. \nIt is a common source of reference on the history of Israel. Figures provided in \nGoogle Scholar demonstrate that it has been cited by 473 articles and books. It \nis, also, a book recommended by pro-Israeli groups as an ‘authoritative’ reading \non the history of Israel (Rozenman 2004). The survey conducted for the sake of \nthis research shows that it has been adopted as a textbook in 5 countries (out of \n6 countries of the research area) i.e. the US (66), the UK (10), Canada (6), \nAustralia (4), and Ireland (1), altogether in 87 extracted syllabi. As a result, it \nranked in this research as the fifth most adopted textbook in Western countries, \nin the area of History of Israel.\nThe book is comprised of 41 chapters; the first 13 chapters of the book are \ninvestigated for the sake of this research. Chapter 14 and succeeding chapters \ndeal with Israel’s history after the establishment of Israel in 1948. It seems \nunlikely that any major reference to pre-Zionist history of the land occurs in \nthese unexamined chapters. A list of examined chapters is listed as follow:\n I The Rise of Jewish Nationalism\n II The Beginning of the Return\n III Herzl And the Rise of Political Zionism\n IV The Growth of the Yishuv\n V The Balfour Declaration\n VI The Establishment of the Mandate\n VII Building the Jewish National Home\n VIII The Seeds of Arab-Jewish Confrontation\n IX Britain Repudiates the Jewish National Home\n204 | P a g e\n X Palestine in World War II\n XI The Yishuv Repudiates the Mandate\n XII The Birth of Israel\n XIII The War of Independence\nAnalysis: This book has chosen to deal with Israel’s history from the rise of \nZionism as its title reflects; there is not a separate chapter or even a full \nparagraph to represent Jewish history in antiquity. There are certain parts of its \ncontents, however, that deal, explicitly or implicitly, with pre-Zionist history \nunder other subjects. The first one is presented right in the first lines of the book \nwhen French Jews’ encounter with Napoleon and how they responded to \nNapoleon's nationalist call is reported; French Jews, one can learn, held a \nmeeting in Paris to formulate their answer to 12 questions asked by Napoleon. \nThis meeting is called, in the book, ‘a modern version of the council (Sanhedrin) \nthat had issued and enforced the laws during the Jewish Commonwealth of \nantiquity. The ancient body plainly had languished following the destruction of \nJewish statehood at the hands of the Romans’(Sachar 2007, 3). The book used \na chance, here, to present some history about ancient Israel, mentioning the \n‘fact’ that there was a ‘Jewish statehood’ in Palestine that lasted until it was \n‘destroyed by Romans’. Later in the book, another statement is constructed to \nreport Napoleon’s demands of French Jews, in return for what had been \nprovided for them by the new French government: ‘He demanded specific \nassurances that rabbinical jurisdiction in Jewish civil and judicial affairs was a \nthing of the past, that the Jews had turned their backs forever on their \nseparate nationhood, on their corporative status, and not least of all on their \ntraditional hope for redemption in Palestine’(Sachar 2007, 3). This assertion \nworks to confirm the historicity of the Zionist claim that Jews considered \nthemselves, before the rise of Zionism, as a separate nation, denial of which is \nwhat the writer believes that Napoleon asked for in abundance. A hope, carried \nby this nation, to return to Palestine is immediately introduced here as another \nfact that characterized Jews before the Napoleonic era. This report is continued \nwith the French Jews’ answers to the questions asked by Napoleon: that ‘they \n“no longer formed a nation”; and that they had renounced forever their dream of \ncollective exodus to the ancestral Land of Israel’(Sachar 2007, 4). This \nsentence ‘No longer formed a nation’ which is part of the Jewish answer to \nquestion 5 is taken as a basis for supporting the Zionist claim that there was an \n205 | P a g e\noriginal Jewish dream of collective ‘exodus’ to Palestine which is defined by the \nbook as their ‘ancestral land’. The knowledge provided by Shlomo Sand in ‘The \ninvention of the Jewish People’ about the history of Jewish nationalism and its \nemergence in the second half of the 19th century informs us that using the term \n‘nation’ should not imply a reference to its modern meaning when it is used here \nin 1807. It might be used to stress the fact that French Jews are part of the \nFrench nation and don’t see themselves in any other way. This can be seen \nmore clearly if the relevant questions are taken into consideration. The \nmentioned Jewish statement was part of the Jews’ answer to the fifth question. \nThe fifth question is asked in the context of the fourth one:\n4. In the Jews’ eyes, are Frenchmen considered as brethren or as strangers?\n5. In either case, what relations does their law prescribe for them toward \nFrenchmen who are not of their religion?(de-Malkhuta and Graff 2003, 77)\nAs it can be seen here the questions posed are not about how Jews see \nthemselves but how they view other French men who are not Jewish. This idea \nis supported in an answer to the next question, question 6:\n6. Do the Jews born in France, and treated by the laws as French citizens, \nacknowledge France as their country? Are they bound to defend it? Are they \nbound to obey its laws and to follow all the provisions of the Civil Code? (de\u0002Malkhuta and Graff 2003, 77–78)\nThe Jewish answer is reported as such: ‘The response went on to declare that \nthe Jews were so bound up with their country that a French Jew would feel \nhimself a stranger in England, among Jewish company, and vice versa. \nJudaism was thus merely a religious confession’ (de-Malkhuta and Graff 2003, \n86). With all this, even if the writer’s claim is valid, and this Jewish meeting in \nParis used the term ‘nation’ in its modern sense, it is quite clear that he, in the \nwake of this French case, jumps to establish a general conclusion, without \nproviding further evidence from other cases, about all Jews in Europe and \nAmerica being a nation with an aspiration to return to the ancestral land i.e. \nPalestine. The writer stresses this in the conclusion of the account:\n206 | P a g e\n‘To protect what they had achieved in civic freedom, moreover, \nWestern Jews, in the United States and Europe alike, tended to \naccept the emerging nineteenth-century consensus that loyalty to a \nnational state was incompatible with pluralism in cultures. In \nincreasing numbers, they dropped the traditional allusions to Zion in \ntheir ritual observances and spoke of the messianic age less in terms \nof return to the Land of Israel than of a miraculous “end of days,” or \nof an era of “universal brotherhood’ (Sachar 2007, 4).\nThis statement works to establish, again, that ‘returning to the land of Israel’ \nwas a Jewish national aspiration. This is not a fact. It is recalled that this is a \nZionist claim produced by Zionist writers in the nineteenth and twentieth \ncenturies. The statement also provides a justification, at the same time, for the \nfact that nothing significant can be found in any modern history of the Jews, in \nthe US or Europe, which demonstrates the Jewish attachment to such an \naspiration. The Jews dropped the idea, the writer claims, for the sake of modern \nnational rights in Western countries.\nThe next story that serves the same purpose is that of the Russian Jews: \n‘Among the most cherished features of the Russian Jewish cultural \nheritage, surely, was the memory of the ancestral homeland ,the \nlost and lamented Zion that was enshrined in the ceremony and \nfolklore of virtually every believing Jew. The truth was that \nthroughout all the centuries of Jewish dispersion until modern \ntimes, Zion, hardly less than the Deity, functioned as a binding \nintegument of the Jewish religious and social experience’(Sachar \n2007, 5).\nHere in support of another Zionist claim Zion (Palestine) is introduced as the \n‘ancestral homeland’ of the Jewish people. In the next sentence the dispersion \nof the Jewish people from this land is confirmed. Later in this historical report \nthe religious obsession of Jews with the Holy Land is contextualized in a \nnationalist aspiration: ‘Rabbinic and midrashic literature, the prayer book, \nmedieval literary treatises, all displayed a uniform preoccupation with the Holy \nLand. Poets, philosophers, mystics, liturgists in Spain, North Africa, and Europe \n207 | P a g e\ntraditionally vied with one another in expressing the yearning of the People of \nIsrael for the ravished cradle of its nationhood’(Sachar 2007, 5). \nThe dispersion from the national home was confirmed in another statement: \n‘Jewish festivities and holidays— Passover, Chanukkah , Sukkot, Shavuot—all \nevoked and refined memories of the departed national hearth’(Sachar 2007, \n5). In a later statement the writer establishes that Russian Jews, also, wished \nfor a time in the future when ‘redemption of the sacred soil’ is realized; ‘In the \nmanner, then, of other ethnic-religious Eastern communities— of the Greeks \nand Armenians, for example Russian Jews continued to nourish the vision of a \nfuture apocalypse, the redemption of the sacred soil’(Sachar 2007, 5).\nIn this section the writer produces another significant statement: \n‘On the other hand, the Jews of the Pale resisted all attempts to \n“force the end.” In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the \nexcesses and perversions of a series of false messiahs had burned \ntheir fingers badly. Messianism was transformed, rather, into \nattendance upon a halcyonic era that alone would signal final \nredemption in the Land of Israel’(Sachar 2007, 5).\nThis statement has the capacity to support the Zionist claims in two ways: first it \nagain stresses and supports the claim that there was a Jewish aspiration for \nredemption in Palestine, which has been resisted. At the same time it can \nprovide some justification for why there was no sign of a major movement to \nrealize such an aspiration for almost two thousand years of the Jewish \n‘diaspora’.\nThe next section of the book, ‘The link with the land, is the main site where the \nwriter supports Zionist historiography about the Pre-Zionist era including \n‘ancient Israel’. The section starts with a report of some Jewish families in \nPeki’in, a village near Safed, that can ‘demonstrate’ the Jewish presence in the \nland from the ancient time; ‘But authentic they are, these little Arabized Jews, \nthe embodiment of a physical Jewish connection with Palestine that never quite \nexpired’(Sachar 2007, 18). Here a claim by a few Jews about their continuous \nsettlement on the land for more than 2000 years is taken as a proof for the \n208 | P a g e\nZionist contention that the ‘Jewish connection with Palestine never expired’. A \nstatement is presented after that which supports the historicity of the expulsion; \n‘The Romans may have laid the entire nation waste between A.D. 70 and 135, \nslaughtering as many as 600,000 Jews, and carrying off half that number in \nbondage. Yet even in the wake of this monumental dispersion, a few thousand \nJews somehow remained on in the country’(Sachar 2007, 18). This presence \nalso provides a context in a national sense, framing the settlement of a few \nJews on the land as a ‘remnant’ of an ancient nation that has been expelled \nfrom the land. In line with another Zionist myth these Jews who lived, \nsupposedly, about 2 thousand years in an Arab community and spoke Arabic \nare not considered Arabs. Another term, ‘Arabized’ is constructed to put some \ndifference between them and other Arab inhabitants of the land; Muslim and \nChristians. This story is also a place where the destruction of the second temple \nis presented as a fact while an old synagogue in the village is described; ‘It is an \nancient structure. We are informed that the two carved stones in its walls once \nbelonged to the original Temple of Jerusalem, destroyed by the Romans more \nthan 1,900 years before’(Sachar 2007, 18). ‘We are informed’ can mean that \nthis is an ancient structure according to what is said in this regard in the village \nbut the writer’s business is producing a ‘fact’ when dealing with the ‘temple of \nJerusalem’ where an exact time for its destruction is also provided. The \nexistence of this temple and where it was located is established in another \nstatement; ‘There, abutting the Haram el-Sharif complex of mosques, was the \nvenerated Jewish Western Wall (often called the “Wailing Wall”), a remnant of \nthe Hebrew Temple of antiquity’(Sachar 2007, 173). Other Zionist claims about \nIsrael’s antiquity such as Jerusalem being an ‘ancient capital’ of the Jewish \nstate (Sachar 2007, 22 & 23), and the existence of a Jewish kingdom under \nKing David (Sachar 2007, 20) are passed off as history in this section. However, \nthe main function of this section in supporting the Zionist mythology is the one \nwhich is constructed to establish the myth of continuous Jewish ‘redemptionist \nefforts’ to return to the home land. A few migrations of a few Jews, such as \nmight have happened in almost all lands in which Jews lived, are taken as\nestablishing 2000 years of Jewish efforts ‘to return to the ancestral soil’. A \nnumber of justifications are provided, also, to justify why, against all these \nefforts, the Jewish population was so limited on the land before the rise of \nZionism. In this regard not only are contested stories suggested as facts but \n209 | P a g e\nalso kinds of factual statements are made that no fair historian can dare to \nprovide for a time that far away: ‘During the three and a half centuries of Roman \ndominion after the first century A.D., not a single Jew had been permitted to set \nfoot in the ravaged capital’(Sachar 2007, 20). Many different reasons are \nprovided that include the crusaders’ involvement in Palestine, Ottoman \ntreatment of the Jews and even an earthquake to justify how all these \nredemptionist efforts have not resulted in increasing Jewish population in \nPalestine (Sachar 2007, 20).\nThere are other cases of advocating Zionist history in other parts of the book. \nThe following statements by the writer represent some of them:\n CHAPTER II of the book titled ‘The Beginning of the Return’\n ‘As early as 1894, Chaim Nachman Bialik, the greatest of the Hebrew \npoets, captured the anguish of a people deprived of its soil’ (Sachar \n2007, 74)\n ‘How far, then, had the return to Zion materialized?’ (Sachar 2007, 88)\n ‘It was the anniversary of Chanukkah, commemorating the Maccabean \ntriumph that had liberated ancient Palestine and opened a renewed \nera of Jewish national glory’(Sachar 2007, 113).\n ‘There were other advantages, too, well beyond the emotional \ncompensation of returning to the soil’ (Sachar 2007, 150).\nThese cases can support, in one way or another, Zionist mythology about the \nhistory of the question. In this way they work like the Zionist terminology that is \nused in Zionist reports of history. This terminology is constructed on the basis of \nZionist stories, and loaded with Zionist claims. Using them without raising an \nawareness of its covert claims can reinforce the Zionist myth, and mislead the \nstudents of history. It is noteworthy that nothing can be found in the book to \nmake such awareness possible or to challenge the historicity of these loaded \nterms. There is no sign of creating some distance when these proprietary terms \nare used, including applying quotation marks. As a result they can be taken \neasily as facts of history while some of them are contested claims. Many others \ncome from a pure religious tradition or national myth, and not from an \n210 | P a g e\nauthoritative source of history. Some of these terms are mentioned earlier. A \nnon-exhaustive list of these terms which are used frequently in the book is \nmade here:\n Jewish ancestral land, or ancestral soil\n Return or return to Zion\n The ancient capital\n Jewish National Home\n Jewish soil\n the exodus (of German Jews for instance)\n Exile\n Aliyah\n Diaspora\n Redemption or land of redemption\n Yishuv\n Expulsion\nIn this section, ‘the Jewish history’ of the land, the book avails itself of even tiny \nchances, if not inventing them, to portray this history as the real and principal \nhistory of the land. There is no reference, whatsoever, to inform the readers that \nthis history concerns a time that is so far back, thousands of years ago, that \nhistory, in a scientific sense, has not a real chance to confirm what really \nhappened. There is no awareness, as well, that in practice there is not enough \nhistorical evidence to support the Zionist ancient stories. The Arab history of the \nland, in comparison, is located in a very different part of history. It happened in \ntimes close to our time and to our eyes. And also it lasted more than 1000 \nyears. This part of the land’s history is documented in many trustworthy sources \nof history. The situation is so different here that one can dare to argue that the \nwhole history of the land, in its accurate and scientific sense, is Arab. No other \nhistory of the land can compete with the Arab one in this sense. There might not \nbe many places in the world with such clear history. However, all this clear and \nestablished history is ignored in Zionist historiography. One clear example can \nbe seen in this book: no real reference, whatsoever, was made to such history. \nIn contrast, all chances are used to undermine this history. There is a section in \nthe book, in fact, that formulates a main thrust of this endeavour titled ‘THE\nARABS OF PALESTINE’. Without any mention of the long Arab history in the \n211 | P a g e\nland, the book starts with an interesting statement: ‘As late as 1882 the Arab \npopulation of Palestine barely reached 260,000. Yet by 1914 this number had \ndoubled, and by 1920 it had reached 600,000. Under the mandate the figure \ngrew even more dramatically, climbing to 840,000 by 1931, and representing 81 \npercent of the country’s inhabitants’ (Sachar 2007, 167). This statement can \nwork to give some clear messages about the Arab history of the land:\n The Arab population of the land was so limited: “It barely reached ...”. \nThe phrase ‘as late as 1882’ can mean that it was probably less in an \nearlier time. It is quite obvious, however, that this land had a large \nnumber of Arab inhabitants when the Zionist settlers first entered the \nland. This ‘unpleasant’ fact is explained, in the book, through a sudden \ngrowth that happened for different reasons including the Arab migration \nfrom other countries; ‘It was not all natural increase. During those twenty\u0002four years approximately 100,000 Arabs entered the country from \nneighboring lands’(Sachar 2007, 167).\n Palestine was, completely, an Arab land. Different strategies are used to \nundermine this reality. First of all Arab Jews are excluded from the Arab \npopulation when Christian Arabs are included regularly. Arab Jews who \nhappened to oppose the Zionist project when it entered Palestine, \nhowever, are placed in another category, that of Jews, that regards them, \nwrongly, as part of the European Zionists. A different strategy is used by \nthe writer in the quoted passage to show that the Arab population rate, \n81 percent, is a figure that was reached after an increase in the Arab \npopulation, misleading the readers on the fact that that Palestine was \nfully Arab before the Zionist settlement.\nThe efforts to discount the Arab demographic reality in the land are reinforced \nby another statement: \n‘As a Marxist, Borochov did not justify the choice of Palestine along \nromantic, nationalistic lines. Rather, he argued that Palestine was a \nsite dictated exclusively by “stychic” (automatic, ineluctable) factors. \nIn other nations, he explained, the absorptive capacity for \nimmigration was limited. What was needed was a land in which Jews \ncould freely enter all branches of the economy, where Jewish \n212 | P a g e\nworkers could participate in basic industries and agriculture. The land \nmust be semiagricultural and thinly populated. Such a country, in \nfact, was Palestine, for Palestine alone was lacking in a national \ntradition of its own, in attraction for European immigrants, or in \nsignificant cultural and political development’(Sachar 2007, 70). \nThe Zionist claim to Palestine did need a construction that undermined, not only \nthe livelihood in the populated Palestinian land but also offered a gap, a vacuum \nin national tradition and institutions as the above passage manages to provide. \nThe whole history of the land as a heartland of Arab population is ignored in this \nconstruction. The only valid principle for accepting the fact that there is a people \nwho live in the land they own, is the Western idea of nationalism, that Palestine \nlacked; ‘Perhaps the Zionists were not altogether culpable in failing to take Arab \nnationalism seriously. The phenomenon barely existed before 1908’(Sachar \n2007, 164). In other parts of the book, the land, before Zionism, is introduced as \na dry, fruitless and diseased land that was characterized by poverty, disease, \nbandits and backwardness; ‘The Moslem Arabs— the majority— were much \nmore backward’(Sachar 2007, 167).\nSummary of the Analysis\nThe analysis of the book, elaborated here, demonstrates that this textbook \npasses off the Zionist mega narrative as fact; it confirms that there was an \nancient Jewish statehood; that this was destroyed by the Romans, who expelled \nthe Jews of the land, except a few thousand, to their diaspora; that an aspiration \nto Jewish nationhood, and also a hope for redemption in Palestine, as a \nnational home, continued to live all the time after their expulsion from Palestine; \nthat Palestine is the ancestral homeland of the Jews; that Jerusalem was the \nancient capital of the Jewish state; that there was a Jewish kingdom under King \nDavid; that there were 2000 years of ‘redemptionist efforts’ to return to the \nhome land. All this history, constituting the main elements of the Zionist \nhistoriography of the pre-Zionist era, is represented as factual history; nothing is \nfound in the related statements that shows any kind of distancing from these \nZionist claims, or refers to a challenge or any consideration that hints that this \n213 | P a g e\nmight not reflect what really happened, that this might be a myth or a contested \nclaim. The strategy that governs passing this account off as history is not, \nmainly, a direct one. The book commonly produces this history through \nstatements that are directed at stating something else. The main elements of \nthe Zionist historiography, presented in this book, are taken for granted when \nsomething else is apparently at stake. Some Zionist claims are naturalised \nthrough Zionist terminology such as “Jewish ancestral homeland”.\nIn contrast to how the book treats the Jewish ‘mythistory’ of the land, the long \nArab history of the land that is supported by many solid facts is ignored. No real \nreference to lifetime Arab settlement in the land has been made; there are also \nattempts in the book to undermine it. Palestine, before the arrival of the Zionist\nsettlers, is displayed as a dry and diseased land, with a tiny population, far from \ncivilization or national aspiration.\n214 | P a g e\nAnalysis of the Sixth Textbook:\nThe book, Israel-Arab Reader: A Documentary History of the Middle East \nConflict, was first published in 1969 by Citadel Press in the USA. Its latest \nedition, the 7th one, is examined for this textbook analysis. The citation figure of \nthe book in Google Scholar, 305, also introduces the book as a popular \nreference used by other writers in the field. The book’s popularity in scholarly \ncircles is confirmed by the results of the survey conducted in this research to \nidentify the most adopted textbooks in Western universities; it has been, \naltogether, in 78 syllabi in 4 countries of the survey, the UK (7), Canada (9), \nNew Zealand (2), and the US (60). These results position the book as the sixth \nmost adopted textbook in Western academia to teach the history of Israel. The \nentire book is merely a collection of relevant documents that are organized in \nchronological order, from early Zionism in 1882 to the Annapolis Conference in \n2007. There is no place for actual historiography in this book even to cover \nsome common properties of a textbook such as ‘Introduction’ or ‘Conclusion’. \nVery little is written by the editors of the book, Walter Laqueur and Barry Rubin, \nto narrate the Israel/Palestine history; a few lines are added in some cases to \nintroduce the document. As a result, no real historiography can be found in its \nexact sense. This leaves not much chance of examining how the history of the \nquestion is written. There is nothing wrong with such a strategy. But the book is \ntoo short, measured against the existing expectations of a textbook at that level, \nto clarify how these documents are selected: why some documents are included \nand why others are excluded; how they are translated, in case of translation, \nhow they are produced, in full or in part; and if in part, what is the governing \nprinciple for excluding some parts of the document. A possible bias might lie \nhere that could be a source for an analysis through other methods, those which \nfocus on these aspects and not just on historical narrative. The book’s paucity \nof clarification on these points does not support its status as an unbiased \ntextbook. The book is short, as well, on providing the proper references for the \ndocuments produced. From almost 190 documents produced in this book, only \n46 have references. These references are too short, in many cases to provide \nenough information about the source of the documents. In one case, in the first \nfootnote, only the translator’s name is given (Laqeuer and Rubin 2008, 10).\n215 | P a g e\nFrom the standpoint of research, one point might be made: the book opens with \na document that was published, according to the book, by a Jewish group, the \nBilu Group, in Constantinople in 1882. This manifesto, as it is called in the book, \nhas many elements of Zionist mythology about the pre-Zionist era:\n‘To our brothers and sisters in Exile! \nIf I help not myself, who will help me?’ Nearly two thousand years \nhave elapsed since, in an evil hour, after a heroic struggle, the \nglory of our Temple vanished in fire and our kings and \nchieftains changed their crowns and diadems for the chains of \nexile. We lost our country where dwelt our beloved sires. Into \nthe Exile we took with us, of all our glories, only a spark of the \nfire by which our Temple, the abode of our Great One, was \nengirdled, and this little spark kept us alive while the towers of \nour enemies crumbled into dust, and this spark leapt into celestial \nflame and shed light on the heroes of our race and inspired them to \nendure the horrors of the dance of death and the tortures of the \nautos-da-fé. And this spark is again kindling and will shine for us, a \ntrue pillar of fire going before us on the road to Zion, while behind us \nis a pillar of cloud, the pillar of oppression threatening to destroy us. \nSleepest thou, O our nation? . . . WE WANT: 1. A home in our \ncountry. It was given us by the mercy of God; it is ours as \nregistered in the archives of history… We hope that the interests \nof our glorious nation will rouse the national spirit in rich and \npowerful men, and that everyone, rich or poor, will give his best \nlabours to the holy cause.

There is no more chance, as mentioned, in the \nbook to support such possible bias by exploring other instances in such a \ndocumentary book. It looks impossible to verify such hypotheses from this piece \nof research’s perspective. This constitutes, in fact, the main point about this \nbook and its analysis.\nHowever, it is evident that this book is recommended by some pro-Israeli \nbodies, such as CAMERA, as an authoritative reference: ‘The Israel-Arab \nReader is a thorough and up-to-date guide to the continuing crisis in the Middle \nEast. It covers the full spectrum of the Israel-Arab conflict-from the earliest \ndays, through the wars and peace - making efforts, up to the Israel-PLO and \nIsrael-Jordan peace accords.

This analysis allowed an investigation, the aim of which is to \nanswer the question of ‘how’ in relation to a piece of research; how do certain \nWestern textbooks treat the history of the Israel/Palestine question? This has \nbeen done in the previous chapter through an exploration of the \nstructure/narratio of the selected histories. There is an emphasis in this analysis \non the role of historians, whose tendencies/decisions are seminal in determining \nthe main structure of a constructed history; the relevant point made in Chapter 4 \nshould be borne in mind: ‘It is argued that the meaning of the ‘facts’ produced in \na certain history is dependent on the process of placing as it functions in the \nnarratio. The rhetoric is considered ineffective if not reinforced by a structure to \nsupport it. It is revealed that such structure comes from the main ideological \npositions that historians take towards the history. There is an emphasis, in this \nmethodology, on the role historians play in constructing historical knowledge. \nThis analysis is influenced by an observation that promotes a shift from ‘great \nstories’ to ‘great story tellers’.\nFrom this perspective, historians are considered as primarily responsible for the \nhistory produced. They constitute the immediate context of the constructed \nknowledge, where wider contexts such as the social and the national are \nlocated farther, and they can be a relevant answer to the question, ‘Why?’: why \ndo the selected histories treat the Israel/Palestine question in a the way they \ndo?\nThe role historians play in determining historical knowledge is not stressed only \nin this methodology; it has been acknowledged and discussed in the broader \nliterature on History; the matter is reflected in textbooks designed to address the \nkey questions of the discipline. ‘History and historians’ is an instance. Its writer, \nMark T. Gilderhus, gives an example about the historian’s role in the \nclarification of this question: ‘Lock ten of them in a room (or a cell) with the \nsame bodies of evidence, and they would in all likelihood arrive at ten divergent \njudgments’(Gilderhus 1987, 82). He mentions some forms of identification, \n219 | P a g e\nclass, race, and religion, as main factors that contribute to how historians write\nhistory(Gilderhus 1987, 82). This general idea develops when a deeper \nawareness of the roles played by historians is provided. This has been recorded \nin two different fields of History; theoretical and empirical studies. On the \ntheoretical level, when epistemological matters are a concern, the matter has \nbeen discussed in the (critical) philosophy of History. Historiography, as a sub\u0002discipline, became, also, a main site for the related discussions. This happened \nwhen the scholarly interest in the idea of ‘narrative’ and how this has been \nformed took place. Nowadays, new fields of academic endeavour such as \n‘Memory Studies’ are engaged in this discussion as well. \nMink and White are introduced as pioneer scholars who provide a considerable \nsource for the study of historians and their loyalties, in the question of producing \nhistory (Roberts 2001, Introduction). They found this factor more important than \nhistorical evidence and facts. They emphasize the idea that the historian \nimposes his ideological beliefs on the facts (Jeretz Topolsky 2013, 12). White in \nhis remarkable contribution to the field, Metahistory, elaborates his idea about \nhow this is possible, and how an historian actually does this, introducing \n‘emplotment’ as a main method (Vanhulle 2009). According to him, the historian\ndoes not just explore the historical matters but makes them. This is possible, \naccording to White, by:\n arranging events in a certain order\n answering questions: what happened? when? how? why?\n deciding which events in the chronicle to include and exclude\n stressing some events and subordinating others(V. Rea 2015)\nIn empirical studies, some areas of history are acknowledged as those that \nprovide plenty of evidence about how historians produce histories that comply \nwith their identity or advance their goals. National histories are regarded as \nclear instances. Historians, when producing national history of their own \nnationality, use the outcomes of archaeology and ancient history as a tool to \nadvance a mythical national history that provides an advantageous place for his\nnation in the history(Berger and Lorenz 2010). The real scope of such \n220 | P a g e\nfabrication and its grave consequences has not been fully recognized but there \nare some scholarly works that touch upon this important matter; ‘The Use and \nAbuse of History: Or How the Past Is Taught to Children’ is a book designed to \nproduce some instances of such biases in various regions of the world(Ferro \n2004). Another book, ‘Writing National Histories: Western Europe Since 1800’ \ninvestigates the role of national historians who produce histories in different \nEuropean countries, Italy, Germany and France, to advance national ideologies, \nand how they use history against their political rivals including socialist, \ncommunist and Catholic internationalism (Berger, Donovan, and Passmore \n1999). A book has been edited by Stefan Berger and Chris Lorenz, \nNationalizing the Past: Historians as Nation Builders in Modern Europe’ which \nanalyses and compares the national histories produced by professional \nhistorians of different European nationalities in the modern era. This analysis \ncan demonstrate the extent to which these histories produce opposing \naccounts, and introduces their producers, historians, as myth makers who \nproduce such histories for the sake of their national ideology(Berger and Lorenz \n2010).\nThere are other scholarly works that make some valuable contribution to the \nrelated discussion; ‘The History and Narrative Reader’ edited by ‘Geoffrey \nRoberts’ is one main instance that looks at the subject through the study of \nnarrative(Roberts 2001). ‘The structure of historical Narratives and the teaching \nof history’ is another instance. In this article, the writer, Jeretz Topolski, provides\na useful analysis of narrative and its three layer structure: \n1. ‘the surface of informing (logical and grammatical) layer; \n2. the persuasive or rhetorical layer and\n3. the theoretical-ideological or controlling (steering) layer’(Jeretz Topolsky \n2013, 12).\nThe third level is considered, in this analysis, as the main place where an \nhistorian’s mind, with its ideas and goals, conscious and unconscious, informs\nthe historical narrative, and appropriates it accordingly (Jeretz Topolsky 2013, \n18–19). The main elements of the historian’s mind that intervene in such a \nprocess are introduced as follows:\n221 | P a g e\n1. ‘the preliminary knowledge (factual and theoretical) in the light of which \nthe historian is studying and conceptualising the past\n2. the linguistic conventions shared by the historian which create a \npreliminary prism which (metaphorically) breaks up the light of the past \ninto the set of words, notions, expressions. etc.\n3. the fundamental myths present in the cultural ‘environment’ of the \nhistorian which influence his or her thinking and imagination as a sui \ngeneris pressure guiding his or her work:\n4. the theoretical and quasi-theoretical (i.e. spontaneous) conceptions \nabout the world and man;\n5. the metaphors in their epistemological function. i.e. a linguistic and at the \nsame time extra-linguistic vehicle for myths, quasi-theories and theories; \nand\n6. the ideology (understood in a more or less coherent way) represented by \nthe author of the text’(Jeretz Topolsky 2013, 19).\nThese elements are regarded as different glasses that mediate between an \nhistorian and the object of his study. The historian can see only what is allowed \nto pass through these glasses. This medium controls what a historian sees, \nunderstands, and ultimately writes(Jeretz Topolsky 2013, 19).\nThis crucial role which historians play in the production of history is \nemphasised, by others, particularly in relation to histories produced on the \nIsrael/Palestine question: ‘It hardly takes a regional expert to perceive that the \nway the \"story\" of the Arab-Israeli conflict is told depends on the perspective of \nthe storyteller’(Isacoff 2005).\nThis chapter is designed to deal with this matter. For this purpose all producers \nof the textbooks selected, writers and editors, are subjected to analysis, to \ndetermine their background in relation to the subject matter of the knowledge \nthey produce on the Israel/Palestine question. The eight historians chosen for \nthis analysis are all those who wrote/edited the 6 selected textbooks. An \ninvestigation is conducted, the aim of which is to gain some insight into the \n222 | P a g e\nideological positions of these historians from their works, interviews, \nautobiographies, acknowledgements, CVs and so on, all from open sources, \nmaterial which should shed some light on their background. The following part \nof the chapter is devoted to the results of this investigation; the historians are \nintroduced in alphabetical order:\nBickerton, Ian:\nIan James Bickerton is co-author of one textbook analysed, A Concise History \nof the Arab-Israeli Conflict. He was born in Perth, Western Australia. Bickerton \ncompleted his undergraduate degree in History there before he moved to the \nUS for post-graduate studies, receiving his MA from Kansas State University, \nand his PhD from the Claremont Graduate School, in California. He later joined \nthe University of New South Wales to teach in the School of History. Bickerton \ntaught a number of courses mainly on the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict, the \nhistory of the modern USA, and the history of US foreign relations. He also \nlectured in several US universities including the University of California Santa \nBarbara and the University of Missouri at Kansas City. Apart from Australia and \nthe USA, he has had some teaching experience in the United Kingdom, in other \nEuropean countries and in Israel(“Ian J. Bickerton” 2015).\nBickerton has numerous publications on the Arab-Israeli conflict and other \nMiddle Eastern questions, including:\n The Arab-Israeli Conflict: A Guide for The Perplexed\n The Arab-Israeli Conflict: A History\n Historiography of The Arab-Israeli Conflict: Contested Spaces\n Forty-Three Days: The Gulf War\nHe is considered as a prominent expert in Middle Eastern studies, and has \ncontributed to a number of entries on Middle Eastern matters in world - class \nencyclopaedias/dictionaries, including:\n Encyclopaedia Britannica\n Dictionary of American Foreign Policy\n SBS World Guide\n223 | P a g e\nBickerton in his recent book, The Arab-Israeli Conflict: A History, acknowledging \nthe reader’s expectation that he would be given information about the writer’s \nbackground, provides some material on this topic. He mentions his educational \nenvironment, where he was educated in pro-Israeli surroundings; \n‘As a teenager I recall thinking with pride, like most Australians, how \nimportant the Australian prime minister, Sir Robert Menzies, must \nhave been as he sailed out of Australia in 1956 to ‘sort out’ the ‘Suez \ncrisis’ although, again, I had little idea of Israel’s role in that abortive \nAnglo-French-Israeli venture to force President Nasser to ‘disgorge’ \nthe Suez Canal. As a graduate student in California, I do remember \nthe 1967 war, however. Like most, I was amazed at Israel’s quick \nand overwhelming success in that short war’ (Bickerton 2009, 17).\nHe considers his background as coming from ‘Irish Catholicism’, and doesn’t \nhide his ‘serious reservations’ about it (Bickerton 2009, 19). No record of a \ncritical report of his views on the Israel/Palestine question has been found in \nPro-Israeli academia monitors, including Campus Watch and CAMERA.\nKlausner, Carla:\nCarla L. Klausner, co-author of a textbook analysed, A Concise History of the \nArab-Israeli Conflict, is an American academic. She completed her degrees in \ndifferent American universities:\n History: Barnard College in 1958\n MA in Middle East Studies: Radcliffe College in 1960\n PhD in History and Middle East Studies: Harvard University in 1963\nAfter graduation she joined University of Missouri - Kansas City as a faculty \nmember, and became director of the Judaic Studies Program in this university. \nAs a professor of history, she taught various courses in the field of Middle East \nhistory; History of Islam, Arabs, Jews and Ottomans(“Department of History: \nCarla L. Klausner” 2014). Her main monographs, two in fact, are co-authored \nwith others:\n224 | P a g e\n From Destruction to Rebirth: The Holocaust and the State of Israel with \nDr. Joseph Schultz, New York: University Press of America, 1978\n A Concise History of the Arab-Israeli Conflict, with Ian J. Bickerton, New \nYork: Prentice Hall, 1991\nOutside academia, she is an active speaker. Gatherings of the Jewish \ncommunity in Kansas are a main platform for her activities. She teaches \nfrequently in ‘The Rabbi Morris B. Margolies Centre of Adult Studies’ ‘in \n‘Congregation Beth Shalom’. ‘The Three Affairs’ series is one instance. \nKlausner talked in this program, beside two other speakers, a Rabbi and an \nAssistant Rabbi, on a title called ‘The Damascus Affair’. The Congregation \nintroduced these three speakers, in the relevant announcement, as ‘three of the \nbest teachers that Congregation Beth Shalom has to offer’(“The Scroll” 2009). \nAnother case of such service is a joint presentation with Rabbi Scott White on \n‘The Arab Spring and What It Means to Israel’(“The Scroll” 2011). Carla \nKlausner is mentioned and thanked repeatedly in ‘Scroll’, the Congregation \nperiodical, for her contributions. Her name is also mentioned in the periodical as \na ‘Minyan Participant’ who has attended the ‘minyanin on a regular basis’(“The \nScroll” 2008). Her mother, Rose Levine, and her husband, Tiberius Klausner, \ntake part in the Congregation’s activities(“Tiberius Klausner” 2015). She also \ncontributed to writing an article titled ‘Rabbi Simon Glazer and the Quest for \nJewish Community in Kansas City, 1920-1923’ that she co-authored with \nJoseph P. Schultz. In this article, a leading Zionist Rabbi in Kansas, Rabbi \nSimon Glazer, is commended for his achievements in developing an \norganization for the Jewish community in the city, and for improving cooperation \namong Jewish Orthodox congregations. One notable achievement mentioned in \nthe article is his campaign to have the US Congress support the Zionist \nmovement to colonize Palestine as a homeland for Jews: ‘Rabbi Glazer's \nalmost one-man campaign had resulted in the most formal possible American \ncommitment in favor of a Jewish homeland in Palestine, and the congressional \nresolution, the first time Congress had been actually involved in support of the \nZionist enterprise, is eloquent testimony to his vision, commitment, political \nacumen, and persuasiveness’(Schultz and Klausner 1983).\nIt is worth mentioning that Congregation Beth Shalom is a Conservative \ncongregation based in Kansas City. It is a main centre for the Jewish \n225 | P a g e\ncommunity in the city, and holds events to support Israel. A joint program with \nOhev Sholom Congregation on ‘Media Bias Against Israel: What We Can Do \nAbout It’ is one instance (“The Scroll” 2011). It also contributes to celebrating \n‘Israeli Independence Day’ and ‘Israeli Memorial Day’ where the congregation \n‘assemble gift packages for soldiers in the Israel Defence Forces’(“The Scroll” \n2014).\nThere is other information which would categorise Klausner as a pro-Israeli \nJew: she was a member of a pro-Israeli society; Scholars for Peace in the \nMiddle East (SPME)(Klausner 1999). She has made many trips to Israel; her \nhusband describes how ‘We always ended up in Israel’. She has stayed in \nIsrael several times; she stayed there with her family for 6 months in one visit. \nHer daughters went to Israeli kindergarten and Kita Aleph to learn Hebrew. \nTheir father, in an interview, expressed his joy over their Israeli accent. He \ncame back to the US but admits in the interview: ‘I would have loved to stay in \nIsrael’. He mentions job considerations as a reason for their return to the United \nStates(Klausner 1999).\nThere are other links to Israel in her family. Her husband, Tiberius (Tibor) \nKlausner, was a member of a Zionist underground organization(Klausner 1999). \nHe is introduced in a book, titled ‘From the Heart: Life Before and After the \nHolocaust’ published by ‘The MidWest Center for Holocaust Education’ as one \nof ‘52 Kansas City Holocaust survivors and war refugees who began their lives \nin homelands far away, who saw their lives unalterably changed by the \nHolocaust, and who rebuilt their lives in America’(Education and Star 2001). In a \nmessage to Jewish children on the Holocaust, which is published in the \nMidWest Centre’s website, Tiberius Klausner calls them to support Israel: ‘My \nmessage for you, our future generation, is to preserve your Jewish heritage and \nbe proud of your Jewishness. When I was studying in Paris, they never let me \nforget I was a foreigner and a Jew. How do you change that? How do you \nchange antisemitism? You must continue to learn about Judaism, practice it, \nlive by its values, pray, and hope. And you have to support Israel’(TIBERIUS \nKLAUSNER 2014). Tibor’s immediate family, parents and brothers, are Israeli. \nHis younger brother served in the Israeli army, and participated in four Israeli \nwars(Klausner 1999).\n226 | P a g e\nLaqueur, Walter:\nWalter Laqueur, an editor of the textbook analysed, Israel-Arab Reader: A \nDocumentary History of the Middle East Conflict, was born into a Jewish family. \nHis parents are reported as victims of the Holocaust, and Walter, himself, is \nregarded as a ‘survivor’. He moved to Israel in 1938 and studied at the Hebrew \nUniversity of Jerusalem. In Israel, he joined a Kibbutz, and worked as an \nagricultural labourer for many years before he moved to Jerusalem to work as a \npolitical journalist. He was engaged in reporting the important developments of \nthe Zionist movement in Palestine before 1948 and afterwards. He had personal \nrelationships with many Zionist leaders including Weizmann, Ben-Gurion, \nSharett, Golda Meir and Yitzhak Rabin (“Biography” 2015).\nHe later joined academia; Laqueur taught in Tel Aviv University as a visiting \nprofessor from 1972 till 1982. He has also taught in many high - ranking \nuniversities including Harvard, the University of Chicago, and Johns Hopkins \nUniversity in the USA. He has written and edited a number of monographs on \nthe Israel/Palestine question:\n A History of Zionism: From the French Revolution to the Establishment of \nthe State of Israel\n The Changing Face of Anti-Semitism: From Ancient Times to the Present \nDay\nHe has also published an autobiography titled ‘Thursday's Child Has Far to Go: \nA Memoir of the Journeying Years’(Laqueur 1992). This title changed later to \n‘Best of Times, Worst of Times: Memoirs of a Political Education’(Laqueur \n2009). A large part of his activities in the Zionist movement, and his ideas about \nIsrael are recorded in this book. He moved to the USA in 1953 but his children \nand grandchildren have remained in Israel(“Biography” 2015).\nThe pro-Israeli organization, CAMERA, recommends Laqueur’s book (The \nIsrael-Arab Reader) in its program, Adopt a Library, as a ‘reliable’ source of \nknowledge on the Israel/Palestine question: ‘The Israel-Arab Reader is a \nthorough and up-to-date guide to the continuing crisis in the Middle East. It \ncovers the full spectrum of the Israel-Arab conflict from the earliest days, \nthrough the wars and peace - making efforts, up to the Israel-PLO and Israel-\n227 | P a g e\nJordan peace accords. This comprehensive reference includes speeches, \nletters, articles, and reports dealing with all the major interests in the area from \nall of the relevant political parties and world leaders’(“Suggested Book List” \n2015).\nMorris, Benny:\nBenny Morris, an Israeli historian, is the author of another textbook selected, \nRighteous Victims: A History of the Zionist – Arab Conflict, which has been \nanalysed in this research. He was born in Israel, in a Kibbutz (Ein HaHoresh), to \nJewish parents who migrated from the UK to Israel. His father, Ya'akov Morris, \nwas an Israeli diplomat. Benny Morris served in the Israeli army, and \nparticipated in the 1967 war. He was wounded in 1969 in an exchange of fire \nwith Egyptian troops in the occupied Sinai near the Suez Canal. He completed \nhis undergraduate studies in History at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and \nhis PhD at the University of Cambridge. After graduation, he joined the Middle \nEast Studies department of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in southern \nIsrael, where he subsequently became Professor of History (Wilson 2007; \nSlater 2012; “Professor Benny Morris Biography” 2015). He has written \nextensively on the history of the Israel/Palestine question. The following can be \nmentioned in this regard:\n 1948: A History of the First Arab-Israeli War\n The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem, 1947-1949\n One State, Two States: Resolving the Israel/Palestine Conflict\nIn some circles, he is regarded as a post - Zionist or ‘new’ historian who \nchallenged the Zionist myths. But he regards himself as a Zionist (Ari Shavit \n2004). His strong Zionist tendency has led him to justify the ethnic cleansing of \nArabs in 1948 and to wish for the expulsion of more Palestinians by Zionists \n(Abunimah 2004). The Acknowledgments in his book, The Righteous Victims, \ndemonstrate that all the funds he received to complete this book are from Israeli \nsources except one contribution from the French Embassy in Israel(Morris \n2001, xi); the archives he consulted to write the book are all Israeli, including \nthe ‘Israel State Archives’, ‘the Central Zionist Archives’ and ‘the Israel Defense \nForces (IDF) Archive’(Morris 2001, xii). Furthermore, all the people he thanks, in \n228 | P a g e\nthe Acknowledgments (in this textbook), for their support are Israelis; there are \na few from the US or the UK but no one is Arab(Morris 2001, xi). He is known \nas a historian who uses and relies on Israeli sources, and not Arab ones.\nRubin, Barry:\nBarry Rubin, an Israeli academic, is the second editor of a textbook selected; \n‘Israel-Arab Reader: A Documentary History of the Middle East Conflict’. He \nwas born in the USA, and completed his PhD (from Georgetown University) in \nthat country. After graduation, he taught in many Israeli and American \nuniversities. For almost two decades, he was the director of the Global \nResearch in International Affairs (GLORIA) at the ‘Interdisciplinary Center \nHerzliya’ in Israel. He worked for The Jerusalem Post as a columnist for a long \ntime. The Middle East and terrorism was his area of expertise. He served as an \neditor on a number of specialised journals including the Middle East Review of \nInternational Affairs (MERIA), and the Turkish Studies Journal(Solomon 2014; \nHaaretz 2014). Rubin was a hardworking writer who authored and edited many \nbooks and articles, including:\n Israel: An Introduction\n The Arab States and the Palestine Conflict (Contemporary Issues in the \nMiddle East)\n Revolution Until Victory?: The Politics and History of the PLO (Selection \nof the History Book Club)\nHis personal blog, The Rubin Report (http://rubinreports.blogspot.com), is a \nmain source for his writings. Rubin is considered as a ‘strenuous defender of \nJews, Israel, and US interests’. In relation to a solution for the Israel-Palestinian \nconflict, he advocated the idea that ‘Jews should defend themselves’. He was \ncritical of the West for its shortcomings in support of Israel. He has written about \nhis ancestry, mentioning some members of his family as victims of the \nHolocaust. He was very passionate about the Zionist idea of the Jewish state. \nHe wrote in this regard: ‘For 2000 years my ancestors dreamed of returning to \ntheir homeland and re-establishing their sovereignty. I have had the privilege of \nliving that dream. How amazing is that?’ (Solomon 2014)\n229 | P a g e\nSachar, Howard:\nHoward Morley Sachar, an American historian, is the author of another textbook \nselected; ‘A History of Israel: From the Rise of Zionism to Our Time’. He was \nborn in St. Louis, Missouri, in the USA into a Jewish family, and studied in that \ncountry. He completed his undergraduate education at Swarthmore and \nreceived his PhD from Harvard. Sachar is based in Washington, D.C. as \nCharles E. Smith Professor of History Emeritus at George Washington \nUniversity. He is known as an expert on Middle East affairs, and lectures in \nmany American universities in this field. He also acts as a consultant in this \narea for many governmental bodies in the US. Sachar has testified before the \nForeign Affairs Committee in the US Congress. He has contributed to training \nprograms for US diplomats. Sachar has edited a thirty-nine-volume history of \nthe question; The Rise of Israel: A Documentary History (Sachar 2007, 1271). \nHe is the author of many articles and 14 books in the field including:\n The Course of Modern Jewish History (1958)\n Diaspora (1985)\n Aliyah (1961)\n Egypt and Israel (1981)\nHe has strong links with Israel, Jews and pro-Israeli circles: He lived in Israel for \nmany years, worked on a kibbutz and founded the ‘Jacob Hiatt Institute’ in \nJerusalem, one of the first academic centres for American students to visit and \nstudy in Israel. He secured funds from the US State Department, in 1965, to \nfound this institute, and served as its director for several years. He has also\ntaught in Israeli universities: The Hebrew University and Tel Aviv University. \nTwo National Jewish Book Awards have been granted to him. Sachar, also, was \nawarded an honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters from the Hebrew \nUnion College-Jewish Institute of Religion in 1996 (Sam Fuchs 2009; Sachar \n2007, 1271). He is a member of the advisory council of ‘J Street’, a pro-Israeli \nlobby in the US(“Advisory Council” 2015).\nSachar’s father, Abram (Abe) Leon Sachar, was also a leading Zionist figure: he \nwas one of the founders of the ‘B'nai B'rith Hillel Foundation’. He acted as the \ndirector of the Illinois sector, and then as National Director of this pro-Israeli \nFoundation (1933 to 1947). Abram Sachar was active in supporting Israel, and \n230 | P a g e\na close friend of its first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion(“Abram L. Sachar” \n2015).\nThere are other links in his family to Israel; his daughter and grandchildren live \nin Israel. When he visited Israel after his graduate studies, and engaged in \nfounding the Jacob Hiatt Institute, he described his mission thus: ‘I was so \ninfatuated with the land and the people and [I had a personal] resolve to get \nJewish people closer to it’(Sam Fuchs 2009).\nSmith, Charles:\nCharles Duryea Smith is an American academic who wrote a textbook selected \n‘Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict’. He completed his studies in the field of \nHistory and Middle East Studies at US universities: his undergraduate degree \nwas from Williams College, his MA from Harvard, and his PhD from the \nUniversity of Michigan. He has taught in various American universities including \nSan Diego State University, Wayne State University, University of Virginia, \nGeorge Mason University, the Virginia Military Institute, and the Virginia \nCommonwealth University. He joined The University of Arizona School of \nMiddle Eastern & North African Studies as a Professor Emeritus of Middle East\nHistory. He has had teaching experience both in Israel and in Arab countries; in \nIsrael, he worked in the Institute for Advanced Study at the Hebrew University of \nJerusalem. In Egypt, he acted as president of the American Research \nCentre(“Charles Smith | School of Middle Eastern & North African Studies” \n2014).\nSmith has authored a number of publications on Middle East History in general, \nand on the Israel/Palestine question in particular:\n The Modern Middle East and North Africa: A History in Documents (co\u0002authored with Julia Clancy-Smith)\n ‘The United States and the 1967 War’ in ‘The 1967 Arab-Israeli War: \nOrigins and Consequences’\n ‘The Arab-Israeli Conflict’ in ‘International Relations of the Middle East’\n231 | P a g e\nIn 2012 he received, from the Middle East Studies Association of North America \n(MESA), a ‘Mentor Award’ for his efforts ‘in advising and guiding students at the \ngraduate and undergraduate levels’. In 2013, his co-authored book (The \nModern Middle East and North Africa: A History in Documents) was accredited, \nby MESA, as ‘the best book on undergraduate education’(“Charles Smith | \nSchool of Middle Eastern & North African Studies” 2014).\nThere are some occasions on which Smith has been attacked by Pro-Israeli \nprotesters for statements he made about the Israel/Palestine question; one\ninstance is recorded by the pro-Israeli monitoring body, Campus Watch’ which \npublished a report, under ‘Middle East studies in the News’ titled ‘On-Campus \nPanels Attack Israel (Again) [incl. Charles Smith, Leila Hudson, Asher \nKaufman]’. The report is written by Shlomo Aronson, a professor from the \n‘American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise’. In this report, Smith is described as a \n‘self styled expert on the Arab-Israeli conflict and the Palestinian issue, who is \nknown for missing command of both Hebrew and Arabic’(Aronson 2009). The \nreport contains a letter, from ‘an outraged listener’, on what went wrong in this \npanel. The letter, supposedly, states: ‘Professor Smith left no question \nregarding his stance on the recent conflict. His presentation began by arguing, \nsomewhat correctly, that Israel was responsible for the birth of Hamas. \nHowever, he continued to tell falsehoods and half-truths, culminating in a \njustification for Hamas' actions’(Aronson 2009). The letter criticises Smith for \nanother statement: ‘He also made mention that the breakdown of the 2000 \nCamp David talks was, despite all accounts from individuals present at those \nnegotiations, the fault of the Israeli leadership. He even went as far as to say, \n\"Clinton, Dennis Ross, and [Ehud] Barak all lied about what happened \nthere\"(Aronson 2009).\nThere are other cases of criticism of Smith from a pro-Israeli stance. One can \nbe seen on a website called ‘Rate my Professor’. A student, allegedly, makes \nanother point in this regard: ‘I took this class expecting an interesting account \non Israeli-Arab relations, but instead I stepped into an anti-Semitic smear fest. \nProfessor Smith is insensitive to the Holocaust and the aftermath of it. There \nare several issues that he just doesn't get. This class is a way over the top bias \ntoward the Arab end of the spectrum’(“Rate My Professors” 2015). In another \n232 | P a g e\ncase, Huffington Post Monitor, a pro-Israeli monitoring website, published a \nreport titled ‘Charles Smith Predicts the Future (and Israel's Demise)’. The \nreport starts with: ‘The latest red meat for the Huffington Post Jew haters is \nCharles Smith's article about \"Israel's fateful hour\". In it, this American \nacademic takes the bold, courageous stance of...criticizing Israeli settlements. \nSmith leads off with predictions about where the settlements will take Israel in \nthe future, predictions that as usual don't make any sense’(“Charles Smith \nPredicts the Future” 2012). The report continues with another notable \nstatement: ‘Smith then quotes more from a book he read, repeats himself about \nIsrael's imminent demise because of the settlements, describes Netanyahu as \n\"messianic\", and accuses Israel of acting like Bar Kochba, the Jewish revolt \nleader famous for committing suicide rather than surrendering to the \nRomans’(“Charles Smith Predicts the Future” 2012).\nIn 2004 Smith acted as commentator for a panel on the Israeli attack on the \nUSS Liberty at a conference held by the US State Department. He made a mild \ncritique of the Israeli attack; in relation to Israel’s claim that Liberty was \nmistaken for an Egyptian ship, Smith stressed that Israel should have \nrecognized the identity of the American vessel. He concluded that ‘If they didn't \nknow, they didn't try hard enough to find out’(UA News Services 2004).\nTessler, Mark:\nMark Tessler, an American academic, is the author of another textbook \nselected; ‘A History of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict’. He completed his \neducation in the USA, and received his PhD from NorthWestern University in \nPolitical Science. He also had chances to study in Israel and in Arab countries; \nTessler studied in The University of Tunis, and received a Certificate of North \nAfrican Sociology (1964-1965). He also studied in The Hebrew University of \nJerusalem in Israel (1961-1962). Tessler served in this university as a research \nassociate in political science in 1982. He stayed in Israel more than three years. \nHe served as a research associate at the University of Tunis (1972-1973) as \nwell. His knowledge of relevant languages includes ‘good Hebrew’ and ‘some \nArabic’(“Vita” 2014). Tessler is considered as one of the very few American \n233 | P a g e\nscholars who has studied and lived in both the Arab world and Israel(“Mark A. \nTessler” 2015). \nTessler has taught in various American universities as a professor of Political \nScience; the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, the University of Arizona and \nthe University of Michigan. He has taught a number of courses including Politics \nand International Relations of the Middle East and North Africa, the Arab-Israeli \nConflict, and Literature and Politics in North Africa. He has been appointed to \nnumerous academic posts including:\n Director of the Centre for International Studies, 1991-1999 (University of \nWisconsin-Milwaukee)\n Director of the Centre for Middle Eastern Studies, 1999-2001 (University \nof Arizona)\n Director of the International Institute, 2005-2010 (University of Michigan)\nTessler has also occupied some national positions in the area of \nIsraeli/Palestine studies; He served the Association for Israel Studies on the \nBoard of Directors (1985-present), as Vice-President (1987-1989), and as \nPresident (1989-1991). He is a member of the Editorial Board of the \nassociation’s journal, ‘Israel Studies’. Tessler is, also, a member of the Steering \nCommittee of the Palestinian American Research Centre(“Vita” 2014). He has \nresearched and written extensively on the Middle East and the Israel/Palestine \nquestion:\n Israel, Egypt, and the Palestinians: From Camp David to Intifada (co\u0002authored with Ann Lesch)\n Democracy, War, and Peace in the Middle East (as co-editor)\n Area Studies and Social Science: Strategies for Understanding Middle \nEast Politics (editor)\nHis selected book, A History of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict, attained national \nhonour, and was named by The New York Times as a ‘Notable Book of \n1994’(“Vita” 2014). The American Institute for Maghreb Studies (AIMS) awards \na prize to students in Maghrib studies, that is called ‘The Mark Tessler AIMS \nGraduate Student Prize Award’ for what is described as being ‘in honor of his \n234 | P a g e\nenduring interest in the Maghreb and his sustained efforts to develop graduate \nstudents prepared to work in the field’(“AIMS Newsletter” 2009).\nCampus Watch published an article, under ‘Middle East studies in the News’ \ntitled ‘The Clash over Middle East Studies: Critics say the programs are biased \nagainst U.S. foreign policy and need a review board’. This article written by \nJennifer Jacobson, and published originally in ‘Chronicle of Higher Education’ \nreports a discussion on the subject. In this discussion, Kramer, a well-known \npro-Israeli activist and writer, charges Middle East professors with discouraging \nscholarly work on terrorism and Islamic fundamentalism. Tessler, an attendee at \nthis discussion, opposed Kramer’s claim by mentioning some book titles \npublished by Indiana University Press including ‘Islamic Activism’. He concludes \nhis response to the Kramer charges; ‘The notion that [these centers] are not \ndoing their job and that they're soft on terrorism and anti-Israel that is just not \nthe case in my experience’(Jacobson 2004).\nIn another report, published by the pro-Israeli organization, CAMERA, which \nhas been written to critique a radio series, ‘A Middle East History’, presented \nunder a radio program, The World, Tessler is criticized; ‘The PRI series relies \nheavily on interviews with historian Mark Tessler from the University of \nMichigan, hardly an impartial scholar. A review of his 1994 book, A History of \nthe Israeli-Palestinian Conflict, pointed to Tessler’s selective citations of \ndocumentary sources, misleading quotes, one-sided reporting of facts and \nevents, biased choice of language, and even the use of a fabricated quotation \nattributed to Israel’s then military chief of staff, Yitzchak Rabin. The review \nconcluded that Tessler’s work presents only the version of events most \ndamaging to Israel, doing \"so much to promote myth and so little to advance the \ntruth\" (Midstream Magazine, May-June 1999). The same can be said to sum up \nThe World’s special series on the history of the Middle East’(Hollander 2002).\nThe Results:\nThe information that has just been provided about the background of the \nproducers of the most adopted textbooks, in Western universities, for teaching \nthe history of Israel/Palestine question, reveals some notable results as follows:\n235 | P a g e\n All writers/editors of the selected textbooks come from a particular \nnational background; they are either American or Israeli, or both: \nKlausner, Smith and Tessler are American; Morris and Rubin are Israeli; \nLaqueur and Sachar have, probably, both citizenships. Laqueur was an \nIsraeli citizen who moved to the US, and Sachar was an American citizen \nwho moved to Israel. The only exception is Bickerton; he is an Australian \nwith Irish roots. He, however, has strong links with the US; he received \nhis PhD in the US, and taught in American universities for a long time. \nHis selected textbook, is also co-authored with a Jewish American writer. \nNone of the writers/editors of these dominant textbooks come from a \nPalestinian or Arab background.\n All producers of the textbooks selected come from a particular \neducational environment; they are educated in the USA or Israel or both; \nthere are two who received part of their higher education in other \ncountries; Bickerton did his undergraduate work in Australia, and Morris \nreceived his PhD in the UK. The information provided suggests that none \nof them received any part of their education in a Middle Eastern or Arab \ncountry. The only exception is Tessler, who studied about one year in \nTunis.\n The information provided about the languages that writers can use \nsuggests that 6 of them (Klausner, Laqueur, Morris, Rubin, Sachar and \nTessler) have good Hebrew. In contrast, there is only one (Tessler) who \nhas only ‘some Arabic’. This fact can reveal how Arab and Israeli sources \nare being treated differently while writing the selected histories on the \nIsrael/Palestine question.\n All historians come from a particular religious background; they are either \nJewish or Christians; five historians, from eight, come from a Jewish \nbackground including Klausner, Laqueur, Morris, Rubin and Sachar. \nBickerton introduces ‘Irish Catholicism’ as his background. No evidence \nwas found that introduces the other two, Smith and Tessler, as Jews. \nThey probably come from a Christian background. There is certainly not \nanyone who comes from a Muslim background. There is evidence that \nintroduces all Jewish historians of the study (five in total) as having some \nrecord of supporting Zionist ideas and/or Israel. The non-Jewish \nhistorians of this study (three in total) had a greater link with Israel, \n236 | P a g e\ncompared to their link with Arab countries; they have a noticeable record, \nas has been detailed in this chapter, of living, studying and teaching in \nIsrael.\n The non-Jewish historians of the study, Smith and Tessler, are criticized \nfor the views they offer on the Israel/Palestine question, by pro-Israeli \norganizations such as Campus Watch and CAMERA. Bickerton, who co\u0002authored his book with a Jewish scholar, is the only non-Jew who \nescaped such criticism. Nothing has been found, in Campus Watch or \nCAMERA records, of such an attack on their Jewish counterparts who \nfeature in this study.\n237 | P a g e\nTable 11: A summary of the results of the context analysis 145\nAuthor Nationality Religion Education Language146 Israel147\nBickerton Australian Christian Australia/US No Arabic?\nNo Hebrew?\nTeaching \nin Israel\nKlausner American Jewish US Hebrew Pro\u0002Israeli\nLaqueur Israeli/\nAmerican\nJewish Israel Hebrew Pro\u0002Israeli\nMorris Israeli Jewish Israel/UK Hebrew Pro\u0002Israeli\nRubin Israeli Jewish US Hebrew Pro\u0002Israeli\nSachar Israeli/\nAmerican\nJewish US Hebrew Pro\u0002Israeli\nSmith American Christian US No Arabic\nNo Hebrew\nTeaching \nin Israel\nTessler American Christian US Hebrew\nSome Arabic\nLived in \nIsrael\n \n145 This table is designed to show an overall picture of the results of the context analysis that was \napplied to 8 relevant historians.

The controversy about the idea and the \nextent to which the West supports Israel, however, exists in numerous areas of \nWestern treatment of Israel which have not been explored yet. This study is \ndesigned to extend knowledge of the question by mounting an investigation into \nWestern academic knowledge in relation to the Israel/Palestine question, \nallowing us to establish the depth and scope of Western support (of Israel) in \nthe knowledge produced in the West about the question. Does the academic \nknowledge produced in the West, about the Israel/Palestine question, show the \nsame pro-Israeli bias that Western products in some other areas, including the \nmass media and cinema, exhibit?\nThe treatment of Israel in Western academia is regarded as a fascinating \nsubject for an academic examination for more than one reason; firstly, it can \ncontribute to advancing a more inclusive notion about the idea of Western \nsupport of Israel, and its real dimensions, by covering another area of the \nWestern map of pro-Israeli bias; secondly, it addresses a question which can \nreveal relevant points about the causes of such a tendency in Western policy. \nThis case is related to the leading role that knowledge plays in social and\npolitical affairs. Thirdly, Western knowledge on the question is important not \nonly for its impact on Western societies; it can occupy a dominant position, like \nmany other bodies of knowledge that come from the West, across a worldwide \nspectrum. Its capacity to inform a much wider audience in the world makes its \nimpact on the question important on a global scale. Fourthly, knowledge \noccupies an important place in the West, and is considered the main reason for \nWestern progress and the development that makes the region significant now, \nas a different and prominent part of the world. This achievement is introduced \nas an outcome of successful efforts to detach knowledge from political and \nreligious influences. Any possibility of undermining this fundamental quality in \nWestern society can be a serious matter of investigation.\n239 | P a g e\nKnowledge produced in the West on the Israel/Palestine question can be found \nin almost all the human sciences and disciplines. There is no way that a single \npiece of research of this size can cover all of them. History, as an academic \ndiscipline, is selected to constitute the precise subject area of this analysis. This \nchoice is informed by the idea that the history of the Israel/Palestine question is \na main academic field where pro-Israeli activities can be observed. Since \nIsrael’s occupation of historical Palestine depends on the argument that History \ngives the Jewish people a right to Palestine as the Promised Land, then how \nthe Palestine question is represented in History texts is a vital area of enquiry; \nHistory, in this sense, is a main source of the arguments and evidence to \ndefend Israel’s occupation of historical Palestine.\nThe first methodological question of the research emerges when access to the \nrelevant knowledge is at stake; is there any site where such knowledge can be \naccessed? The relevant literature suggests textbooks, encyclopaedia articles \nand journal articles as the main sources of knowledge. Textbooks are \nintroduced, at the same time, as a resource with a governing position. This was \nthe main reason for calling textbook knowledge an official or dominant form of \nknowledge. The second methodological question of the research is related to \ntextbooks that can represent Western knowledge on the question’s history. \nHistory of the Israel/Palestine question is taught in many courses across \nWestern universities. Many books are introduced in these courses as the main \nsource of the relevant knowledge. An extensive survey was conducted to find \nthe most frequently adopted textbooks that are used in Western universities to \nteach the history of the question. This survey allowed the formation of a list of \nthe most commonly used textbooks in Western academia, six of which, the \nleading ones, are selected for the main analysis of this study. One chapter (the \nthird chapter) of this thesis is devoted to the relevant evidence and arguments \nthat support the selected textbooks’ status as truly representative of Western \nknowledge in this area. The following list reflects the results, exhibiting a \ntextbook’s position:\n1. Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict: A History with Documents (by \nCharles D Smith)\n2. A Concise History of the Arab-Israeli Conflict (by Ian J. Bickerton and \nCarla L. Klausner)\n240 | P a g e\n3. Righteous Victims: a History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict (by Benny \nMorris)\n4. A History of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict (by Mark A. Tessler)\n5. A History of Israel: From the Rise of Zionism to Our Time (by Howard M. \nSachar)\n6. The Arab-Israeli Reader: A Documentary History of the Middle East \nConflict (by Walter Laqueur and Barry Rubin)\nIn advance of the main analysis of the study, that of textbook analysis, the \nrelated literature is reviewed; all works, about 36 titles, that are produced to \nanalyse the textbook treatment of the question, in Western countries, are \nincluded in that review. There are many studies that deal partly, and through \nwider targets such as the Middle East or the Arabs, with the question, but only \ntwo investigations were explored that were designed exclusively to conduct an \nempirical textbook analysis of the Israel/Palestine question; one on US \ntextbooks and another on Swedish ones. Another result of this review \ndemonstrates that all textbooks analysed in those investigations are school \ntextbooks. No research was found that analysed textbooks that are used at the \ncollege level. Furthermore, empirical studies in the field relied, while analysing \nschool textbooks, on college textbooks as authoritative sources of relevant \nknowledge. The college textbook’s status as a true source of relevant \nknowledge is taken for granted. No research went further into the question of \nthe knowledge offered in college textbooks. Chapter 2 of this thesis presented \nthe detailed findings of this review, and its concluding remarks.\nThe results of the studies identified in the literature review introduce bias as a \nmain problem; two studies support the idea that textbooks are suffering from an \nanti-Israeli bias. Others support the opposite. This review suggests that history \ntextbooks are deconstructed through different critical methods. Historical \nnarrative analysis, the method taken for the main analysis in this research, \nfocuses on the textbook (or any other history) as a whole rather than on its \nparts. The stress, in this analysis, has moved away from portrayal of distinct \nhistorical ‘facts’ to how the whole history is presented, or how the mega story is \nstructured. It engages with the central structure of the narrative. It is revealed \nthat such a structure comes from the main ideological positions that historians \ntake towards history. This structure can convey the principal message of the \n241 | P a g e\nconstructed history, and refers to the main reason a given history is written. \nWith this method in the centre of the analysis, identifying a pro-Israeli structure \nin the analysed histories was a main target. Other possible targets including \nfinding cases of error, or of true or false statements, or disproving what pro\u0002Israeli history claims is outside the main realm of this investigation.\nA model of a Zionist/pro-Israeli structure of the history of the question is \nrecognized in the relevant literature. Israel/Zionist historiography structures the \nrelevant history as such to support the Zionist claim to the land. This \nconstruction has explicit targets:\n• Proving the historical Jewishness of the land\n• Disregarding other historical choices of Jewish land/s outside Palestine\n• Suppressing Arab history of the land\nThe history of the question is structured, as follows, in a way to secure the \nabove Zionist historiographical goals:\n• It has a certain beginning: The history of the land starts with the Jews’ \npresence in the land, ignoring others who possessed the land before them,\n• The supposed Jewish time of possession of the land, that of ancient \nIsrael, is constructed as the main history of the land: it is narrated, also, in a \nway to provide the essentials of a Jewish state; such as ‘Jewish people’, \n‘Jewish kingdom’, and ‘Jewish independence’,\n• This ‘glorious Jewish time’ has a certain ending; the forced expulsion of \nthe Jews from the land by the Romans, is articulated as the ending of the \n‘Jewish state’, and the main event responsible for the absence of the Jews in \nthe land for the last two millennia,\n• The main bulk of the land’s history, the last 2000 years, that constitutes, \nalmost, the whole documented history of the land is not taken as a significant \nperiod in its history; the main history of this time, according to the Zionist \nhistoriography, is located outside Palestine where Jews lived, who supposedly \nregarded Palestine as their homeland; their history is summarised simply as \n242 | P a g e\ntheir efforts to keep the link with the mother land, their hoping to return to it, and \ntheir striving to realize that hope.\nAccordingly, the land’s history is structured in a way that starts with the Jews, \nand ends with them, and leaves no space in between, in the land’s thousands of \nyears of history that might be filled by others’ history. This structure secures a \nhistory - long Jewishness of the land, providing a safe historiographical place for \nthe Jews where they are not bothered by others’ presence, history and rights. At \nthe same time, all Jews of different nationalities and races in all times are taken \nas one; one ethnos, and one nation. Consequently, when a Jew migrates to \nIsrael, from any part of the world, be he of any race and colour, with any \nnationality, he is regarded as the same Jew in ancestry as he who, supposedly, \nwas forced to leave the Holy Land 2000 years ago.\nWith a model of a pro-Israeli structure at hand, all selected histories of the \nIsrael/Palestine question, have been put under extensive investigation, through \nhistorical narrative analysis, to identify the central structure of these histories in \nrelation to the pro-Israeli model. One selected textbook (The Arab-Israeli \nReader) is examined briefly but exempted from the main analysis. The entire \nbook is merely a collection of relevant documents that are organized in \nchronological order. There is no place for actual historiography in this book \neven to cover some common properties of a textbook such as ‘Introduction’ or \n‘Conclusion’. Very little is written by the editors of the book, Walter Laqueur and \nBarry Rubin, to narrate the Israel/Palestine history; a few lines are added in \nsome cases to introduce the document. As a result, no real historiography can \nbe found in its exact sense. This leaves not much chance of examining how the \nhistory of the question is written. For that reason, the results of the main \nanalysis (the next paragraph) come from examination of 5 other textbooks.\nThe textbook analysis supports the conclusion that all analysed textbooks have, \nmore or less, a pro-Israeli structure. Significant differences, however, exist; all \nhistories of the land start with the Jewish people. ‘Palestine and the Arab-Israeli \nConflict’ is the only exception that starts the question’s history with the \nCanaanites. This textbook is the only one, as well, that challenges the main \nnarratives about ancient Israel. It mentions the results of archaeological \ndiscoveries in the Holy Land that do not provide evidence to support the biblical \n243 | P a g e\nstories of ancient Israel. Other textbooks do not question the main elements of \nthe Zionist historiography of this time such as the Jewish people, the Jewish \nkingdom and Jewish independence. Some of them, Righteous Victims for \ninstance, deal with this aspect of the question very briefly, others such as \nTessler’s textbook, support this history with many details. \nThe second element of the Zionist historiography, the forced expulsion of the \nJews, is accepted as a historical fact in all textbooks. Varying degrees of \nconfirmation, however, are exercised. ‘Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict’ is \nthe only account which does not support, openly, a mass expulsion of all Jews \nby the Romans but it confirms, at the same time, the general idea of expulsion, \nand that Jews left the Holy Land because of Roman policy. Others do not \nchallenge this story; one textbook, A Concise History of the Arab-Israeli Conflict, \nhowever, presents the idea that many Jews left the land, voluntarily, before the \nexpulsion.\nIn relation to another element of Zionist historiography, the Jews’ link, outside \nPalestine, with Palestine as a homeland and their redemptionist efforts to \nreturn, textbooks do not reject this story but take different positions towards this \nidea; again, ‘Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict’ is the only one that shows a \nvery limited sympathy with this Zionist account, providing the idea that the \nreligious traditions expressed by Jews in the pre-Zionist era about a final \ngathering in Zion are different from the Zionist ideas about the return to \nPalestine as a national home. In contrast, Morris considers Zionism as a \nmodern version of the old Jewish yearning to return to their home in Palestine. \nSachar makes more effort, relatively, to support this Zionist idea. Others, \nTessler and Bickerton (and Klausner), provide some arguments to support the \nidea, mentioning, at the same time, that no actual step has been taken by Jews \nin this period, almost 2000 years, to make that ‘return’ happen. \nThe selected textbooks demonstrate different treatments when the Arab history \nof the land is at stake; Sachar and Morris, not only ignore the significance of the \nArab history of the land but make clear efforts to suppress it. Smith and \nTessler, on the other hand, take the Arab history of the land into consideration. \nBickerton (and Klausner) ignore the history but make no effort to downgrade it. \n244 | P a g e\nAll of them, at the same time, do not take the Arab history of the land as its \nprincipal history.\nThere are, also, other cases of accepting pro-Israeli elements: all textbooks \nsupport the Zionist idea of regarding Jews as one people, as a nation. All of \nthem regard the European Jews, from different nationalities, as the same Jews \nwho, supposedly, were expelled from the land, 2000 years ago. All of them \nignore Jewish links to other lands, and their achievements in establishing \nindependent states outside Palestine. One, Bickerton & Klausner, ‘A Concise \nHistory of the Arab-Israeli Conflict’, rejects such a possibility. None of the \ntextbooks analysed in this research regard the pro-Israeli structure of the \ndominant histories of the question as a real problem to understanding the \nIsrael/Palestine question.\nThe overall results of this analysis introduce ‘Palestine and the Arab-Israeli \nConflict’ as the only textbook that entertained considerable reservations about \nsome main elements of the Zionist historiography, and that has not accepted, \nuncritically, the pro-Israeli structure of the history. All others failed to do this. \nTwo different classes, at the same time, can be identified in this category; two \ntextbooks, those written by Sachar and Morris, reproduced all the main \nelements of the Zionist historiography without distancing themselves from them. \nThe other two, however, managed to show some distance between their own \nposition and that of the pro-Israeli narrative in some cases. As a result, this \nanalysis does not regard these two as histories that were developed to advance \nthe Zionist version of history, but as histories that have been influenced heavily \nby that history.\nFour arguments can support the idea that textbook knowledge on the \nIsrael/Palestine question in the West is biased; the first one is based directly on \nthe results of the main analysis of the research. All histories analysed, except \none, have a pro-Israeli structure. This structure is a common character of all \nZionist historiographies of the question. And it is rooted in fundamental Zionist \ndocuments including Israel’s Declaration of Independence, as elaborated in \nChapter 4.\n245 | P a g e\nThe second argument is related to another aspect of the identified structure i.e. \nits origin. This structure/mega story is invented by Zionist historians in the 19th\ncentury. It is a recent phenomenon, and has no precedent in history, and \nhistorical sources of the pre-Zionist era. It was constructed when the Zionist \nmovement needed such a construction to advance its ideology. \nThe first argument bases the main claim, the identified bias, on an answer to \nthe question of how a Zionist history of the Israel/Palestine matter is narrated. \nThe second one is based on a different question: when has such history been \nnarrated, and by whom. Answers delivered necessitate a scholarly sensitivity to \nthe political motivations responsible for such narratives, and their grave \nconsequences for the Zionist historiography of the question. All selected \nhistories are found free of such sensitivity. Uncritical acceptance of the Zionist \nnarratives, in such circumstances, is far from an objective historiography. \nThe fourth argument that supports the biased character of Western knowledge \non the question is related to the historical and scientific value of the Zionist \nhistoriographical elements. There are serious problems, as revealed by critical \nIsraeli historians, which undermine, severely, the historicity of the Zionist \naccounts. The main elements of the Zionist history, including those that are \nrelated to ancient Israel, the forced expulsion of the Jews and their \nredemptionist efforts to return, suffer from such problems. There is not enough \nevidence to introduce them as historical facts; this has been elaborated in \nChapter 4. There is evidence, in fact, that disproves such theories. It is not \nexpected from an unbiased history to represent them as historical facts. An \nunbiased history makes enough effort to differentiate between myth and fact, \nand to place what can be categorised as not strictly either, in its correct position. \nThe way the history of the question is presented in the selected textbooks is \nquite different; Zionist historical elements are reported as the true history of the \nquestion. Nothing serious is mentioned to reflect the real problems with these \naccounts. The only real exception is the textbook written by Charles Smith.\nAt odds with the documented bias of the selected textbooks, they make evident \nefforts to market their work as objective and unbiased products. For such \npurpose, they frequently stress that both the Israeli and Palestinian sides and \ntheir arguments are taken into (equal) consideration in narrating the related \n246 | P a g e\nhistory. All six selected textbooks, except one (A History of Israel), offered such \nassertions in the book’s opening section, the Preface or Introduction. Bickerton \nand Klausner presented their own statement in the Preface of the book: ‘We \nhave attempted to achieve some balance and objectivity about a subject upon \nwhich most people feel it necessary to adopt a partisan point of view. \nThroughout the book, we have tried to present both sides of the issues, \nalthough we realize that even the selection of material to be included reveals \nsome subjective judgment on our part’ (Bickerton and Klausner 1998, xvi).\nBenny Morris made a similar claim in the Preface to his textbook as well: ‘I have \ntried to compensate by using relevant Arab materials to the extent that they \nwere accessible, and by ferreting out the \"Arab side\" or \"perspective\" as \nmanifested in documentation in Zionist-Israeli and Western archives (for \nexample, by using intelligence documents reporting on thinking and activities \nfrom the Arab side) and writings. In doing so, I have attempted to approach the \nsubject as objectively as possible, to bring reason and fairness to my \nreconstructions of the past’ (Morris 2001, xiv). Laqueur and Rubin, the editors of \nthe ‘Israel-Arab Reader’ made such a claim in brief in the Introduction of their \ntextbook; ‘For four decades, The Israel-Arab Reader has tried to document \nthese developments as objectively as possible’(Laqeuer and Rubin 2008, xiv).\nTessler, especially, is detailed in describing the ‘unbiased’ character of his \ntextbook; ‘This book seeks not only to provide an objective history of the Israeli\u0002Palestinian conflict but also to encourage an engaged and sympathetic \nunderstanding of the parties to this continuing dispute. The aim of this approach \nmay be described as objectivity without detachment’ (Tessler 2009, xiv). This \nclaim has been emphasised again in the book; ‘Second, and consistent with this \nperspective, the book seeks not only to present a balanced and accurate history \nof the Israel-Palestinian conflict, it also strives to encourage a sympathetic \nunderstanding of the parties involved’ (Tessler 2009, xiii). Tessler made \nenormous efforts to stress the objectivity of his work and its fair representation \nof both sides; ‘Beyond this, however, my aim has been to maintain a stance of \nconsidered objectivity. I have tried to represent both sides fairly when \nfundamental issues are discussed’(Tessler 2009, xvii). He claims further that no \nconclusion is advanced by the book; it is left to the readers to make their own: \n‘….the volume strives for a nonpartisan point of view; it seeks to present both \nPalestinian and Israeli analyses and to enable readers to form their own \n247 | P a g e\nconclusions about the persuasiveness of competing arguments’(Tessler 2009, \nxvii). This is stressed again in the opening of the book: ‘My goal is not to foster \nspecific conclusions about central issues in the conflict but to provide a basis for \nunderstanding and evaluating the actions of both Israelis and \nPalestinians’(Tessler 2009, xvii). It is quite illuminating that the most humble \nclaim about the book’s unbiased character and its capacity for true \nrepresentation of both sides is made by the least biased book of the survey, \n‘Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict’; ‘From its inception, this book has given \nequal emphasis to the modern histories of both Palestine and Israel, beginning \nwith extended treatment of the nineteenth century, the critical era of World War \nI, and the period of British mandatory rule down to 1947 as points of departure \nfor the era since Israel’s independence’(C. D. Smith 2013, VI). The\ndemonstrated pattern in the other selected textbooks, laying emphasis on \nobjectivity when the book is biased, and stressing fair representation of both \nsides while the book is pro-Israeli, leads to the conclusion that such claims are \nnot only untrue but also misleading. It also suggests the idea that such stress \nand emphasis might be made deliberately to sell a pro-Israeli product as a non\u0002partisan and reliable source of the related knowledge.\nA further analysis of the selected textbooks, from the perspective of the authors’ \nbackground, supports the results of the main analysis (textbook analysis) of the \nthesis. The second analysis went further, to ascertain the context of the texts \nproduced, to provide some knowledge about why the selected histories are \nconstructed in that particular way. Historians (the authors) have been chosen as \nthe most influential factors in the social context of textbook authorship, for their \nsignificant role in how a college-level textbook is written. They are the main \nauthority that determines textbook contents. This second analysis has provided \na conclusion that pro-Israeli textbooks are written by historians who come from \na pro-Israeli background. This is evident in two pro-Israeli textbooks of this \nstudy i.e. Sachar and Morris, both from a pro-Israeli Jewish background. Other \ntextbooks, which showed less pro-Israeli bias, originate in a different \nbackground. \nThis analysis offers other significant results: All writers/editors of the six \nselected textbooks come from a certain national background; they are either \n248 | P a g e\nAmerican or Israeli, or both: Klausner, Smith and Tessler are American; Morris \nand Rubin are Israeli; Laqueur and Sachar have, probably, both citizenships. \nThe only exception is Bickerton, an Australian historian. None of them come \nfrom a Palestinian or Arab national background. All producers of the popular \ntextbooks come from a certain educational environment; they are educated in \nthe USA or Israel or both; there are only two who received part of their higher \neducation in other countries i.e. in Australia and the UK. None of them received \nany major part of their education in a Middle Eastern or Arab country. The \nlanguage used, in the relevant studies, is another source of bias: 6 of the \nhistorians (Klausner, Laqueur, Morris, Rubin, Sachar and Tessler) have good \nHebrew. In contrast, there is only one (Tessler) who has ‘some Arabic’. All \nhistorians come from a particular religious background; they are either Jewish \nor Christian; five historians, from eight, come from a Jewish background \nincluding Klausner, Laqueur, Morris, Rubin and Sachar. There is not, even, one \nwho comes from a different religious background. The related evidence \nintroduces all Jewish historians of the study (five in total) as having some record \nof supporting Zionist ideas and/or Israel. The non-Jewish historians of this study \n(three in total) do not have such a background, but they still have a greater link \nwith Israel, compared to their link with Arab countries. The non-Jewish \nhistorians of the study, Smith and Tessler, are criticized for the views they offer \non the Israel/Palestine question, by pro-Israeli organizations such as Campus \nWatch and CAMERA. Bickerton, who co-authored his book with a Jewish \nscholar, is the only non-Jew who escaped such criticism. Nothing has been \nfound, in Campus Watch or CAMERA records, of such an attack on their Jewish \ncounterparts who feature in this study.\nThe main analyses of this study, textbook analysis and context analysis, have \nbeen conducted to provide some answers to the questions of ‘how’ and ‘why’ in \nthe research: ‘How the knowledge of history of the Israel/Palestine question is \npresented in Western academia, and why it has been presented in that \nparticular way’. The results of the first analysis, textbook analysis, support the \nclaim that the textbook knowledge on the question is mainly pro-Israeli in bias. \nIn relation to the question “why”, the analysis offers the ‘Jewish pro-Israeli \nproducer’ as the main factor that can explain that bias in the products. Another \nfactor is identified in this analysis as well; the relevant knowledge has been \n249 | P a g e\nproduced in a particular, American or Israeli, national and educational \nenvironment. One needs to take into consideration that the US is the most pro\u0002Israeli country in the world, to grasp the real dimensions of the social, national, \nand educational environments that govern the production of these textbooks. It \nis equally significant to take into account the fact that there is no place in that \ncontext for the views of the other side, the Arabs, or the views of less pro-Israeli \ncountries in the West as influences on the related processes. This thesis \nsupports the idea that the dominant knowledge in Western academia, on the \nhistory of the Israel/Palestine question, is produced under the influence of an \nIsraeli/American context.\nThe findings of this study can open a discussion about the grave consequences \nthat such a state of affairs can have at the practical level. Knowledge itself can \nbe regarded as the first victim. Western knowledge is credited with being \nobjective and dispassionate when compared with other bodies of knowledge in \nthe world. The results of this study might undermine this idea; it is quite \npoliticized when it comes to Israel. This problem cannot be discounted as an \nunavoidable social bias that no one/society can escape; it is involved in \nundermining a fundamental quality of Western knowledge; Western knowledge \nflourished when the fundamentalist religious ideas about the world were \nabandoned by scholars who replaced them with a scientific and objective \nmethod of producing knowledge. This tradition is still powerful in the West and \ngoverns its academia. The results of this study demonstrate that Western \nknowledge, when it comes to the Israel/Palestine question, is influenced heavily \nby the fundamental ideas of the biblical stories. These stories, in the history of \nthe question, are taken as scientific facts as shown in the analysis.\nEducation is another area of practical consequences for the results of this \nresearch. Textbooks are taken, in this study, to represent knowledge but they \ncan represent education as well. Some relevant points made in the first chapter, \nthat introduce the textbook as a central player in education, are recalled here; \nThe relevant literature supports the argument that instructors rely on and \nbelieve in textbooks as “the principal source of knowledge” (S. Foster 2006b, \n157). Students, who are the main consumers of this medium, commonly regard \na textbook’s content as ‘important’ and ‘true’. Textbooks occupy a dominant \n250 | P a g e\nposition in educational activities; one source (Airasian 1994, 793) refers to ‘up \nto 75 percent’ as a figure which represents the proportion of influence assumed \nby the textbook in those activities. There are many references to its position as \n‘dominant’ and its influence as ‘profound’ in education (for instance Buckingham \n1960, 1518; S. Foster 2006b, 157). The textbook appears closer than any other \neducational tool to assuming the position of determining what students learn. It \ncontributes significantly to shaping their views about the world (S. Foster 2006a, \nix). In doing so, textbooks approach the position similar to that of a “holy book”. \nThey place the presented knowledge above suspicion as religious rituals do \n(Keith Crawford 2003b, 48). Furthermore, their status as a textbook is \ndetermined by a hierarchy in education. As a result, the findings of this study \ncan support the idea of a pro-Israeli treatment of the question in Western higher \neducation. The results of the literature review suggest that the situation in lower \nlevel education, schools, is worse. Some studies of that level introduce the \nschool textbooks as pro-Israeli biased when compared with the dominant \nscholarly works, accepted in these studies as objective knowledge.\nThe presented ideas about the dominant role of textbooks in education can \nrefer to the fact that the consequences of a pro-Israeli textbook can be grave. \nThey reveal what knowledge students receive about the Israel/Palestine \nquestion. This, in turn, can exhibit the influential power of certain powerful elites \nto manipulate knowledge of the question. It can display how scientific \nknowledge is undermined by political and ideological motivations. It exhibits \nhow the governing standards of teaching history are damaged in this case, \nwhere differentiating idea from fact is articulated as a main objective; ‘There are \nsome objectives assumed for teaching history such as: knowledge and facts, \nunderstanding, and critical thinking to realize the difference between fact and \nidea’(Blishen 1969 History, teaching of).\nTextbook knowledge does not only influence students; it has a wider impact on \nsociety as a whole. This case constitutes the third level of the practical \nconsequences of biased knowledge. Textbook knowledge has a profound \nimpact on social beliefs and ideas. This influence is compared, in this sense, \nwith that of holy books. Historical knowledge, compared with other bodies of \nknowledge, has a particular power, enabling it to play a central role in society; \n251 | P a g e\npresenting the past through history contributes significantly to controlling the \npresent and shaping the future (S. Foster and Crawford 2006, 6). What people \nreceive and believe as the past is able to produce huge social energy; it can \nmake people die for a cause or kill for it (S. Foster and Crawford 2006, 6). \nPublic opinion is informed and formed by knowledge. Public opinion is \ntranslated into public policy in democracies. Holsti makes a valuable \ncontribution in this field through his idea of the ‘belief system’(Holsti 1962). This \nsystem determines, he argues, how leaders take decisions and develop a \npolicy, foreign policy for instance; \n‘In a democracy, leaders must be responsive to the views of their \nconstituents and thus, leaders’ belief systems are linked with those of \nthe public. For example: if the people of the United States believe \nthat inhabitants of the Middle East are terrorists, the people will \nsupport policies within the U.S. that reflect that, and they will be \nunlikely to support aid and policies friendly towards the Middle East. \nEven enlightened leaders will have to respond to these demands or \nface electoral defeat. Thus the belief systems of ordinary people are \ncrucial to understand’(Brockway 2007, 4).\nHolsti elaborates how this national state is related to international conflicts: ‘The \nrelationship of national images to international conflict is clear: decision-makers \nact upon their definition of the situation and their images of states — others as \nwell as their own. These images are in turn dependent upon the decision\u0002makers’ belief system. And these may or may not be accurate representations \nof “reality’(Holsti 1962). He concludes that for resolving conflicts it is necessary \nto correct the erroneous image of others. This theory can explain how biased \nknowledge on the Israel/Palestine question can form biased and erroneous \npublic opinion. This biased public opinion, in turn, will influence Western policy \ntowards the question.\nThe findings of this thesis suggest some points on the theoretical level; this \nstudy, as mentioned earlier, is conducted to test the theory of Western support \nof Israel in a novel area i.e. knowledge. The results support the conclusion that \nWestern treatment of the question in this field, academic knowledge, is biased, \nas it is in other areas of Western treatment of the question that have been \n252 | P a g e\ninvestigated by earlier studies. How the impact of biased knowledge works in \neducation and in wider public opinion has just been mentioned: it influences \nWestern policy towards the Israel/Palestine question. As a result, this case of \nbiased Western treatment, the biased knowledge, has the capacity to work as \nan explanatory factor for the whole problem as well; it might explain why the \nWest supports Israel. This enables this study to propose, while not proving it, a \ntheory in this regard; biased knowledge is the main reason, or one of the most \nimportant reasons, for the support of Israel by Western countries.\nAnother theoretical implication of the results of this research is related to \nWestern knowledge. This study confirms that Western knowledge on the \nquestion is biased. This might be attributed to a general problem in History, as \nan academic discipline, and the Social Sciences, where all historical narratives \nin general and national histories in particular are considered biased from one \nperspective. But it might refer, also, to a bigger and particular problem. Western \nknowledge on the Israel/Palestine question might represent an exception, an \nexceptional level of bias in Western academia. This study has not been \nconducted to assess this hypothesis. Such assessment is left to those who are \nfamiliar with other areas of bias in Western knowledge including national, racial \nand sexual bias, to those who can compare different existing levels of bias in \nthe West. This study suggests, at the same time, that such a theory about a \nparticular and exceptional bias in this area of Western knowledge can be taken \ninto consideration. One finding of this study, the fundamentalist nature of the \nrelevant knowledge on Israel/Palestine history, where fundamental texts, at \nodds with the governing values of Western science, are taken as factual \nstatements, can support such a theory.\nThe last theoretical implication of this research can enforce the previous \nrelevant point i.e. the exceptional nature of Western scholarly treatment of \nIsrael. This point is related to the general theory of the relationship between the \nhistory produced and the historians, the producers. The findings of this study \nsupport the idea that historians produce histories that are in agreement with \ntheir background. Pro-Israeli historians, in this case, produced pro-Israeli \nhistories. This conclusion supports the historical theory on the relationship \nbetween history and historians. There are, however, relevant considerations \n253 | P a g e\nthat limit such support. These considerations introduce the pro-Israeli historians \nas exceptional historians and not normal ones. There are reasons for such an \nassertion; first of all pro-Israeli historians are aware that without a historical \njustification of the Zionist involvement in Palestine the whole legitimacy of Israel \nis in danger. Israel might constitute the only case in the international community \nwhose legitimacy faces such a grave challenge. Secondly, they undoubtedly\nknow that without effective Western support Israel cannot survive. Again, this is \nnot a common reality in the world. There are governments, here and there, that \nmight not survive without Western support but in Israel’s case this survival is \nrelated to the very existence of a Jewish state. The third reason is related to the \nimage that pro-Israeli scholars carry about the Jewish question and the outside \nworld. Zionism was born out of the idea that the outside world is hostile to Jews, \nand Jews need a refuge of their own to survive. The holocaust is taken by them \nas evidence that there is a powerful tendency in the world at large, to annihilate \nthe Jews as a people. They consider, accordingly, the existing resistance to the \noccupation of Palestine, as efforts by anti-Semite forces to destroy this sole \nrefuge of the Jewish people. It is understandable why, with such an image in \nmind, they promote the version of history they do. The case, for them, is a case \nof life and death. They, consequently, might use whatever is at hand to advance \na history that guarantees the survival of this only ‘sole refuge’. These \nconsiderations, hence, might differentiate them from other/normal historians. \nNormal historians produce bias when they are engaged in writing national \nhistories, for instance. It is hard, at the same time, to perceive that their \nbackground provides such extraordinary motivations for writing self-history in \nthis particular way.\n254 | P a g e\nAppendix\nTable 12: All extracted syllabi from US universities148\nNo College Course Title Course Code Access \nDate149\nTaught \nDate\n1 The University of \nTexas at Austin\nRe-Forming the 20th Century \nArab East150\nHIS 364G\nMES 322K\nMarch \n22\nSpring \n2011\n2 University of \nWisconsin\nThe Arab-Israeli Conflict151 Political \nScience 333\nMarch \n22\nSpring \n2009\n3 University of Puget \nSound\nWar and Peace in the Middle \nEast152\nIPE 180 March \n22\nFall \n2009\n4 The University of \nAlabama\nA: Multi-Ethnic Israel153 Core 174C March \n22\n2011\n5 Syracuse University The Israeli‐Palestinian Conflict:\nReligion, International Relations, \nand the Media154\nPSC 600.001\nMES \n600.001\nMarch \n22\nSpring \n2011\n6 University of Utah Introduction to the History of the \nMiddle East from 1750 to the \nPresent155\nHIST 1460\nMID E 1545\nUGS 1460\nMarch \n22\nSpring \n2012\n7 University of Virginia Government and Politics of the \nMiddle East156\nPLCP 3410 March \n22\nSummer \n2012\n8 University of \nCalifornia, San Diego\nRepresentations of the \nIsraeli/Palestinian Conflict157\nCOSF 188 March \n22\nSpring \n2011\n \n148 In this table all syllabi extracted from US universities are listed.

Israel had said it wouldn’t allow Gazans to move north after Hamas didn’t release a civilian hostage on Saturday, something that was agreed as part of the deal, according to an Israeli official.\n\nBut a breakthrough was announced early Monday.\n\nThe Israeli prime minister’s office and Qatar’s Foreign Ministry said that an agreement had been reached to soon release the Israeli hostage, Arbel Yehoud, who had been expected to be released Saturday , along with two others held in Gaza. Hamas delivered mediators an update on the status of the hostages to be released in the first stage. Twenty-five of the 33 hostages to be released in the first of the multiphase deal are alive and eight are dead, according to a person familiar with the matter. Of these, seven living hostages have already been released since the cease-fire went into effect on Jan. 19.\n\n[![]] \n\nPalestinians, who were displaced to the south at Israel’s order during the war, wait to head back to their homes in northern Gaza by vehicle through Salahudeen Road, amid a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, in the central Gaza Strip, January 27, 2025. REUTERS/Hatem Khaled TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY\n\n“Hamas backed down and will conduct another batch of releases of hostages on Thursday,” the Israeli prime minister’s office said. Three additional hostages are also slated to be released as scheduled on Saturday.\n\nWith that, the crossing was opened. Flocks of people, their belongings in-tow, traveled by foot north along the Gaza Strip’s main coastal roadway, some jubilant to re-enter northern Gaza for the first time since the war began. Some were emotional as they reunited with loved ones, and others were anxious as they searched for their own.\n\nSuha Arafat, a 47-year-old mother of six, left her home in Gaza City in the first weeks of the war, as Israel ordered more than one million Palestinians to move south. On Monday, she carried her belongings from central Gaza in her hands and her 9-year-old daughter on her back as they trudged through a sea of other displaced people heading toward Gaza City, roughly 7 miles away.\n\n“Devastation and masses of people is all I can see,” Arafat said by phone as she made her way north. “It feels like a parallel world.”\n\n[![Palestinians Gaza]] \n\nPalestinians, who were displaced to the south at Israel’s order during the war, head back to their homes in northern Gaza by vehicle through Salahudeen Road, amid a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, in the central Gaza Strip, January 27, 2025. REUTERS/Hatem Khaled\n\nThe Israeli military choked off northern Gaza from the rest of the enclave early in the war. The north was where Israel’s ground invasion began. It is home to some of the highest casualty incidents of the war . People there endured long stretches without adequate aid deliveries, resulting in a humanitarian catastrophe and widespread hunger . Northern Gaza was also the site of a ferocious Israeli campaign that began late last year, which renewed fighting in areas the Israeli military said it had previously cleared.\n\nIsrael has said much of Hamas’s presence has been concentrated in northern Gaza. The military has said that throughout the war, Hamas militants have resurfaced in areas from which Israeli troops and airstrikes had rooted them out.\n\nAs Palestinians hoped to begin rebuilding their lives in northern Gaza, President Trump said he wants to “clean out” the Gaza Strip , urging Jordan and Egypt to take in refugees either temporarily or for the long term, a move rejected by Arab countries since the war began and condemned by Palestinian leadership.\n\n“You’re talking about a million and half people, and we just clean out that whole thing,” the president told reporters on Air Force One on Saturday. “It is literally a demolition site, almost everything is demolished and people are dying there, so I’d rather get involved with some of the Arab nations and build housing at a different location where they can maybe live in peace for a change.”\n\n[![Palestinians Gaza]] \n\nPalestinians, who were displaced to the south at Israel’s order during the war, wait to head back to their homes in northern Gaza by vehicle through Salahudeen Road, amid a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, in the central Gaza Strip, January 27, 2025. REUTERS/Hatem Khaled\n\nMost of Gaza’s more than two million residents have fled their homes at least once during the 15-month-long war that began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas launched attacks on southern Israel that left about 1,200 dead and around 250 taken hostage. More than 47,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the war began, according to local health authorities, who don’t say how many were combatants.\n\nThe multiphase deal’s protocols call for female hostages—civilians and soldiers—to be released first, followed by elderly and wounded men and then the bodies of the dead. But the two sides negotiated the first phase under the expectation that Hamas would first release female civilians and then female soldiers.\n\nThat meant Israel had expected Yehoud, 29, to be among those freed on Saturday. Which hostages are released and when is hugely sensitive in Israel, where some families of captives are unsure whether their loved ones are alive or dead .\n\nThe deal also calls for hundreds of Palestinians in Israeli prisons, many of whom are being held without charge, to be released. About 290 have been released so far, including some serving life sentences, of whom 70 were handed over to Egypt. The Palestinian prisoners sent to Egypt will have the choice to stay or move to another country, mediators said.\n\nWrite to Omar Abdel-Baqui at omar.abdel-baqui@wsj.com and Anat Peled at anat.peled@wsj.com\n\n- [Cease-fire deal] \n- [Gaza] \n- [Gaza Cease Fire] \n- [Middle East] \n\nFollow tovima.com on [Google News] to keep up with the [latest stories] \n\n[![Sweden Has the Tanks.

(AP Photo/Abdel Kareem Hana)]] \nAs a[fragile ceasefire] held into a second week, Israel was told by Hamas that eight of the hostages to be freed during the deal’s first phase are dead.\n[Joyous crowds] of Palestinians, some holding babies or pushing wheelchairs, walked along a seaside road all day and into the night, carrying bedrolls, bottles of water and other belongings. Armed and masked Hamas fighters flashed a victory sign. The crowd was watched over by Israeli tanks on a nearby hill.\nThe United Nations said over 200,000 people were observed moving north on Monday morning.\nPalestinians who have been sheltering[in squalid tent camps] and former schools are eager to return to their homes —even though[they are likely damaged or destroyed]. Many had feared that Israel would[make their displacement permanent.] \nYasmin Abu Amshah, a mother of three, said she walked 6 kilometers (nearly 4 miles) to reach her damaged but habitable Gaza City home. She saw her younger sister for the first time in over a year.\n“It was a long trip, but a happy one,” she said.\nMany saw their return as an act of steadfastness after Israel’s military campaign, which was launched in response to the Hamas militant group’s Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel. The return was also seen as a repudiation of U.S.[President Donald Trump’s suggestion] that many Palestinians be resettled in Egypt and Jordan. Both countries rejected the idea.\n## Families of dead hostages are informed\nWhether hostages are still alive inside Gaza has been a heartbreaking question for waiting families who have pushed Israel’s government to reach a deal to free them, fearing that time was running out.\nBefore Monday’s announcement, Israel believed that at least 35 of the about 90 hostages taken in the Oct. 7 attack and still in Gaza were dead.\nGovernment spokesman David Mencer told journalists that a list received overnight from Hamas on the status of the 33 hostages being freed under the ceasefire’s first phase showed eight were dead.\nThe families have been informed, he said, adding that the information matched what Israeli intelligence had believed.\nThe ceasefire is aimed at winding down the deadliest and most destructive war ever fought between Israel and Hamas. Militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. 7 assault and abducted another 250.\nIsrael responded with an air and ground war that has killed over 47,000 Palestinians, over half of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. It does not say how many of the dead were combatants. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence.\nIn all, around 90% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have been displaced, and they face[new health risks] as they return.\n## ‘The joy of return’\nIsmail Abu Mattar, a father of four who waited for days near the crossing point for northern Gaza, described scenes of jubilation, with people singing, praying and crying.\n“It’s the joy of return,” said Abu Mattar, whose relatives were among the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who fled or were driven out of what is now Israel during the 1948 war surrounding its creation. “We had thought we wouldn’t return, like our ancestors.”\nIn the war’s opening days, Israel ordered the evacuation of the north and sealed it off after ground troops moved in. Around a million people fled south while hundreds of thousands remained in the north, which had some of the heaviest fighting and[the worst destruction].\nThe opening to the north was delayed for two days as Israel said Hamas had changed the order of the hostages it released in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Local medical officials said Israeli forces opened fire at the waiting crowd and killed several Palestinians over the weekend. Israel’s military said it fired warning shots at approaching groups it deemed a threat.\nMediators[resolved the dispute overnight]. Hamas called the return “a victory for our people.”\nLater Monday in central Gaza, Awda hospital said it received the body of a child killed in the Nuseirat refugee camp when returnees were hit, and three others were wounded. It said three more were wounded in a separate attack near the camp.\nIsrael’s military said one of its aircraft fired “to distance a number of suspicious vehicles” moving north in unauthorized areas. And it said it fired shots in northern Gaza to “remove” someone it deemed a threat who didn’t move away.\n## Hostage dispute rattled week-old ceasefire\nPalestinians were crossing on foot without inspection through part of[the Netzarim corridor], a military zone bisecting the territory just south of Gaza City that Israel carved out early in the war. A checkpoint for vehicles opened later on Gaza’s main north-south highway, where traffic was backed up for around 3 kilometers (2 miles).\nUnder the ceasefire agreement, vehicles are to be inspected for weapons before entering the north.\nAn Egyptian official said Egyptian contractors, along with a U.S. firm, run checkpoints that inspect vehicles heading via Salahuddin road. The contractors are part of an Egyptian-Qatari committee implementing the ceasefire, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. The contractors are cleared by Israel.\nIsrael had delayed the crossing’s opening, which was supposed to happen over the weekend, saying it would not allow Palestinians north until a civilian hostage, Arbel Yehoud, was released. Israel said she should have been released before four female soldiers who were[freed on Saturday].\nQatar, a key mediator, announced early Monday that Yehoud and two other hostages would be released by Friday. Israel said the release —which will include female soldier Agam Berger —will take place on Thursday. Another three hostages should be released on Saturday as previously planned.\nThere were mixed emotions among Israelis watching the scene in Gaza from the nearby city of Sderot. Some expressed mistrust toward the Palestinians. Others were empathetic.\n“Let them come back home safely and conduct a normal life,” said one, Rachel Osher. “We also want it. We want the same on both sides of the border.”\n\\_\\_\\_\nShurafa and Hana reported from Wadi Gaza, Gaza Strip, and Magdy from Cairo.

Thesis submitted for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at the University of Glasgow \nDepartment of Sociology, Anthropology and Applied Social Science \nSeptember 2004 \nAbstract \nThis thesis is an examination of how British television news reported on the Peace \nAccords signed between Israeli and Palestinian negotiators at the Wye River \nPlantation, Maryland USA in October 1998. The research involves three elements. \nFirstly a review of the historiography of the conflict which sketches out the range of \nviews on the history and origins of the dispute. Secondly a content analysis of the \npeace negotiations themselves. This examines how journalists drew on the range of \nviews present in the historiography in order to contextualise coverage and provide \nexplanations for the conflict. Thirdly the thesis looks at the various factors in \nproduction which influence the construction of news in this area, and links this to \ntheoretical debates in the area. \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nAcknowledgments iv \nChapter 1 Introduction \nThe Controversial Historiography of the Conflict 3 \nPrevious Research on Media Coverage of the Israel-Palestine Conflict 9 \nAmerican Research 9 \nBritish Research 19 \nRe resentations p in Popular Culture 22 \nFactors Affecting the Production of News 24 \nCommercial Imperatives 25 \nSourcing 28 \nPublic Relations 30 \nPressure, Intimidation, Censorship and the Law 34 \nNew Technology 37 \nCultural ContextslValue Systems 39 \nJournalism Training and Critical Skills 41 \nChapter 2 Histories of the Conflict \nZionist Roots and the First Wave of Jewish Immigration into Palestine 43 \nTheodore Herzl and the Emergence of Political Zionism 44 \nThe Second Wave of Jewish Immigration into Palestine 45 \nThe Balfour Declaration and the British Mandate 47 \nAmerican Politics and the Settlement of the Holocaust Survivors 55 \nThe End of the Mandate 58 \nThe United Nations Debates the Future of Palestine 59 \nThe Unofficial War 60 \nThe First Arab-Israeli War 62 \nPost War Negotiations: Peace Treaties, Borders and Refugees 64 \n1956: The Suez Conflict 69 \n1967: The Six-Day War 71 \nResolution 242 and the War of Attrition 76 \nSettlement Building, Economic Integration and the Occupation 78 \nMilitary Occupation/Administration 83 \nPalestinian Nationalism and the Rise of the Opposition Movements 85 \n1973: The October War 89 \nConflict in Lebanon 90 \nDiplomacy and the Camp David Accords 94 \n1982: The Invasion of Lebanon 97 \n1987: The First Intifada 103 \nThe Beginning of the Oslo Process 110 \nThe Declaration of Principles 112 \nThe Cairo Agreement and Oslo 11 115 \nThe Netanyahu Administration 119 \nChapter 3 Content Analysis of the Wye Accords \nIntroduction 124 \nMethodology 125 \nTheme 1: Progress of Talks/Movement of Dignitaries/ 127 \nDiscussion of America's Role in the Peace Process \nTheme 2: Explanations for the Conflict 135 \nThe Historical Origins of the Conflict 136 \nInterim Issues 139 \nLand and Security 139 \nIsrael's Security 140 \nThe Military Occupation 150 \nFinal Status Issues 152 \nSettlements 152 \nJerusalem 157 \nPalestinian Refugees 158 \nControl of Water Resources 160 \nTheme 3: The Peace Process: Effects and Implications 162 \nTheme 4: Opposition/Attitudes to the Wye Accords 165 \nSourcing and Reported Statements 169 \n'Terrorism' and Descriptions of Violence 171 \nChapter 4 Production Factors in the Reporting of the Israel-Palestine Conflict \nTime Constraints, New Technologies and Commercial Pressures 176 \nCultural Preference, Sourcing and Public Relations 178 \nPressure, Intimidation and Accusations of Anti-Semitism 184 \nPress Coverage 190 \nLack of Specialist Knowledge 191 \nBritain's 'Special Relationship' with the United States 192 \nChapter 5 Conclusion 195 \nNews Coverage and Public Belief 201 \nMedia Power and Ideological Closure 205 \nEndnotes 213 \nReferences 225 \nChapter 1 Introduction \nThe former Washington Post publisher Philip Graham famously described journalism \nas the 'first draft of history'. Recent research suggests that if anything Graham may \nactually be understating the true influence of the media. The important role played by \ntelevision news in the formation of public knowledge means that for many members \nof the public this type of journalism represents not just the 'first draft' but the only \ndraft of history. Studies have shown that approximately 80 percent of the public rely \non television news as their source of information on world news (Committee on \nStandards in Public Life, 2004; Philo & Berry, 2004; ITC, 2003). Furthermore \nbroadcast j ournalism retains a relatively high degree of public trust compared to other \nmedia and pubic institutions. A September 2004 survey found that that television \nnews is considered significantly more trustworthy than broadsheet j ournalism and \nseven times more so than the tabloid press. Partly this may be related to inherent \nveracity of the moving image embodied in the famous cliche that the 'camera never \nlies'. Tom Bums, the historian of the BBC notes that: \nbecause television news and current affairs programmes convey action, \nmovement, facial expression and demeanour, scenes and actors, as well as \nverbal messages, they seem more complete, more satisfactory than any \naccount provided by newspapers. 'Viewability' is easily construed as \nreliability because any intervention by broadcasters is largely invisible, and \nbecause the dramatic intensity of film and video recording carries conviction \nand guarantees authenticity in ways in which words cannot (Bums, 1977: 206, \ncited in Glasgow Media Group, 1993: 4) \nHowever television is also likely to be trusted because of its claims to impartiality, \nneutrality and objectivity. News is under a statutory obligation to be balanced and \nimpartial, and to refrain from editorialising in its broadcasts. As Schlesinger notes the \nnotion of being non-partisan and 'above the fray' in matters of public controversy has \nbeen the defining ethos of the BBC: \nI \nImpartiality is the linchpin of the BBC's ideology: it is a notion saturated with \npolitical and philosophical implications. What the BBC claims, when it says it \nis 'impartial', is that it has achieved institutional detachment from the conflicts \nof British society, and that the Corporation is independent of all interests. The \nnews is therefore held to represent all interests and points of view without an \nevaluative commitment to any (1978: 163). \nWhat appears on television news under the banner of impartiality has attracted \nacademic research (e. g. Glasgow Media Group, 1993,1985,1983,1982,1976; Miller, \n1994; Schlesinger, 1978; Murdock, 1973; Morley, 1976). Much of this research has \ntended to conclude that in practice, impartiality has usually meant reporting on the \nspectrum of views present at the Palace of Westminster. This is not to say that \noppositional or dissident voices are never heard, but that due to a variety of factors \nembedded in the news production process, they tend to be excluded. As Philo notes in \nthe struggle to be heard the 'structural position of the state and its information \nmanagers is one of potential dominance' but it is a dominance 'contested by \noppositional groups and through the interplay of the different organisational and \ncommercial priorities of the media' (Philo 1995: 222). \nThis thesis is an examination of how television news approaches its \nobligations to neutrality and impartiality when reporting on the one of the most \ncontroversial of all foreign news stories, the long running conflict between the Israelis \nand Palestinians. This research will examine whether broadcasters achieve balance or \nif some perspectives predominate. It will also evaluate the various factors and \nconstraints which impinge upon the reporting of the dispute, and relate them to the \ntheoretical debates in the area. In order to examine the range of views on the origins \nand history of the conflict, I present in chapter two a historiography of the conflict \nindicating the areas of consensus, and the points where historians diverge. In Chapter \nthree I present a content analysis of television news coverage of the peace talks \nbetween the Israelis and Palestinians which took place in America in October 1998. \nThe research looks at how much context and background is present and whether \ncertain perspectives and explanations predominate in reporting. In chapter four I look \nat the constraints and pressures that journalists face in reporting on the conflict. The \nfinal chapter pulls all the threads together and addresses some of the theoretical \n2 \ndebates around how the various political, economic, cultural and organisational \ncontexts affect the production of television news. \nHowever I want to start in this chapter by introducing the themes and debates \nwhich follow. This will involve a discussion of the uniquely controversial \nhistoriography of the conflict, together with a literature review of previous content \nanalyses in the area, and an assessment of the theoretical arguments about the various \nfactors effecting the production of news. \nThe Controversial Historiogrgphy of the Conflict \nIn chapter two I will examine various different perspectives on the history of \nthe conflict. This is to lay out the competing narratives which journalists can draw \nupon in explaining the conflict to viewers. Although there are areas of consensus \namongst historians there are also many areas over which there is still great \ndisagreement. As the Princeton historian L. Carl Brown has noted 'Israel's crowded \nhistory has been matched by a massive historiography. Israelis and foreigners, friends \nand foes, participants and observers, professionals and amateurs -- all have entered the \ndebate. '(Foreign Affairs, July/August 1998). Within this debate there has been much \nheat, as well as light, with accusations of academic dishonesty being unusually \ncommon. Indeed some have suggested that the historians are themselves directly \ninvolved as 'combatants' in the conflict. Writing in the New Statesman Stephen Howe \ncomments that: \nAll wars, in a sense, are history wars. Their protagonists are driven by rival \nvisions of the past, and people are willing to kill or die for those visions, at \nleast as much as they are for ideas about the future. The unending violence \nbetween Israelis and Palestinians is a particularly extreme case. There, \nhistorians themselves are combatants, whether they are working to sustain the \nnational myths that fuel the conflict, or trying to undermine them. (5 August \n2002) \nFor more than thirty years after the 1948 war there existed within Israeli \nsociety what could be described as an official or canonical Zionist history of the \n3 \nconflict. This narrative was accepted by the great bulk of the population and taught in \nall Israeli schools. According to the Israeli historian Avi Shlaim (2004) it fulfilled two \nobjectives. Firstly, 'it instilled a sense of nationhood in Jews from various countries of \norigin' and secondly, 'it enlisted international sympathy and support for the fledgling \nState of Israel' However he also notes that 'the one cause it emphatically did not serve \nis that of mutual understanding and reconciliation between Jews and Arabs. ' The \ntraditional narrative maintained that the Jewish attempt to create a homeland in their \nancestral lands in Palestine was a benign affair, which sought to develop the backward \nand sparsely populated country and bring the benefits of modernity to the Arab \npopulation. Under the British Mandate Jewish attempts to foster mutual understanding \nand cooperation were met with intransigence and outright hostility from the local \nArab population. Avi Shlaim sketches out the traditional narrative from the pivotal \nyear of 1948 onwards: \nThe conflict between Jews and Arabs in Palestine came to a head following \nthe passage, on 29 November 1947, of the United Nations partition resolution \nwhich called for the establishment of two states, one Jewish and one Arab. \nThe Jews accepted the UN plan despite the painful sacrifices it entailed but the \nPalestinians, the neighbouring Arab states, and the Arab League rejected it. \nGreat Britain did everything in its power towards the end of the Palestine \nMandate to frustrate the establishment of the Jewish state envisaged in the UN \nplan. With the expiry of the Mandate and the proclamation of the State of \nIsrael, five Arab states sent their armies into Palestine with the firm intention \nof strangling the Jewish state at birth. The subsequent struggle was an unequal \none between a Jewish David and an Arab Goliath. The infant Jewish state \nfought a desperate, heroic, and ultimately successful battle for survival against \noverwhelming odds. During the war, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians \nfled to the neighbouring Arab states, mainly in response to orders from their \nleaders and despite Jewish pleas to stay and demonstrate that peaceful co\u0002existence was possible. After the war, the story continues, Israeli leaders \nsought peace with all their heart and all their might but there was no one to \ntalk to on the other side. Arab intransigence alone was responsible for the \npolitical deadlock that was not broken until President Anwar Sadat's visit to \nJerusalem thirty years later. (2004) \n4 \nThe Palestinian narrative of the conflict could hardly be more different. It \nregarded Jewish immigration into Palestine as a form of European colonialism and \nquestioned the right of the British government to set up a Jewish homeland in an area \nwhere a settled population had been living for hundreds of years. They believed that \nthe Jewish immigrants came to take their land and dominate them, rather than develop \nthe country for the mutual benefit of both peoples. The 1948 war was as seen as \nnational catastrophe in which most Palestinians were ethnically cleansed in line with \nlong held plans to 'transfer' the indigenous population. After the war the Israeli state \ndespite pressure from the 'LN refused to allow the return of the refugees it had \nexpelled, strengthening the Palestinian view that the expulsions were premeditated. \nThe 1956 and 1967 wars were seen as attempts at territorial expansion by Israel, and \nthe 1982 invasion of Lebanon as well as the settlement program in the occupied \nterritories were seen as attempts to crush Palestinian nationalism and prevent the \nemergence of a Palestinian state. \nIt is clear that there is little common ground in the official Israeli and \nPalestinian narratives. However from the late 1970s onwards the traditional Israeli \nnarrative began to come under increasing pressure from dissident academics within \nIsrael. Initially it was sociologists rather than historians who began to question the \ndominant perspective. Sociologists such as Shlomo Swirski and Deborah Bernstein \nquestioned the dominant functionalist paradigm in Israeli sociology which stressed the \nintegration and adaptation of Israel's diverse social groups. These sociologists saw \nIsraeli society riven by inequality and schisms between Ashkenazi (of European \norigin) and Mizrahim (of Middle eastern origin) Jews, between secular and orthodox \nJews, between the Arab and Jewish citizens of the state and between the Israeli \noccupying forces and the Palestinians living under military rule. The Israeli \nsociologist Lawrence Silberstein suggests that the controversial 1982 Israeli invasion \nof Lebanon placed further strain on the traditional Israeli version of history: \nIsrael's invasion of Lebanon in 1982, and the ensuing sense of shock, \ndisillusionment and demoralization led to the emergence of peace groups \npreviously unknown in Israel. In the wake of that war, many Israelis came to \nfeel a previously unknown scepticism concerning Israel's officially stated \ncommitment to fighting only defensive and to pursuing peace on all fronts. \nThe trauma of Lebanon became the equivalent of the trauma of Vietnam in the \n5 \nUnited States in the nineteen sixties and seventies. In the meantime the effects \nof the long years of occupying territories conquered in the 1967 War and \ncontrolling a hostile and restless population rendered problematic the \ndominant representations of Zionism as a humane, progressive movement. \n(Silberstein, 1999: 72) \nIn the aftermath of the Lebanon invasion the prime minister Menachem Begin \ngave a lecture to the IDF staff academy on wars of choice and wars of no choice in \nwhich he argued that the Lebanon war like the 1956 Suez War was a war of choice \nundertaken for political objectives. Shlaim suggests that with 'this admission, \nunprecedented in the history of the Zionist movement, the national consensus round \nthe notion of ein breira [no choice] began to crumble, creating political space for a \ncritical re-examination of the country's earlier history' (2004). The following year an \nIsraeli sociologist Baruch Kimmerling published a study entitled Zionism and \nTerritory: The Socio- Territorial Dimension of Zionist Politics which challenged the \nnotion that pre- 1948 Jewish settlement was undertaken to benefit both the both Jewish \nand Arab populations. Kimmerling, for the first time in the Israeli academy, utilized a \nEuropean colonial model to analyse Jewish settlement policies, thus substantially \nnarrowing the gap with the Palestinian perspective of this period. The following year \nTom Segev, a journalist and historian published 1949: The First Israelis which \nchallenged other aspects of the official history. These included the claims that the \nPalestinian refugees of 1948 had left their homes willingly, that Israel did everything \nit could to bring about peace after 1948, and that the Middle Eastern Jews who arrived \nin Israel after 1948 were integrated into the collective without economic and social \ndiscrimination. Silberstein suggest that Segev's book was a direct challenge to many \naspects of how Israeli saw themselves and their relationship to the state: \nTypifying the new scholarship emerging in the 1980s and 1990s, Segev argued \nthat his book 'shattered a firmly established self-image and exposed as mere \nmyths a large number of long established truisms. ' These 'myths' grounded in \nZionist discourse and produced and disseminated by the state apparatus, \nprovided Israelis with the basic materials out of which they constructed their \nself understanding as a collective. Additionally they provided the state with its \nbasic legitimation. Constituting the 'common sense' of Israeli culture, they \n6 \nshaped the way in which most Israelis viewed social, cultural and political \nreality. (1999: 77). \nHowever it wasn't until 1988 that the issues raised by the 'new historians' \nbroke into the mainstream. In that year four works were released with challenged \nfundamental aspects of the traditional history: Avi Shlaim's Collusion across the \nJordan: King Abdullah, the Zionist Movement, and the Partition ofPalestine; Simha \nFlapan's The Birth of1srael: Myths and Realities; Benny Morris's The Birth of the \nPalestinian Refugee Problem, 1947-1949; and Ilan Pappe's Britain and the Arab\u0002Israeli Conflict, 1947-5. All of these works took issue with the traditional Israeli \nnarrative of 1948 and the notion that Israel had earnestly sought peace after the war. \nBenny Morris's book in particular provoked a furious backlash amongst some Israelis. \nThe most ferocious criticism came from Shabtai Teveth, a journalist and biographer \nof David Ben-Gurion, who penned an article entitled 'Charging Israel with Original \nSin' which appeared in the conservative American-Jewish monthly Commentary \n(September 1989). In the article Teveth accused Morris of producing a 'farrago of \ndistortions, omissions, tendentious readings, and outright falsifications', whose \npolitical purpose was to generate sympathy for the Palestinians and de-legitimate the \nIsraeli state (cited in Shlaim, 2004). As Silberstein notes the debate demonstrated that \n'far more than scholarly methods and historical accuracy were at stake. Extending far \nbeyond the walls of the academy, the questions raised by the young scholars had the \neffect of problematizing prevailing notions of Israeli collective identity as well as the \ntrustworthiness of the authorities of the state' (1999: 84). Throughout the 1990s the \nnew historians continued to question further aspects of the traditional Israeli history \nand in particular whether it was the Arab or Israeli intransigence which was to blame \nfor the failure to conclude peace treaties. Shlaim suggests that this issue is: \nparticularly sensitive because it entails the allocating of responsibility for the \npersistence of the conflict. At the core of the old version is the image of the \nArab world as a monolithic and implacably hostile enemy. According to this \nversion, Israel's leaders strove indefatigably towards a peaceful settlement of \nthe dispute but all their efforts foundered on the rocks of Arab intransigence. \nThe revisionist version holds that Israel was more inflexible than the Arab \nstates and that she consequently bears a larger share of the responsibility for \n7 \nthe diplomatic stalemate that remained in place long after the ending of \nmilitary hostilities. (2004) \nIn 1999 the debate was re-ignited by the publication of two highly influential works, \nAvi Shlaim's The Iron Wall: Israel and the Arab World and Benny Morris's \nRighteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1999. Both drew \nplaudits from European and some Israelis critics but were also subject to significant \ncriticism. In a Ha'aretz article Israeli novelist Ahron Meged accused Shlaim and \nMorris of leading the country towards collective suicide, whilst in a ten page review \nof the books in The New Republic Anita Shapira accused the authors of being \n'heretical elements' who 'doubted the right of Israel to exist and stressed the wrongs \nthat were perpetrated against the Arabs' (29 November 1999). Shlaim claimed that \nShapira's review was inspired by the fear that the 'old historians' were 'losing the \nbattle for the hearts and minds of their compatriots' and that the article was 'redolent \nof defeat on the intellectual battlefield'. The outbreak of the second intifada in late \n2000 and the election of the hardline Sharon administration led to a move away from \nthe 'new history' and a return to the traditional narrative. Six months before his \nelection Ariel Sharon was asked what changes he would like to see to the Israeli \neducation sysem and he replied that he 'would like them to study the history of the \npeople of Israel and the land of Israel \n... \nthe children must be taught Jewish-Zionist \nvalues, and the 'new historians' must not be taught. ' (cited in Shlaim, 2004). When \nthe Sharon administration came to power, the new education minister Limor Livnat \nordered the re-writing of all the history books for secondary school and the removal of \nall traces of the 'new history'. \nDuring the 1980s and 1990s the new historians had considerably narrowed the \ngap between the Israel and Palestinian versions of the conflict. Pappe suugest that \nthere is now enough common ground between the two versions to create what he \ndescribes as a 'bridging narrative' on the events of 1948. This he suggests is \nimportant in creating the conditions for a sucessftil resolution to the conflict since it \nentails the recognition by Israel of 'the centrality of the refugee problem in the \nPalestinian historical narrative, collective memory and national ethos' (1999: 59). \nSimilarly another of the 'new historians' Avi Shlairn also sees a narrowing of the gap \nbetween the narratives as a necessary pre-condition for a resolution of the conflict: \n8 \nIn all these different ways, the new history helped to create a climate, on both \nsides of the Israeli-Arab divide, which was conducive to the continuation of \nthe peace process. As Bishop Tutu pointed out in the South African context, it \nis difficult to know what to forgive unless we know what happened. In the \nMiddle East, as in South Africa, it is necessary to understand the past in order \nto go forward \n... \nXenophobic and self-righteous national narratives only fuel \nand prolong this tragic conflict. A more complex and fair-minded \nunderstanding of the past is therefore essential for preserving at least the \nprospect of reconciliation in the future (2004). \nBoth the Israeli and Palestinian positions, and justifications for their actions \nare intimately linked to their particular version of the past. Into this controversy \njournalists must select certain salient information to contextualise stories and explain \nevents. I now want to review research which has looked at how j ournalists have tried \nto accomplish this. \nPrevious Research on Media Coverage of the Israel-Palestine Conflict \nAmerican Research \nOne approach adopted by researchers has been to examine how reporting on the \nconflict has changed over time. Zaharna examined the portrayal of Palestinians in \nTime magazine between 1947 and 1993. He suggests that because of the close \nrelationship between Israel and the United States news from Israel has been treated \nlike a domestic story, and that rather than balancing Israeli and Palestinian sources \nTime has tended to quote 'extensively from American politicians and Israelis' and that \n'because American politicians tended to be supportive of Israeli views this practice \n[has] served to reinforce the Israeli perspective and negate the Palestinian message' \n(1995: 3 8-39). In the period around the creation of the Israeli state Zaharna claims \nthat Jewish leaders were cited much more frequently than Arab leaders and that Time \nfeatured many personalised stories of Jews in Palestine. Personalised stories on \nPalestinians did not begin to appear in the magazine until the first intifada in 1988. In \nthe period from 1950 until the Six Day War Zaharna found that descriptions of Arab \n9 \nleaders corresponded closely with American foreign policy. Wl-iilst the US ally King \nHussein of Jordan was presented positively, Nasser was portrayed as a 'prominent \nArab villain' 0 995: 4 1). From this period until the outbreak of the first intifada \nPalestinians had a dual image of terrorist and refugee. Palestinians were portrayed as \n'dedicated, vicious political fanatics' (Time, 21 September 1970) or 'unpredictable \nterrorists' (Time, 19 March 1973) and their behaviour described as 'insensible terror' \n(Time, 27 May 1974) or 'savage and irrational' (Time, 7 January 1974). Zaharna \nsuggests that President Carter's call for a Palestinian homeland in 1977 and the Camp \nDavid agreements, which called for expanded Palestinian autonomy, increased the \nlegitimacy of their cause whilst the Sabra and Shatilla killings maintained their image \nas victims. During the first intifada the author found that Time produced more positive \nimages of Palestinians, sometimes highlighting their claims to independence and self\u0002determination. He suggests that this may have been partly due to attacks on foreign \njournalists by members of the IDF. In the period leading up to the Oslo accords \nZahama found that positive images of Yasser Arafat became much more frequent. He \nsuggests that Arafat's deal making with Israel led to him being recognised as a \nlegitimate leader of the Palestinians nineteen years after he was officially recognised \nby the United Nations and that 'the irony was that the gap between the Palestinian \nleadership and people's media image was ultimate bridged through the PLO's ability \nnot to align itself with its own people in 1974 but with Israel in 1993' (1995: 47). \nNoakes and Wilkins (2002) examined a random sample of Associated Press \nand New York Times articles for the period 1984-1998 and assessed three variables: \nhow much attention the conflict received; which sources were cited; and how \nPalestinian actions were framed. Noakes and Wilkins found that both the first intifada \nand the beginning of the Oslo peace process in 1993 led to a large increase in news \ncoverage. They argue that the first intifada 'as a grassroots protest against an \noppressive government \n... \nframe[d] the Palestinian cause in terms similar to those \nadvanced by many movements in the US including the Civil Rights Movement' and \nthat 'such frames resonate [d] with the producers of TV news and the American \npublic' (2002: 659). However the authors offer no evidence in form of interviews or \nfocus group studies with viewers or broadcasters to support these claims. Other \nresearch in this area, suggests that it can be dangerous to make assumptions about \nhow the activities of Palestinians opposing the occupation will be read by audiences, \nas a crucial factor is whether viewers see the struggle as legitimate (Philo & Berry, \n10 \n2004). Noakes and Wilkins did find that a consistent pattern in sourcing that official \nIsrael spokespersons were consistently cited more than official Palestinian sources by \na factor of two to one, although the use of official Palestinian sources increased \nmarkedly after the signing of the Oslo agreements. They also found that the framing \nof Palestinian resistance changed over time. Prior to the first intifada Palestinians \nwere three times more likely to be portrayed as 'terrorists' rather than the 'victims' in \nthe struggle, whilst during the uprising they were presented as terrorists only slightly \nmore than victims. The authors claim that: \nIt was also during the intifada period that the Palestinian struggle was most \nlikely to be presented as just. Fewer than one out of ten news articles framed \nthe Palestinian struggle as justified prior to the intifada, but more than one \nquarter (27.5 percent) of the articles did so during the intifada. The appearance \nof this frame in US news media, however declines quickly in subsequent \nperiods. In contrast, Palestinians were most likely to be seen to have a right to \nself-determination or national sovereignty after the Oslo Accords (2002: 664) \nAlthough the researchers do not draw the conclusion, one possible explanation \nfor the media choosing to portray the Palestinian demand for national self\u0002determination more favourably after the Oslo Accords was that they were taking their \ncue from official American foreign policy. The signing of the accords on the White \nHouse lawn in 1993 may have indicted to news editors and j ourrialists that the \nPalestinian claim to self-determination was now a legitimate perspective. \nOther research has focused on how the media reported on specific events, such \nas the first Palestinian intifada. For instance, Daniel (1995) argues that images from \nthe first intifada presented a challenge to the dominant representation of the conflict. \nShe maintains that most news fits into standard storylines in which the 'prevailing \nconventional wisdom is not challenged and the status quo interpretation of the world \nis preserved' (1995: 64). However the 1987 uprising 'presented a serious challenge to \nthe predominant conception of Israel as a tiny democracy surrounded by hostile forces \nand constantly threatened by Palestinian terrorists' (1995: 62). She suggests that the \nimages of women and children facing faces tanks and an-ned with stones didn't fit \nwith previous images of 'turban shrouded, almost exclusively male militants' (1995: \n67). Thus footage from the conflict 'recontextualised the Palestinian population as one \ncomposed not just of a few terrorist males but of families and community, a major \nbase for identification' (1995: 68). Daniel suggests that the introduction of such \ncomplexities 'and grey areas into a situation that was previously a clear contest of \ngood and evil, of victim and villain' served to open up discussion on issues such the \noccupation, and Palestinian demands for self-determination (1995: 67). She also cites \nAmerican public opinion data to argue that public opinion of Palestinians became \nmore positive during the intifada. \nWolfsfeld in an another study of American media coverage of the first intifada \nargues that the uprising provided 'an almost textbook case of how a seemingly weaker \nchallenger can shatter the authorities' domination over the political environment and \nsuccessfully promote their frames to the news media' (1997: 127). Wolfsfeld argues \nthat two frames vied for competition in the intifada, the 'law and order frame' which \ndefined the uprising as composed of criminal acts and social disorder, and the \n'injustice and defiance frame' which presented the uprising as a response to a 'brutal \nmilitary occupation'. Echoing the claims made by Daniel above, Wolfsfeld argued \nthat the 'injustice and defiance frame' was more successful because the \n'confrontations in the streets and allies of the West Bank and Gaza provided more \nthan just journalistic resonance, they also had a good fit with Palestinian claims \nconcerning Israeli brutality' (1997: 153). Also in line with the position taken by \nNoakes and Wilkins, Wolfsfeld argues that the 'information and images collected by \nAmerican journalists resonated both professionally and politically with an injustice \nand defiance frame' a perspective which 'dominates the political culture of American \ntelevision news' (1997: 160). The author argues that the 'Palestinians were the clear \nwinners in the cultural contest over the intifada' because they were successful in \nemphasising that the occupation was to blame. However in the absence of any \naudience research it is speculative to impose a priori categories of understanding on \nviewers, by assuming that they will employ an 'injustice and defiance frame' when \ninterpreting the uprising. Also the same criticism applies to his assumption that the \ninequities of the occupation were the dominant theme in coverage. As a former \nmember of the IDF the consequences of the intifada may be clear to the writer, but \nsome audience research suggests that ordinary viewers are unlikely to understand its \nsocial ramifications unless they are properly explained (Philo & Berry, 2004). \nGilboa (1993) argues that the media coverage of the intifada was 'biased' \nagainst Israel, but despite this 'American chiefly blamed the PLO for the violence and \n12 \nwere divided on other important issues: whether the riots were acts of violence or acts \nof disobedience, whether the reason for the violence were legitimate or not' (1993: \n98). Gilboa points to public opinion research which found that 63 percent of \nAmericans thought the PLO a 'terrorist organisation' and only fourteen percent who \nsaw it as a 'national liberation movement', and claimed that 'despite the forceful \ndemands of the Palestinians to establish an independent Palestinian state5 the US \npublic did not support this solution' (1993 : 102) However some may question the \nimpartiality of Gilboa's methods. Much of the research he cites which purports to \nshow an anti-Israel bias was produced by pro-Israel lobby groups like the Anti\u0002Defamation League, whilst some of the opinion polling questions he cites are leading. \nFor instance one question asked: \nWhich of the two opinions is closer to yours: The US shouldn't negotiate with \nthe PLO because they are terrorists and they refuse to recognise the right of \nIsrael to exist; or in order to bring about peace in the Middle East we should \nbe willing to talk to all parties involved? (1993: 104) \nMore recent research on the al Aqsa intifada has argued that there is an \nimbalance in media coverage which favours, Israel. For instance Lowstedt and \nMadhoun (2002) cite research which looked at a six month sample of American \nPublic Radio (NPR) broadcasts which found that 81 per cent of Israeli deaths in the \nconflict were reported as opposed to only 34 percent of Palestinian deaths. The \nimbalance was even more marked in relation to the deaths of children, with 89 percent \nof Israeli child deaths reported compared to 20 percent of Palestinian child deaths. \nThe researchers also found that whilst NPR was more likely to report the deaths of \nIsraeli civilians than Israeli security personnel (84 percent to 69 percent) the opposite \nwas true with regard to Palestinians where the deaths of Palestinian fighters was more \nlikely to be reported than the deaths of Palestinian civilians (72 percent to 20 percent). \nThey suggest that because of this imbalance 'consumers of US public media are likely \nto believe that nearly 50 percent of the people killed were Jews, and most of the \nchildren killed were Jews too' (2002: 48). Although the authors offer no audience \nresearch to back up these claims, audience research on British perceptions on the \nconflict did suggest that viewers tended to assume that Jewish casualties were at least \nas high as Palestinian ones and that this mirrored their relative prominence in news \n13 \nbroadcasts (Philo & Berry, 2004). Lowestedt & Madhoun also point to a six months \nstudy of NBC, CBS and ABC reports on al Aqsa intifada which found that Israelis \nwere reported as 'responding' or 'retaliating' to Palestinian far more often than \nPalestinians were described as 'retaliating' (79 percent to 9 percent). They suggest \nthat the 'impression was thus fostered that Israel acts violently in self defence, in \nresponse to violence initiated by their foes almost nine times more than Palestinians' \n(2002: 48). They also point to coverage which often presents attacks on Israelis as \nbreaking a period of 'calm' despite the fact that the 'calm' had included the killing of \nmany Palestinians: \nWhen Israelis are killed by Palestinians the acts are often referred to by the US \nmedia as the end of a 'calm' period, as a 'flare-up in violence'. For example, \non September 18 and 19,2002, six Israelis were killed in the two Palestinian \nsuicide bomb attacks in six weeks. All major US news outlets referred to the \npreceding six weeks as 'calm'. However during that time, 54 Palestinians were \nkilled by the Israelis, most of them unarmed civilians, totally uninvolved in \nresistance activities (2002: 48) \nAckerman (2002) also argues that there is an imbalance in American media \ncoverage, in that the Palestinian perspective that they are resisting a violent military \noccupation is presented infrequently. He argues that even the use of the words \n'occupied' and 'occupied territories' has become rarer in recent years: \nThe word 'occupation' has become almost taboo for American reporters. Even \nthe designation 'occupied territories' once routine has all but disappeared. In \nthe early 1990s 'occupied territories' showed up in hundreds of AP articles \nevery year- 699 in 1992 and 731 in 1993. Nearly a third of all articles \nmentioning Palestinians used the term. By the end of the decade the number of \nappearances had dwindled to a few dozen. During the first eleven months of \n2000, barely one I percent of articles mentioned the dreaded phrase. On the \nthree major networks' evening news broadcasts- 'ABC World News Tonight', \n'NBC Nightly News, ' and 'CBS Evening News'- the West Bank or Gaza were \nninety nine news stories since the fighting began in late September. Of those \n14 \nninety nine stories, only four used the word 'occupied, ' 6 occupation' or any \nother variation. (2002: 62). \nAckerman argues that the upshot of this is that 'instead of honest account of \neach sides' grievances, journalists reporting on the clashes in the West Bank and Gaza \noffer what is, in effect, a daily catalogue of seemingly unprovoked Palestinian \naggression' (2002: 62). For instance, Ackerman points to a bulletin on NBC's 'World \nNews Tonight' (9 October 2000) presented by Jim Wooten which reported on \nskirmishes between the IDF and Palestinians in Nablus, in which Palestinians were \npresented as 'looking for confrontation' with Israel, wielding 'rocks and bottles', \ninitiating a 'gun battle' yet 'one more example' of how their 'anger is turning more \nviolent and more deadly' (2002: 62). However Ackerman argues that the Palestinian \ngrievances are not difficult to locate or present, and that j ournalists also avoid \nreporting the perspective of the UN which has frequently criticised the occupation: \nBut what are the Palestinians' grievances? Why did they choose to confront \nIsrael's soldiers? Like most of his colleagues, Wooten maintains a studious \nsilence, not mentioning the Israeli army posts surrounding Nablus or the \ncheckpoints controlling the entrances to the town- even before the current \nround of violence began. Nor does he mention the bypass roads for settlers \nonly or the ongoing expropriations of Palestinian land for expansion of the \nfour nearby settlements, which are populated by armed militants many of \nwhom support extremist religious leaders like the late Rabbi Meir Kahane, \nwho advocated the expulsion of Arabs from the West Bank. And finally, he \nmakes no reference to the fact that the entire apparatus of military occupation \nis illegal under the Geneva Conventions or that the UN Security Council \nresolutions have repeatedly demanded Israel's withdrawal. (2002: 63) \nAckerman also points to other instances where US newspapers have chosen \nnot to report criticism of Israel by bodies such as the United Nations and Amnesty \nInternational. For instance when at the beginning of the intifada the UN security \ncouncil passed a resolution condemning Israel's 'excessive use of force against \nPalestinians' Ackerman claims that only three of the top thirty six US newspapers in \nthe Nexis database devoted an article to the vote with none of the headlines \n15 \nmentioning Israel by name. Shortly afterwards Amnesty International released a \nstatement condemning Israel's 'pattern of gross human rights violations that may \namount to war crimes'. Ackerman notes that this statement was briefly noted by the \nBoston Globe and Washington Post but ignored by most of the other major \nnewspapers including the New York Times. Ackerman also suggests that the US media \nare far more likely to accept the Israeli version of events when Palestinian civilians \nare killed in controversial circumstances and points to US media coverage of the \nkilling of Mohammed al-Dura. Whilst the Palestinians regarded the killing as \nperpetuated deliberately by the IDF, Israeli spokesmen argued that the boy had been \n'killed in the crossfire'. Ackerman found that the phrase 'killed in the crossfire': \nappeared in the US media with remarkable uniformity: 'NBC Nightly News' \nand 'CBS Evening News' (both 30 September 2000), along with the Baltimore \nSun, Boston Globe, Los Angeles Times, and Washington Post (all I October \n2000) all used some variation of 'caught in the crossfire' to describe the boy's \nshooting, even though Israeli responsibility was fairly clear. Israel later \nacknowledged its soldiers had shot the boy with one of its spokesmen \nadmitting that the initial denial had damaged the government's credibility. \n(2002: 66) \nNoam Chomsky (e. g. 2000,1999,1996,1993,1992,1991,1988) has written \nextensively on US media coverage of the conflict and accused the press of \nsystematically misrepresenting fundamental aspects of the dispute. Chomsky's \nmethod has been to compare what appears in the American press, with a particular \nemphasis on major publications such as the New York Times, Washington Post, Time \nand Newsweek with reports from the Israeli, European and Arab media, the United \nNations, human rights groups, as well as what has been published in official \ngovernment documentation and historical texts. Chomsky then uses these alternative \nsources of information as a method for evaluating the veracity and accuracy of what is \nreported in the American press. Chomsky argues that the American press has \nconsistently viewed the conflict from an Israeli perspective, and presents evidence to \nshow that Israeli human rights abuses such as extra-judicial killings, torture, collective \npunishments and theft of land and water are largely ignored by the media, whilst \nPalestinian attacks on Israelis are highlighted and condemned. He argues that the long \n16 \nhistory of Israel defying U`N resolutions is ignored, whilst American diplomatic and \nfinancial support for policies which breach international law and the Geneva \nConventions is rarely mentioned in the media. One of the most serious charges he \nmakes is that j oumalists have consistently misrepresented the Palestinian and wider \nArab position towards Israel, presenting it as intransigent and unwilling to come to \nany accommodation with Israel, whilst presenting the Israelis as the more \naccommodating partner. Chomsky presents evidence including UN resolutions, peace \nplans as well as official Arab and Israeli statements which suggest the obverse, that it \nwas the Palestinians and Arab states who have strived for a negotiated settlement \nsince the 1970s, and that this has been consistently rejected by Israel and the United \nStates. Such evidence he suggests has been dispatched to 'Orwell's useful memory \nhole' (1999: 71): \nAmerican commentators are still more extreme in their rejection of the \nhistorical record, as in the sample of cases cited. In the early years the PLO \nwas no less re . ectionist than Israel, and its call for a 'democratic secular state' \nwas not what it appeared on the surface. But it simply cannot be denied that \nfrom the mid 1970s, the PLO has moved increasingly towards an \naccommodationist position. Whilst concealing this record, propagandists \nsearch desperately for statements by PLO spokesmen that reveal their \nunremitting hostility to Israel and unwillingness to accept it. Israeli doves have \nregarded such efforts with contempt, pointing out that the same logic would \nlead to the conclusions that no one should have any dealings with the Zionist \nmovement or the State of Israel, since its leaders have consistently rejected \nany Palestinian rights and have repeatedly indicated that they regard as any \npolitical settlement as a temporary stage leading to further expansion. What is \nmore they have acted on these principles. We return to the record which is not \nwithout interest and is generally concealed here. That outright propagandists \nshould resort to these practices is not very surprising; that, after all, is their \nvocation. It is interesting that the practice is common across a broad spectrum \nof western opinion, particularly in the US as one aspect of the ideological \nsupport for Israel. (1999: 76-77) \n17 \nIn an analysis of the 'Oslo 11' peace agreement struck in 1995 and the \nassassination of Yitzak Rabin soon after, Chomsky claims that American and British \njournalists misrepresented what had been agreed. In particular he points to claims that \nIsrael had agreed to relinquish the West Bank and Gaza, despite the fact that that \nIsraeli leaders had made clear public statements that they would not allow the \nPalestinians full statehood,, and what autonomy they would be granted would be \nconfined to less than half of the West Bank: \nThe signing of Oslo 11 and the Rabin assassination shortly afterwards received \nenormous attention and coverage. Typical headlines after the signing give the \nflavour. 'Israel agrees to quit the West Bank. ' 'Israel Ends Jews' Biblical \nClaim on the West Bank. ' In 'Rabin's historic trade with Arabs, ' a 'historical \ncompromise. ' 'Israelis, Palestinians find a painful peace, ' establishing an \n'undeniable reality: The Palestinians are on their way to an independent state; \nthe Jews are bidding farewell to portions of the Holy Land to which they have \nhistorically felt most linked. ' 'Score one for Clinton. ' 'At White House, \nsymbols of a day of awe'... The New York Times lead story after the \nassassination reported that Rabin had 'conquered the ancient lands on the \nWest Bank of the Jordan' and then 'negotiated the accord to eventually cede \nIsraeli control of them to the Palestinians'... The former Jerusalem bureau \nchief of the Washington Post reported that 'when Rabin Israelis the possibility \nof 'separation' of walling off the Gaza Strip and West Bank and getting the \nPalestinians out of sight and mind- the majority responded with enthusiasm'. \n'Those who murdered Rabin, and those who incited them, didn't do so \nbecause they opposed to create a Palestinian Bantustan' the New Statesman \ncorrespondent reported from Jerusalem, chiding Edward Said for thinking \notherwise. 'No: they knew that the course Rabin was charting would lead, \nunless stopped, to a Palestinian state'... One intriguing feature is that the \nfactual assertions are not even close to true. Israel did not 'agree to quit the \nWest Bank' or 'Ends Jews' Biblical Claim on the West Bank. ' It signed no \n4agreement extending Palestinian rule to most of the West Bank' or 4to \neventually cede Israeli control of West bank lands to the Palestinians. ' Rabin \nnever so much as hinted at an offer of 'walling off the Gaza Strip and West \n18 \nBank'; quite the contrary, he was adamant, clear and consistent that in \nstressing that nothing of the sort was even a remote possibility. (1999: 553-4) \nChomsky claims that there are at least three clearly identifiable reasons why \nthe American media is more sympathetic to the Israeli position.. Partly, he claims, it is \nbecause of the influence of the pro-Israel lobby, but he suggests that this extends \nbeyond the American Jewish community to incorporate 'major segments of liberal \nopinion, the leadership of the labour unions, religious fundamentalists' as well as \n'conservatives' who support high military spending and 'adventurism abroad' (1999: \n13). Secondly, Chomsky claims that Israel serves as a strategic ally of the United \nStates in an area of the world which holds the bulk of the planet's energy reserves' \nThirdly he notes that Israel had proved useful as a conduit for military aid and training \nto repressive regimes who could not be directly supported because of adverse \npublicity or congressional bans imposed because of major human rights abuses. 2 \nBritish Research \nIn Britain very little academic research on media coverage of the conflict has been \nuntaken, reflecting the general paucity of empirical media research in universities \n(Philo & Miller, 200 1). However Christopher Mayhew, an MP and the journalist \nMichael Adams produced a book in 1975 accusing the press and broadcast media of \nfavouring the Israeli over the Palestinian perspective. The authors accused the press of \nfailing to report Israeli contraventions of international law in the occupied territories \nsuch as land expropriations, the bulldozing of houses, and the use of torture and \ncollective punishments. They also argued that the press provided little historical \ncontext and didn't feature the Arab point of view: \nEditors were curiously reluctant to criticise Israeli policies and actions, even \nwhen those conflicted with United Nations resolutions, as over Jerusalem, for \ninstance, where Israel's annexation of the Arab sector of the city and the \nsubsequent expropriation of hundreds of acres of Palestinian land were carried \nout in defiance of specific rulings by both the Security Council and the \nGeneral Assembly \n... \nOn the other hand, these same editors fastened with relief \non the mistakes of the Arabs, and were especially severe in their denunciations \n19 \nof terrorism on the part of a desperate minority of Palestinians, who now \nbegan to resort to force in an effort to break the hold of the Israelis on the \noccupied territories \n... \nIn short, it was very rare, in those years after 1967, to \nfind in the British press any coherent statement of the Arab point of view over \nthe Palestine question or any explanation of the origins of the Arab-Israeli \nconflict. (Mayhew & Adams, 1975: 80-8 1) \nThe authors maintained that this was partly as a consequence of the existence \nof a number of 'highly articulate supporters of Israel' employed as correspondents and \neditors. They pointed to reporters such as David Spanier of The Times, John Kimiche \nof the Evening Standard, Eric Silver and Terence Prittie at the Guardian, as well as \neditors of the New Statesman and The Economist. Mayhew and Adams argue that this \ninfluence was reinforced by broader public relations involving a 'wide variety of \nindividuals and organisations' (1975: 7 1): \n[The Israeli case] was made openly and the whole ineffectively, through such \norganisations as the Zionist Federation and the Jewish National Fund, with \ntheir research bureaux and their press officers. It was made more discreetly \nthrough the influential Board of Deputies of British Jews and the powerful \nZionist members of the Jewish community in Britain, men like Lord Janner, \nLord Shinwell, Sir Marcus Sieff, as well of many Jewish MPs, who can claim \nthe ear of the Editor of The Times or the Director-General of the BBC where \nlesser mortals would be turned away. It was made more crudely through \nJewish advertisers. And it was perhaps most effectively made, in the long run, \nby the many Zionist sympathisers, both Jewish and gentile, who were actually \nemployed in the press or who, as freelance commentators, enjoyed a wider \nreadier access to the columns of our leading newspapers than did comparable \nwriters whose views were critical of Israel. Among these last, we must note \nthe truly extraordinary phenomenon of the Jewish correspondents employed in \nIsrael by almost every newspaper and the BBC \n... \nnor should one forget the \nIsraeli Embassy in London, whose staff were diligent, as they had every right \nto be, in cultivating the press and in inviting them for highly organised tours of \nIsrael. (1975: 71-72) \n20 \nThe authors spoke of the problems they had getting articles which were critical \nof Israeli actions published in the Guardian, Times or Observer and the controversy \nthat ensued when articles were published. For instance Adams recalls the pressure that \nwas brought to bear on the editor of the Guardian after the journalist had reported on \nIsraeli violations of the Geneva Conventions in the Gaza Strip: \nThe editor of the Guardian, who published the despatches I sent, found \nhimself the target for much criticism and even abuse as a result. A campaign \nwas orchestrated in which the British Embassy, the Jewish press in Britain and \na number of individuals tried to discredit me, and through me the paper. The \nJewish Observer published an 'Open Letter to the Guardian' criticising the \neditor's irresponsibility and suggesting that somehow he was in league with \nwhat the writer called 'your Arab friends'... A paper called Israel \nToday \n... \nopenly accused me of publishing anti-Semitic material. The Israeli \npress attache wrote a very long letter denying the precise accusations that I \nhad made about breaches of the Geneva Conventions by the Israelis in \nGaza \n... \nThese were the outward and visible signs of the pressure being exerted \nto silence me, and while they were not difficult to answer, I could not be \nsurprised if the editor was disturbed by them and the personal interventions \nwhich were being made to him. (1975: 78) \nOn television and radio the authors suggested that the situation was little \ndifferent because a 'natural pro-Israel bias was built into our broadcasting simply \nbecause our society includes a talented and influential Jewish minority. '(1 975: 95). \nThe authors pointed to a study showing that during the 1973 October War, Israeli \nsources interviewed on the radio programme World at One outnumbered Arab sources \nby a factor of four to one. There were also claims that organised lobby groups were \nable to exert pressure on television broadcasters if material was considered critical of \nIsrael. Brian Magee, the former Labour MP for Waltham Forest argued that television \npresented reality through an Israeli prism: \nUnfortunately we in this country tended to look at the conflict very much from \none side, the Israeli side, until quite recently. And when we were infected by \nthe one-sidedness, the fanaticism almost. For instance, our television and \n21 \nnewspapers reported the Six Day War of 1967 almost entirely from the Israeli \npoint of view, without much audible protest from anyone, so far as I can \nremember. Yet when it was all over I presented a programme on ITV which \nraised the questions, how did the Arabs feel now, what are their reactions to \ndefeat, how do they see their immediate future, and before the program had \neven finished the switchboard at Television House was jammed with \ntelephone calls protesting about British television being given over to the Arab \npoint of view. There were shoals of letters afterwards, the Directors of the \nCompany received personal complaints, there was a reference to the program \nin the House of Commons. (The Listener, 19 March 1970, cited in Mayhew \nand Adams, 1975: 104) \nSuch pressure appeared to effect the approach taken by the BBC towards \nimpartiality. When questioned by a member of the Council for Arab British \nUnderstanding about perceived pro-Israel bias in programming, the BBC Secretariat \nappeared to argue, in a quite remarkable letter, that the Corporation should not seek to \nprovide equal coverage of the Israeli and Palestinian viewpoints, but instead should \nreflect in its coverage the greater power of the pro-Israel lobby: \nOne must acknowledge that j ournalists doing an honest job in this country \nhave to take an account of the Israeli or Zionist public relations activities are \nconducted with a degree of sophistication which those on the other side have \nrarely matched, and that supporters of Israel in this country represent a much \nmore vocal and powerful minority that supporters of the Arab cause. In other \nwords, an accurate reflection of publicly expressed attitudes on the issue will \ninevitably reveal at times a preponderance of sympathy for the Israeli side. If it \nexists it will be reflected no matter however hard one tries to be neutral and \nfair. Indeed we would be open to justified censure if we, so to speak cooked \nthe books and pretended that situation was different. (Jim Norris, BBC \nSecretariat to Mr Michael Adams, 23 January 1974, cited in Mayhew and \nAdams, 1975: 98). \nI want to finish this literature review by noting studies which have examined how \nArabs and Palestinians have been represented in popular culture. Although these \n22 \ndepictions are fictional, there is a danger that they can reinforce representations \npresent in news and current affairs programming. \nRepresentations in Popular Culture \nA number of studies have examined how Palestinians and Arabs more \ngenerally have been depicted within popular culture (Shaheen, 2003; Al-Quazzaz, \n1983; Said, 1981; Suleiman, 1983; Campbell 1995, Fuller 1995). For instance \nCampbell examined depictions of Iranians in US motion pictures and argued that \n'theoretically these films represent sheer entertainment, but because the images \nduplicate those presented on television and in newspapers they underscore 'factual \nportrayal\" (1995: 185). Campbell concluded that the movie depictions of Iranians \nfostered 'stereotypes of irrationality, terrorism, cruelty and barbarism' (1995: 185) and \nthat these films 'contextaulised within a political climate not only celebrate hostility \ntowards Iranians, they foster enmity and promote military aggression' (1995: 186). \nSimilarly Fuller in another study of US films found that depictions of Arabs centred \non 'predominant terrorist themes of kidnapping, actual violence, bombs, hijacking, \npolitical terrorism' and were embued with an 'underlying US overzealous brand of \npatriotism' (1995: 195). Shaheen in a study of more than 900 Hollywood films found \nthat Arabs were primarily presented as 'heartless, brutal, uncivilised religious \nfanatics' with a love for great wealth and lascivious fondness for white women. \nPalestinians he found were never presented positively as 'normal folk' and no \nAmerican films showed 'Palestinian families struggling to survive under occupation' \n(2003: 187). Instead Palestinians were frequently portrayed as 'ruthless terrorists' \nparticularly during the 1980s: \nFilms from the 1980s such as The Delta Force (1986) and Wanted: Dead or \nAlive (1987) present Lee Marvin, Chuck Norris and Rutger Hauer blasting \nPalestinians in the Mideast and in Los Angeles. In the 1990s, Charlie Sheen \nand Kurt Russell obliterate Palestinians in Lebanon and aboard a passenger jet, \nin Navy Seals (1990) and Executive Decision (1996) \n... \nSeven films, including \nTrue Lies (1994) and Wanted: Dead or Alive (1987) project the Palestinian as \na nerve gassing nuclear terrorist. In more than eleven movies including Haýf \nMoon Street (1986), Terror in Beverly Hills (198 8), and Appointment with \n23 \nDeath (1988), Palestinian evildoers injure and physically threaten Western \nwomen and children \n... \nThe reader should pay special attention to Black Sunday \n(1977), Hollywood's first major movie showing Palestinians terrorising and \nkilling Americans on US soil. Telecast annually the week of Super Bowl \nSunday the movie presents Dahlia, a Palestinian terrorist, and her cohort Fasil. \nThey aim to massacre 80,000 Superbowl spectators, including the American \nPresident, a Jimmy Carter lookalike. (2003: 187) \nClearly researchers have employed very different methodologies in assessing \nhow the Israel-Palestine conflict has been portrayed in the media. However some \nareas of consensus can be located. Most of the research appears to suggest that the \nIsraeli perspective tends to be more heavily featured than the Palestinian and that \nPalestinians have been portrayed in a worse light generally than Israelis, with their \ngrievances rarely explained. Some American commentators have suggested that the \nfact that Israel is a US ally partly explains the preference in coverage. Others have \nsuggested that the imbalance is a result of Israel's more developed system of public \nrelations. The research into popular culture representations suggests that many motion \npictures reinforce the most negative image of Palestinians as 'ruthless terrorists'. \nFactors Affecting the Production of News \nIn chapter four I discuss the various constraints and forces which shape the contours \nof news reporting of the conflict. However before that I want to review the literature \nin this area. Researchers have approached the subject from a number of different \nperspectives. Some have adopted a political economy approach focusing on the \nimpact of commercial pressures on the production of news. Others have examined the \nrelationship between journalists and sources, questioning who gets to speak and who \nis denied the opportunity to air their perspective. Within this tradition can also be \nadded research which examines how public relations and political advertising has \naffected the interaction of journalists and sources. Another approach has been to look \nat the professional and institutional values that journalists profess to uphold and how \nthese affect reporting, chiefly among these the BBC and its ethos of 'impartiality'. \nOther researchers have examined how news coverage can be constrained by a nation's \n24 \nforeign policy and how state and corporate actors can place pressure on media \norganisations to curtail critical coverage. Another strand of research has examined \nhow lack of specialist knowledge and the formalised nature of journalism training can \neffect news coverage, whilst another approach, which looks at cultural contexts and \nvalue systems, has examined how j oumalists are influenced by society's particular \ncultural mores and traditions in determining what is newsworthy and how to frame \nissues. I will begin this review by examining the effects of commercial pressures to \nmaximize audiences. \nCommercial Imperatives \nA number of commentators have stressed the pressures and constraints placed on \nmedia organisations by their need to maximise audiences and ensure profitability (e. g. \nMiliband, 1973; Golding & Elliot, 1980; Curran & Seaton, 2004; Philo, 1995: \nBarnett, 1998; Herman & Chomsky, 1988; Sparks, 1999). Curran and Seaton note \nhow the need to deliver mass audiences to advertisers serves to skew programmes \ntowards: \n... \na preference for 'entertainment' as opposed to 'serious' \nprogrammes \n... \nCommercial pressures have also led programme makers to \nemphasize the personal and human interest aspects of documentary stories. \nThus structural social problems are treated in the form of individual case \nstudies. This kind of audience reaches a wider audience, particularly amongst \nyoung women, than other documentary styles. The prominence given to \ncertain types of programmes on commercial television is a direct consequence \nof the pressures generated by the advertising for the production of certain \ntypes of audiences. (Curran & Seaton, 2004: 188-189) \nWhat are sometimes referred to as 'news values' can be seen partly as a \nconsequence of commercial pressures to produce bulletins which grab audiences. In \nMaking the News Golding and Elliot suggest that two of the most important 'news \nvalues' are visual attractiveness and entertainment. They cite comments from a former \nhead of ITN news who argued that the 'key to putting more hard news on the air \neffectively lies, I am sure in putting more pictures and less talk into news \n25 \nprograms \n... \nthe challenge is to turn hard factual important news into pictures' (cited in \nGolding & Elliot, 1980: 87). The authors also noted pressures towards 'softer' \ncoverage. They found that journalists regarded the 'human interest angle as an \nimportant way of making events palatable or comprehensible to audiences of \nbroadcast news', and that this sometimes created a tension between those journalists \nwho regarded news as a serious weighty issue and those who saw it Primarily as a \nproduct to be packaged and sold. \nHowever partly tempering commercial pressures in British j ournalism has \nbeen both the public service tradition of the BBC and a framework of public \nregulation. The Independent Broadcasting Authority, which was created at the outset \nof commercial broadcasting, had a strong public service ethos and insisted that quotas \nof news and current affairs programming be shown in prime time. Such expectations \nwere made conditions of franchise renewals despite pressure from broadcasters and \nadvertisers. 'Advertisers understand that current affairs and news programming is a \ncondition of the survival of the commercial television companies, there is no use \ncomplaining about it' remarked an advertising executive in the trade j ournal \nCampaign in 1979 (cited in Curran & Seaton, 2004: 18 1). However the 1980s and \n1990s saw moves towards the de-regulation of broadcasting in Britain and \nsubsequently the creation of a more market orientated system. Following the 1990 \nBroadcasting Act the Independent Broadcasting Authority was replaced by the \n'lighter touch' Independent Television Commission (ITC) whose remit was more \ngeared to preventing abuses than setting aspirational standards. The ITC had no role \nin fostering quality and could not insist that news or current affairs is broadcast in \npeak time. Stephen Barnett notes that even before the new body came into being \ntelevision executives were threatening to axe documentaries like World in Action \nunless they achieved very high ratings: \nEven before the new regime was implemented Carlton's then director of \nprogrammes, Paul Jackson, insisted that current affairs programmes could \nonly keep their peak time place through consistently high ratings. He told the \nDaily Telegraph in 1992: 'If World in Action were in 1993 to uncover three \nmore serious miscarriages of justice while delivering an audience of three, \nfour of five million, I would cut it. It isn't my job to get people out of prison' \n(Barnett, 1998: 82) \n26 \nDeregulation also led to a further concentration in the broadcast industry with \nan acceleration of the trend towards corporate oligopoly. Curan and Seaton note that \nthe competition amongst a small bands of giant conglomerates led to further pressures \nto cut costs and 'an almost inevitable lowering of standards, it is [for instance] \ncheaper to buy in agency news than send a reporter to the scene' (2004: 184). Barnett \nsuggests that this increase in competition together with a relaxation of regulation has \ninevitably led to programming becoming more consumerist. This process he argues \nhas been 'accelerated massively' by the new market research techniques underpinned \nby increases in the power of statistical analysis: \nThe result is a focus group mentality which has seeped from the media into \nbusiness and of course into politics. If focus groups tell us that one Brit carries \nthe weight of ten Americans, a hundred Germans or a thousand Algerians, we \nsteer our news bulletins and current affairs in that direction and adopt the same \nattitude as the Sun columnist Richard Littlejohn: 'Does anyone really give a \nmonkey's about what happens in Rwanda? If the Mbongo tribe wants to wipe \nout the Mbingo tribe then as far as I'm concerned that's a matter for them \n(Barnett, 1999: 84) \nBarnett suggests at its most extreme this approach can mean that broadcasters avoid \nprogramming which might challenge viewers' conventional wisdom in case such \nmaterial is alienating and cites comments from the Discovery Channel as to why they \nrejected the documentary Living Islam: 'For us Islam means terrorism, \nfundamentalism and the mistreatment of women. If you can't major on that then we \ndon't want to know. ' (cited in Barnett, 1999: 85). Colin Sparks suggests that the \ntrends towards deregulation and privatisation are eroding the space for public debate \nand collective action: \nThe destruction or at least erosion of the constitutive public life of society \nthrows the private sphere into even greater prominence. The disparate pursuits \nof the individual come to occupy the space once filled by the citizen. The \ngrowing number and importance of the fragmentary and specialised media of \nleisure pursuits are the concomitant of this economic process \n... \nAs the public \n27 \nsphere disappears its characteristic organs atrophy or transform themselves \n. \nThose that survive and the newly created replacements for the casualties are \nand more and more concerned with the narrow private world defined within a \npre-given framework of Politics, economy and society. (1991: 7 1) \nPhilo (1995) notes that the 1990 Broadcasting Act also changed the structure of the \nBBC, forcing the Corporation to commission a quarter of its original programming \nfrom outside companies. This introduction of market forces led to pressures to cost \ncosts and hence quality in news and current affairs. High quality news and current \naffairs programming require continuity in staff, in-depth knowledge and expertise, as \nwell as the ability to develop projects over long periods. However as Philo notes the \n4new pressures mean that the trend for television production as whole is now towards \nworking on a short time scale, often with independent companies on low budgets' \n(1995: 227) The free market then can act as a significant impediment to a critical and \ninformed journalism: \nTo develop television which is critical and which explains required in-depth \nstudy and commitment. These are not the priorities of the commercial market \nwhich in its most unregulated form will be concerned only with grabbing the \nattention of audiences and delivering them to advertisers at the lowest possible \ncost (1995: 229) \nSourcing \nHerman and Chomsky (1988) note that the mass media are drawn into a symbiotic \nrelationship with a powerful institutional sources by economic necessity and \nreciprocity of interest. The requirements to produce a set number of news bulletins \nevery day requires a constant flow of information. Fishman (1980) describes this as \nthe 'principle of bureaucratic affinity' whereby only a large institution can cater to the \ninformation needs of a media outlet. In practice this is achieved through stationing \nreporters on 'beats' and anticipating future events through the use of the 'news diary' \n(Golding and Elliot, 1980). Journalistic 'beats' serve to place institutional sources, \noften state bureaucrats in a powerful structural position as suppliers of official \ninformation and statistics. Many studies have suggested that news generation mainly \n28 \ninvolves the interaction of journalists and government bureaucrats and is essentially \n'passive'. For instance, Hess (198 1) in his study of Washington correspondents found \nthat j ournalists used no documents in approximately three quarters of their stories. \nOfficial sources tend to be perceived as credible and trustworthy due to their status \nand prestige. Fishman suggests that this is because j ournalists uphold a 'normative \norder of knowers' in society, which can mean that officials' claims to knowledge are \nsometimes taken as factual (1980: 144). This he claims can lead to a 'moral division \nof labour: officials have and get the facts, reporters merely get them. ' (1980: 145). \nHerman and Chomsky (1988) suggest that such practices also have other advantages, \nsince if journalists want to utilise unofficial sources they have to check material \ncarefully to avoid possible libel suits. This, of course, serves to increase the costs of \nsuchjournalism. \nIn Britain the relationship between the state's information managers and \njournalists is formalised and controlled through the 'lobby system'. Here journalists \nare granted particular 'informational privileges' such as special access to official \ndocuments and briefings from officials: \nThe largest group of 'lobby correspondents' are the 140 political journalists \nbased at Westminster, who have their own rules and 'officers' to supervise the \nsystem. There are also smaller lobby groups covering areas such as education, \nindustry and defence. Lobby correspondents have other privileges such as \naccess to White Papers and Government documents before they are released to \nthe general public. Any who break the rules may have their lobby privileges \nwithdrawn. The system has been attacked by some j ournalists, especially \nAmerican, since instead of encouraging investigation it produces a reliance on \nthe government to provide pre-packaged information. (Glasgow Media Group, \n1985: 1) \nThe lobby system illustrates at least three key features of British journalism. Firstly \nthat 'political authorities can assume a consensus amongst most j ournalists on the \nrange of views that are to be featured in any 'serious' fashion' (Glasgow Media \nGroup, 1985: 3). The reliance on political sources ensures that debates then become \nframed and bounded by the political consensus at Westminster. Secondly that a \nhierarchy of authority and credibility exists, reflecting the class divisions within \n29 \nsociety, whereby official views are considered inherently more authoritative than \nthose offered by oppositional sources. In replying to this charge Richard Francis, the \nformer Director of News and Current Affairs at the BBC only served to confinn its \nvalidity: \nThe BBC's j ournalists do indeed find it natural to ask 'an important person'- a \nsenior civil servant or government minister, for instance- for they are the \npeople whose decisions largely determine how things will be run in our \ndemocracy (New Statesman, 20 April 1979, cited in Glasgow Media Group, \n1985: 2-3) \nThirdly the structural position of the state's public relations professionals and their \nmonopoly on the dissemination of public policy information hinders the ability of \njournalists to report critically on issues of public concern. As David Leigh notes: \nDeprived, in theory at least, of independent right of access to infort-nation \nabout public affairs, the j ournalists depends on what he is told as a favour. The \nfrequent reason for claiming secrecy on power-holders' operations is to allow \nthem to present their own unchallenged version of reality: the obverse of the \nsecrecy coin is always propaganda. From the point of view of a politician, the \nideal journalist is one who will accept misleading statements and disguise their \nsource. (Leigh, 1980: 33, cited in Glasgow Media Group 1995: 5) \nThe close professional and personal relationships linking j oumalists and official \nsources also gives those sources leverage through the use of threats and rewards in \nensuring j oumalistic compliance. They may encourage reporters to carry dubious \nstories or threaten to cut off information if other sources are consulted. \nHall et. al. (1978) have described the position of official sources as 'primary \ndefiners' due to both their institutional legitimacy as elected representatives, and the \nroutine practices and values of journalists. Hall et. al. argue that 'primary definers' are \nroutinely 'over-accessed' by the media and are able to establish the definition of the \ntopic in question and map out the terms of debate. It is argued that this definition of \nthe scope and terms of an issue then comes to pre-structure any further discussions \nwithin the media, and future commentators must work within this framework of \n30 \ndebate. However this theory has been criticised on a number of grounds. Some have \nargued that it fails to take account of the effects of commercial imperatives and \njournalistic cultures. Others have attacked it for presenting a model of source access \nthat is 'structurally over-determined' and unable to deal with situations where \n'primary definers' lose control of the agenda (Schlesinger, 1990; Dalghren, 1995; \nSchlesinger & Tumbler, 1994; Davis, 2000). \nPublic Relations \nAlthough institutional elites may, due to their structural position, have privileged \naccess as sources, they also heavily utilise the services of public relations \nprofessionals (PRPs) to manage their messages. The UK public relations industry has \nbeen grown at an unprecedented rate since the 1980s, with annual growth rates of 20- \n25 percent during most of that decade (Davis, 2000). Although the recession at the \nend of the 1980s signaled a slowdown, the period from 1993 onwards has again \nwitnessed a rapid expansion in fee income for consultancies (Davis, 2000). The \nprimary users of the PR sector have been corporate and governmental clients. As a \nnumber of commentators have noted the fortunes of the PR sector and the \nConservative Party in the 1980s were closely linked (Miller & Dinan, 2000; Franklin, \n1994; Philo, 1995). The Conservative Party became reliant on PR firms for both the \nselling of privatisation policies and election support, as well as for legitimation and \nthe management of public opinion in the face of a number of crises. These included \nthe decline in the manufacturing sector and rises in unemployment (Philo, 1995), the \nFalklands conflict (Glasgow Media Group, 1985), counter-insurgency campaigns in \nNorthern Ireland (Miller, 1994), and the 1984/5 Miner's Strike (Jones, 1986). \nResearch commissioned by the Institute of Public Relations (IPR) in 1994 showed \nthat professional public relations continues to be dominated by corporate and \ngovernmental clients. Only 9 percent of PRPs work for non-profit organisations (more \nthan half of which are business trade bodies). No Unions and oppositional political \ngroups featured in the IPR survey. Of consultancy work which comprises 47 percent \nof the total, the vast ma ority (over 90 percent) is commissioned by corporate clients \nseeking to improve their consumer, corporate, financial, trade and government \nrelations. Oppositional groups who wish to contest the agenda with powerful \n31 \ngovernment or corporate sources are likely to find themselves out-resourced in the PR \nbattle both in terms of manpower and financial clout. As Davis (2000) notes this \nconfers significant advantages to the better resourced side: \nMore PR resources mean more PR contacts, greater output of information \nsubsidies, multiple modes of communication, and continuous media \noperations. Even though smaller organisations are increasingly drawn to using \nPR consultancies and employing PRPs most continue to be effectively \nexcluded by the high costs \n... \nIn effect the 'costs of market entry' into the \nprofessional PR world once again restrict full participation by smaller \nopposition organisations. These extreme differences in economic resources \nmean well-resourced organisations can inundate the media and set the agenda \nwhile the attempts of resource-poor organisations become quickly \nmarginalised. (Davis, 2000: 48) \nIn Northern Ireland Miller (1994) notes the disparity in PR resources between \nSinn Fein, with five voluntary press staff and a budget of f 7000, competing against a \ngovernment information service employing 145 PR staff and equipped with a budget \nof f, 20 million. Davis (1998) noted that public service trade unions striving to prevent \ngovernment cuts and privatisations were comprehensively and consistently out\u0002resourced by both corporations and government departments during the 1980s. For \ninstance, Jones (1986) in his study of press coverage of the 1984/5 Miner's strike \nnoted that during the conflict the National Coal Board spent f4.5 million on \nadvertising and increased its press staff from 6 to 25. \nIt has been suggested that recent changes in the economic structure of the \nmedia industry are making journalists more dependent on the output of professional \nPR. The deregulation of media industries in the 1980s together with the introduction \nof new technologies and the introduction of competition into public service \nbroadcasting have all contributed to a media environment under tremendous pressure \nto cut costs. Tunstall (1996) argues that such pressures have led to a fall in the level of \ninvestigative j ournalism and an increased dependency on news sources. Tunstall cites \nevidence that journalists now have to produce three times as much copy as in the \n1960s, with no equivalent increase in resources. Such strictures, he maintains, have \nled journalists to become less investigative and increasingly reliant on PRPs to \n32 \nprovide them with 'information subsidies' (Sigal, 1973; Gandy, 1980; Fishman, 1980; \nHerman & Chomsky, 1988). Institutional sources are keen to subsidise the costs of \nnews gathering by employing PRPs to manage the flow and presentation of \ninformation because this serves to reinforce their position as primary sources and \nmakes it more difficult for under-resourced oppositional sources to compete: \nIn effect, the large bureaucracies of the powerful subsidise the mass media \nand gain special access by their contribution to reducing the media's costs of \nacquiring the raw materials of, and producing news. The large entities that \nprovide this subsidy become 'routine' news sources and have privileged access \nto the gates. Non-routine sources must struggle for access, and may be ignored \nby the arbitrary actions of the gatekeepers. (Herman & Chomsky, 1988: 22) \nChanges in the relationship between j ournalists and sources are difficult to \nestimate not least because it is in the interests of both parties, that the terms of \nrelationship remain as veiled as possible. However according to Davis 'it is evident \nthat both sources and j ournalists have become transformed in their relations by what, \nin effect, amounts to a massive transfer of news-gathering resources, away from \n'independent' journalists and towards partisan sources' (2000: 44). Although this can \nclearly be seen in the rise to prominence of a certain type of PRP the 'spin doctor', \nthese are 'just one aspect of a general transition that has seen the erosion of the lines \nthat traditionally separated the participants in the media production process' (2000: \n45). \nDespite the advantages enjoyed by powerful institutional sources oppositional \nsources have also sought to use PR strategies to get their message across. \nEnvironmental organisations and NGOs have invested in PR facilities (Lowe & \nGoyder, 1983; Anderson, 1991; Hansen, 1993) as have pressure groups and trade \nassociations involved in the criminal justice area (Ericson et. al., 199 1; Schlesinger & \nTumbler, 1994), gay and lesbian advocacy groups (Miller & Williams, 1993), and \nparamilitaries in Northern Ireland (Miller, 1994). Charities and the voluntary sector \nhave also increased their use of PR. Deacon (1996) in a survey of voluntary sector \nfound that 31 percent of organisations employed press officers, 43 percent used the \nservices of external PR agencies and 56 percent monitored the media. In organisations \nwith annual budgets in excess of f250,000 the figures increased to 57 percent, 81 \n33 \npercent, and 78 percent. Research by Davis (1998) found that two-thirds of unions \nhad at least one part-time press officer, a quarter used PR consultancies and 57 \npercent used other agencies to monitor the media. A number of charities including the \nNational Children's Home, St. John's Ambulance and the Royal British Legion have \nall won IPR awards in the 1990s for the strength of their PR campaigns (Davis, 2000). \nOther organisations such as the Terence Higgins Trust (Miller & Williams, 1993), and \nFriends of the Earth (Anderson, 1993) have through careful and skilful use of PR \ntechniques improved their credibility and accessibility as news sources. Whilst \npowerful institutional sources do possess privileged access, there may be times when \noppositional groups are able to contest and even overturn elite dominance. For \ninstance, this may be possible when the political centre is divided. \nPressure, Intimidation, Censorship and the Law \nIf the use of public relations, with its attendant benefits for compliant j ournalists, can \nbe seen as the 'sweet stuff then the obverse, the 'fear stuff is the application of \npressure or 'flak' to j oumalists and news organisations. Chomsky & Herman (198 8) \npoint to the use of letters, petitions, lawsuits, legislation, speeches and threats by state \nand corporate actors to try to pressurise and intimidate media outlets. This pressure \ncan be applied directly by, for instance, threatening not to renew a broadcaster's \nfranchise, or can be more indirect by appeals to constituents such as stockholders, \ndirectors and advertisers. The funding and use of think tanks is another method for \ncreating pressure. In America right-wing pressure groups such as Freedom House, and \nAccuracy in Media (AIM), have been consistent in their criticism of the media for its \n'persistent liberal bias' and failure to represent the interests of business favourably. \nChomsky & Herman suggest that the function of such groups are 'to harass the media \nand put pressure on them to follow the corporate agenda and a hard-line, right-wing \nforeign policy' (1988: 27). For instance, when the Reagan administration was \ncriticised in the media for supporting the 'dirty wars' in Central America in 1980s, \nFreedom House produced a report denouncing the imbalance of coverage in the \nmedia. \nIn the UK Philo has noted that during the 1980s the Conservative party \nfrequently pressurised the BBC because of what it considered unfavourable coverage. \nCriticism of government policy by the Corporation and the prominence given to the \n34 \nproblems of unemployment, poverty and Northern Ireland angered the Tory party who \nstrongly criticised the institution. The party with the help of Lord Chalfont, set up its \nown Media Monitoring Unit which in its reports echoed the complaints of AIM in the \nUS, that the BBC was 'persistently biased in favour of the Left' (cited in Philo 1995: \n202). The reports rated every programme viewed with classification of possible bias. \nProgrammes such as Panorama and World in Action were singled out for particular \ncriticism. An episode of World in Action examining the impact of unemployment was \nclassified as 'attacking the Right and promoting the Left' (cited in Philo, 1995; 202). \nDuring the Falklands war the Conservative party was also very critical of the \nBBC. A Panorama programme which featured Labour and Conservative opposition \nto the was branded by one Tory MP as an 'odious subversive travesty', and the \nCorporation was forced to admit that 'it was not neutral' in the conflict (Glasgow \nMedia Group, 1985: 127). At the time of the Gulf War the BBC also adopted a \ncautious approach. In a report on the allied bombing of the Al-Amiraya bunker in \nwhich hundreds of civilians were killed it was repeatedly stressed that the causalities \ncould well have been Iraqi propaganda. Philo and McLaughlin commenting on this \nnoted that: \nIn the period of the war both the BBC and ITN were afraid of being accused by \nBritish politicians of showing 'Iraqi propaganda'. Such propaganda might \ninclude anything that gained sympathy for the Iraqi population. Consequently \nin the early days of the war, pictures of civilian casualties provided by the \nIraqis were accompanied by heavy qualifications suggesting that they might \nnot be authentic. These qualifications reduced the emotional impact of the \npictures and protected the broadcasters against future criticism. (1995: 152) \nBroadcasting was also attacked repeatedly over its coverage of Northern \nIreland. The documentary Death on the Rock which dealt with the killing of three \nunarmed IRA personnel in Gibraltar and the disinformation campaign intended to \njustify the action, greatly angered the Tory Party, and it was widely suspected that the \ndecision by Thames TV to show the documentary was an important factor in its \nfranchise not being renewed. As Miller notes in his examination of government \ninformation control during the conflict, intimidation was often backed by the full use \nof the State's legal powers: \n35 \nTo support the PR effort there have been official attempts to impose tight \ncontrols on media practice. This is done, both by the use of the law and by the \nroutine use of government intimidation of the media. In the former case, the \nnumber and severity of powers available to circumscribe the media have \nsteadily increased since the 1970s. they include the Prevention of Terrorism \nact, the Emergency Provisions Act, The Official Secrets Act and the Police \nand Criminal Evidence Act, which have all been passed and/or tightened since \nthe 1970s (0 Maolain 1989). In particular the 1989 revision of the PTA allows \nthe police to demand access to any j ournalistic material should they believe it \nis likely to have 'substantial value' in a terrorist investigation. The 1989 \nofficial secrets Act further narrowed the sphere of debate by making it illegal \nfor anyone associated with intelligence or security matters to speak or be \nreported in the media. No public-interest defence is permissible. (1994 : \n47) \nThe Conservative government also resorted to direct censorship in the conflict, \nwith the introduction of the broadcasting ban in October 1988, which prevented the \ntransmission of statements from the members or supporters of eleven Irish political \nand military organisations. Miller notes that this was 'the first, and so far, the only use \nof this power since the beginning of British broadcasting history directly and overtly \nto rule out a whole class of political viewpoints' (1994: 48) \nMedia executives have stated that the struggle between broadcasters and the \nConservative government during the 1980s did take its toll. The former Assistant \nDirector-General of the BBC Alan Protheroe commenting on the atmosphere created \nby government pressure referred to fortnightly 'ritual crucifixions' when he would be \ndragged across the coals by the Board of Governors (World in Action; 28 February \n1988, cited in Philo, 1995: 206). A producer who had spent more than twenty years in \nthe BBC claimed that: \nThe Conservatives used a kind of salami-cutting technique by attacking the \nBBC day after day and constantly put the management into a defensive \nposture \n.... \nWe were self-censoring as a result of our superiors constantly saying \nccan you rest it for a while? ' (cited in Philo, 1995; 206) \n36 \nThe Conservative Party also strengthened its position vis-a-vis the BBC by \nappointing members of the Board of Governors who were sympathetic to their \nposition. These included Malcolm McAlpine whose company had donated more than \n000,000 to the Conservative party, and Stuart Young brother of the David Young, a \ncabinet minister. However these attempts to intimidate the Corporation were \ncontested. When the Conservative Home Secretary asked the BBC to ban a \nprogramme in its Real Lives series dealing with a Loyalist and Republican \nrepresentative in Northern Ireland the ban was confirmed by the Board of Governors. \nHowever this led to strikes at the BBC and ITN and the programme was eventually \nshown. \nNew Technology \nThe last two decades have seen the emergence of host of new communicative \ntechnologies such as mobile phones, satellite and digital television, and the internet. \nAll of these have affected the practices of journalism in different ways. The \nemergence of cable and satellite channels devoted to news, together with pressures to \ncut costs have meant that journalists are having to service more media outlets. This \ninevitably means that they are likely to have less time available to research \nbackground and provide context. The arrival of the global 24 hour rolling news \nchannels at the beginning of the 1990s also coincided with the arrival of satellite \ntechnology allowing correspondents to report in real time from any part of the globe. \nBarnett suggests that the ability to 'be there' instantaneously in breaking news events \ncan push coverage towards the dramatic at the expense of a deeper understanding: \nIn foreign reporting mobile satellite technology guarantees that no part of the \nworld is inaccessible to TV cameras, but that reporting is instantaneous. The \nresult can often be dramatic, live pictures which provide little hard news and \nobscure the absence of any informed or critical reflection, as in the Gulf War \n(Barnett, 1998: 80). \nAs Eldridge noted the emergence of CNN during the Gulf War and in particular the \nlive reports on the Scud missile attacks on Israel on the first night of the war pushed \ndrama in news to new levels: \n37 \nThese CNN reports had a raw quality about them. They were unfiltered \nhappenings. We can see on reporter know another over as the sirens wail out \nin Dharan and they instinctively duck to avoid the anticipated missile. At \ntimes, because of the noise or because their voices are muffled by gas masks \nwe can barely hear what they say. But what kind of knowledge is this? It was \nfairly described by one critic on BBC2's Late Show as 'immediacy without \nunderstanding, drama without information' (22 January 199 1). And Jonathon \nAlter, media critic for Newsweek said that is had come to be regarded as \n'good television' in that it had the quality of cinema-verite- something real \nthat's going on. (Glasgow University Media Group, 1993: 11) \nThe last decade has also seen a huge increase in the amount of agency news \navailable instantly to news rooms via live feeds. The former head of news gathering at \nthe BBC executive Chris Cramer noted back in 1995 that the amount of agency \nmaterial pumped into the Corporation's newsroom was enormous: \nThe sheer volume of news pictures flooding in through our front doors these \ndays is almost impossible to handle. I 10 feeds a day at the BBC, six or seven \nhundred a week and growing all the time. The choice of agencies and other \npicture sources is already a headache for most of our newsroom and news \nmanagers \n... \nthe picture flood as I call it is a real tribute to the three \ninternational news agencies... but it can cloud our judgement. (Address to \nMontreaux. International Television Symposium, 13 June 1995, cited in \nPatterson, 1996: 147) \nIn recent years the news agencies have moved from the provision of raw \nfootage to providing news packages involving full narration as well as pictures. These \nare an increasingly attractive option to broadcasters under pressure to cut costs, and \nthere is a danger that such pressures are forcing newsrooms to become increasingly \nreliant on agency material The BBC's Chris Cramer has denied that the Corporation \nin moving in this direction and argued that major broadcasters such as the BBC only \n'buy agency material as fire insurance' (Broadcast, 30/6/1994). However others have \nsuggested that having so many easily accessible news feeds is encouraging bad habits \n38 \nin j ournalism. For instance Williams Points to how much j oumalism training is \nstructured around accessing such news services and suggests that this encourages a \npassive and uncritical approach: \nNew technology has made the process of finding out a more sedentary affair. \nRather than telling j ournalists to get out there and 'find out about the patch' by \ntalking to people, the teaching newsrooms of today are wired up to an array of \ninformation services that pump in material; while being linked to local media \nof one kind or another that put across their own news and information \nservices. The result is that passivity and spoon-feeding are almost built into \nthe process of education. (1999: 274) \nCultural Contextsl Value Systems \nAnother approach to studying how news production has been to focus on how \njournalists select what is newsworthy based on the cultural context of a society. This \nis particularly noticeable in the work of news agencies who have to cater to many \ndifferent markets and require an in-depth knowledge of what is popular in each. The \nformer head of Worldwide Television News has commented that: \nA lot of the news stories are of interest to regions. The world breaks down into \nthe same kind of news affiliations as a country or city \n... \nIn a town like New \nYork you've got all the different newspapers appealing to different agendas. \nThe same thing happens in global ternis. The Scandinavians like certain kinds \nof stories and the Italians go for certain others which are based on their history \nand culture and the things that are topical in their own societies. (cited in \nPatterson, 1996: 352) \nHoggart in his introduction to Bad News talked of the 'cultural air we breathe, \nthe whole ideological atmosphere of society' which delineates what can and cannot be \nsaid. This can be thought of as a kind of para-idology, the unquestioned and unnoticed \nbackground assumptions through which news is gathered and framed. Gans (1979) \nhas put forward a list for American journalism which include ethnocentrism, altruistic \n39 \ndemocracy, responsible capitalism, small town pastorialism, individualism and \nmoderation as core unquestioned values. Golding and Murdock suggest that \njournalists have a conception of 'what is acceptable in their society' and that this is \ninfluenced by both class and organisational factors: \nOther policies current in different newsrooms, some explicit, others more \ncovert but generally recognised could similarly be traced to journalists3 sense \nof what was acceptable in their society. Not that this sense was based on a \nsampling of national opinion. The sample such as it was, came filtered both \nthrough the journalists' personal experiences as members of a particular \neducated elite and through their occupational experience of working in \nbroadcasting organisations whose major constituencies, government, \npoliticians, and interest groups had clear ideas not so much of what public \nopinion was as what it ought to be (Golding & Elliot, 1980: 69) \nThis approach also helps to explain the use of generalised images and stereotypes \nsuch as 'predatory stockbrokers' or 'hard drinking factory workers' which transcend \nstructures of ownership or patterns of work relationships. Journalists are drawing on a \nset of stereotypes and culturally given assumptions which they have in part created. \nHowever this can be a problem especially in relation to foreign news where \nsometimes such reporting can reinforce stereotypes. Golding and Elliot point out \nbroadcasters draw on cliches and stereotypes from their own culture when reporting \non the developing world: \nIn European media, stereotypes of life and customs in foreign parts play a \nlarge part in the treatment of stories from the Third World. Excitable mobs of \nLatin Americans, exotic primitives in Africa, incomprehensible mystics in the \nEast continue to populate news bulletins not because of any malicious intent to \nperpetrate pernicious myths but in an innocent attempt to render usable and \ncomprehensible the range of data which is the raw material of news (1980: \n74). \n'Innocent' or not the consequences of using stereotypes because they are \nculturally recognisable can be damaging. Philo in a discussion of research examining \n40 \npublic attitudes to the developing world pointed to television coverage of the 1994 \nRwandan genocide where rather than sketching out the complex social and political \nfactors behind the atrocities j oumalists fell back on cliches like 'tribal passions', \ninterspersing such comments, with 'shots of Africans dancing in grass skirts at a \nborder post' (2002: 176). As the Channel Four correspondent Lindsey Hilsum. pointed \nout journalists found it difficult to understand the political roots of the genocide \nbecause of their own preconceptions about Africa, and so fell back on stereotypes. \nHowever as Philo notes this is likely to raise audience understanding of the \ndeveloping world. When the author explained to a focus group that Hutu military \nregime had also killed foreigners and university staff, one viewer commented that 'oh \nyou don't think of them as having universities' (cited in Philo, 2002: 176). By \ndrawing on culturally recognisable stereotypes journalists risk reinforcing viewers' \nignorance and prejudices rather than actually helping the public understand the world \nbetter. \nJournalism Training and Critical Skills \nIn a review of the development of journalism education in Britain, Williams notes the \nenduring tension between the need to impart the vocational skills of the profession \nand the pressure to confirm to the 'traditional groves of academe' (1999: 274). When \nthe first j ournalism courses were introduced in the early 1970s established j ournalists \nwere suspicious of the idea that universities could provide an alternative education \ncomparable to what they would learn 'on the job'. As the author notes this was still \nthe era of the 'dirty overcoat and the nose for news' (1999: 273). Academics were \nalso suspicious of the new discipline doubting whether it had the necessary academic \ncredentials. Since the 1970s Williams observes that journalism training has become \nmore sPecialised and more tied into the use of new technology and the 'mechanics of \nproduction'. The author also notes that the orientation of many would-be journalists \nhas shifted from a socially conscious focus towards one geared more to seeking 'fame \nand fortune'. He argues that this is partly a consequence of a the increasing insecurity \nand casualisation of the profession together with the move towards a more \nconsumerist culture where being famous carries an especially high premium, but also \nbecause the content of journalism studies courses is 'unlikely to stimulate critical \nawareness of key social issues' (1999: 274). \n41 \nWilliams also claims that journalism studies courses are unable to provide \naspiring reporters with the necessary critical skills required to evaluate the veracity of \ninformation. This he suggests is a function of the two dominant epistemological \napproaches inherent in contemporary journalism studies courses, the journalistic and \nthe postmodern. Since the 1980s courses have moved away from teaching the \ntraditional sociology of the media and moved over to teaching a cultural studies \napproach informed increasing by a postmodern perspective. However the postmodem \napproach which eschews the use of empirical evidence and advocates a relativist and \nsubjective attitude towards truth claims, is unable to critically evaluate the \ninformation that j ournalists encounter when researching stories or talking to sources. \nWilliams maintains that the traditional j ournalistic approach with its largely uncritical \nreliance on information provided by sources is little better suited to the task. \nJournalists, Williams suggests, are 'encouraged to replicate the opinions and \ninterpretations of their informers, without the means or methods to verify the truth of \nwhat they have been told', and since this is 'done in the name of objectivity the \ncentral totem of the profession, they cannot be told to scrutinise the sources to the \ndegree they should be scrutinised' (1999: 276). The upshot of this is that j ournalists \ntend to end up providing a 'highly selective reproduction of the dominant view' \nwithout critical reflection of evaluation (1999: 277). To foster a more critical and \ninformed j ournalism Williams suggests that the j ournalism studies curriculum needs \nto be greatly expanded: \nIt is clear that j ournalists need to know about how society works in order to \nreport on and make sense of events. Thus they require knowledge of crime, \nwork and employment, the global economy, agri-business, ecology and the \nenvironment, migration and race, contemporary politics, war and conflict, the \ndeveloping world and many other elements of 'social studies'. In order to \nunderstand, contextualise and make sense of the range of claims and \ninterpretations in the nitty-gritty daily routines of journalism, knowledge and \nunderstanding of key social issues are essential (1999: 278) \nOthers have put forward a different set of disciplines that could be integrated into \njournalism studies courses. For instance Brian Winston (1966) has suggested that \nmedia law, history and ethics together with political theory, should be core elements \n42 \nof j ournalism. training. Boulding (1966) has stressed the importance of j ournalists \nbeing trained to understand and evaluate information in databases and libraries and \nother reference sources which can then be utilised in developing stories, whilst \nMedsger (1996) in line with Williams has stressed that the 'unique public service \nethos' of journalism should be an integral aspect of training. \nThis review has illustrated the complex matrix of factors which shape the contours of \nnews coverage. I now want to move on in the next chapter to a review of the various \nperspectives on the history of the conflict. \n43 \nChapter 2 Histories of the Conflict \nA nation is a group ofpeople united by a mistaken view about the past and a hatred of \ntheir neighbours \nErnest Renan (cited in Shlaim, 2004) \nZionist Roots and the First Wave of Jewish Immigration into Palestine \nThe American historian Howard Sachar (1977) traces the contemporary emergence of \nZionist thought to the European Rabbis, Judah Alkalai and Zvi Hirsh Kalischer, who \nfrom the 1830s onwards stressed the need for Jews to return to the Holy Land as a \nnecessary prelude to the Redemption and the second coming of the Messiah. Sachar \nargues that such messianic exhortations did not immediately or widely take root \namongst European Jews. However he suggests that by the 1870s societies generally \nknown as Chovevei Zion- 'Lovers of Zion' had formed across Russia, which viewed \nPalestine as a site for national renewal and a refuge from anti-Semitism. \nIn 1881 following the assassination of Tsar Alexander 11 large numbers of \nJews were killed in a series of Russian pogroms. By 1914 up to two million Jews had \nfled Russia to escape persecution. The vast majority sought sanctuary in the United \nStates but 25,000 arrived in Palestine in two waves of immigration in 1882-4 and \n1890-1. At the time the Jewish population in Palestine was small. The official \nOttoman census of 1878 had put the total at 15,011 living amongst a combined \nMuslim/Christian population of 447,454 (McCarthy, 1990). Relations between the \nnew Jewish immigrants and the native population were mixed. Jewish settlements \nwere built on land that was purchased from absentee effendi landlords. Often the \nlocals who had tended the land were evicted with the help of Turkish police and this \nled to resentment and violence. Some Zionists such as Ahad Aham were very critical \nof the way the settlers gained control of the land and treated the local population. In \n1891 he argued that the settlers 'treat the Arabs with hostility and cruelty and, \nunscrupulously deprive them of their rights, insult them without cause and even boast \nof such deeds; and none opposes this despicable and dangerous inclination. ' (1923: \n107, cited in Hirst, 1977: 24). There was also evidence that the two groups were able \nto accommodate each other because the settlers also brought benefits. They provided \nemployment opportunities, access to medical care, the loan of modem equipment, and \n44 \na market for produce. Sachar reports that in the 1890s the agricultural settlement of \nZichron Ya'akov employed more than a thousand Arabs working for 200 Jews. The \nformer Guardian Middle East correspondent David Hirst (1977) argues that the \nbeginning of the twentieth century brought a new more militant type of settler to \nPalestine, inspired by the ideas of Theodor Herzl and determined to 'redeem the land' \nand 'conquer labour'. The Jewish National Fund, set up to manage Jewish land \npurchases, decreed in 1901 that all land it purchased could never be resold or leased to \ngentiles, and settlers began to boycott Arab labour (Hirst, 1977; Shafir, 1999). \nTheodor Herzl and the Emergence of Political Zionism \nTheodor Herzl, who is commonly regarded as the father of political Zionism, was a \nJewish Austro-Hungarian j ournalist and playwright. He had been deeply affected by \nthe virulent anti-Semitism sweeping across Europe, and as a journalist for the Vienna \nnewspaper Neue Freie Presse had covered the notorious Dreyfus trial in Paris, where \na Jewish officer was falsely charged with passing secrets to the Germans. Herzl felt \nthat a central issue for Jews was their dispersal across the Diaspora and their existence \nas a minority in each country they inhabited. This, Herzl argued, led to a dependence \non the host culture and a suppression of self-determination. Furthermore Herzl \nbelieved that widespread anti-Semitism meant that complete assimilation into \nEuropean society was an impossibility for most Jews. His solution as laid out in \n1896's Der Judenstaat or The Jewish State was for Jews to create their own state, in \nwhich they would constitute a majority and be able to exercise national self\u0002determination. In contrast to the 'practical Zionism' of the Jewish settlers who began \nto arrive in Palestine from 1882, Herzl adopted a political orientation, cultivating links \nwith prominent Imperial statesmen in an attempt to gain a charter for Jewish land \nsettlement. \nHerzl had two potential locations in mind for the prospective Jewish state, \nArgentina and Palestine. His diaries show that he was greatly influenced by the \nBritish imperialist Cecil Rhodes, and in particular the manner in which Rhodes had \ngained control of Mashonaland and Matabeleland from its inhabitants (Hirst, 1977). \nIn his diaries he suggests that the settlers should follow Rhodes' example and 'gently' \nexpropriate the native population's land and 'try to spirit the penniless population \nacross the border by procuring employment for it in the transit countries, while \n45 \ndenying it any employment in our own country' but that 'the process of expropriation \nand the removal of the poor must be carried out discreetly and circumspectly' (1960: \n88, cited in Hirst, 1977: 18). In order to further this aim Herzl sought out an imperial \nsponsor prepared to grant a settlement charter. He canvassed Germany's Kaiser, the \nOttoman Sultan and Britain's Joseph Chamberlain stressing to each the benefits that a \nJewish state and Jewish capital could bring. In 1901 Herz1 travelled to Constantinople \nand met the Sultan. Herzl offered Jewish capital to re-finance the Ottoman public debt \nin a failed attempt to gain a charter for the establishment of a Jewish Ottoman \nColonisation Association in Palestine. Bohm (193 5) claims that the third article of the \nproposed charter would have given the Jewish administration the right to deport the \nnative population from Palestine. Herzl then switched his attention to lobbying British \npoliticians. Hirst (1977) suggests that Herzl linked Zionist ambitions to British \nimperial interests, and tried to play on the anti-Semitism of certain British politicians \nby arguing that a Jewish homeland would lessen the flow of Jewish refugees fleeing \npogroms, into Britain. Herzl lobbied Lord Rothschild for the creation of Jewish \ncolonies in Cyprus, ' the Sinai Peninsula and Egyptian Palestine, but the plans met with \nresistance from the Egyptian authorities. In April 1903 Joseph Chamberlain suggested \nto Herzl that the Zionists should consider Uganda as a homeland. The proposal \nreceived a mixed reception from Zionists and was firmly rejected by the Zionist \nCongress in 1905 which ruled that colonisation should be confined to Palestine and its \nimmediate vicinity. Herzl died in 1904, and the task of forwarding political Zionism \npassed to Chaim Weizmann. \nThe Second Wave of Jewish Immigration into Palestine \n1904 saw the beginning of another wave of Jewish immigration into Palestine, again \nin response to Russian pogroms. The Israeli historian Ahron Bregman estimates \n35,000 arrived, and argues that these settlers were different from the previous \nimmigrants in that they sought to exclude Arab labour and were 'driven by a fierce \nsense of mission and bent on redeeming the land' (2003: 11). The Israeli sociologist \nGershon Shafir argues that the struggle for the 'conquest of labour' transformed \nJewish workers into 'militant nationalists' who 'sought to establish a homogenous \nJewish society' (1999: 8 8) Some Zionists began to stress the importance of armed \nforce in creating the Jewish homeland. Israel Zangwill, who had coined the Zionist \n46 \nslogan 'a land without people for a people without land', informed a meeting of \nZionists in Manchester in 1905 that '[We] must be prepared either to drive out by the \nsword the [Arab] tribes in possession as our forefathers did or to grapple with the \nproblem of a large alien population' (Zwangill cited in Morris, 2001: 140). \nThe Palestinians, as a subject population under Ottoman rule, were initially \ndeferential in their protests. Repeatedly during the 1890s members of the Palestinian \nelite unsuccessfully petitioned their imperial overlords in Constantinople to limit \nJewish immigration. The late nineteenth century was a period of growing pan-Arab \nawareness which had seen a renaissance, in the appreciation of Arab literature and \nculture. Ovendale argues that both the Ottoman Empire and the spread of Zionism \nwere seen as a threat to Arab development. He suggests that 'between 1909 and 1914 \nnationalist opposition in Palestine to Zionism grew: there were fears that if the Jews \nconquered Palestine the territorial unity of the Arab world would be shattered and the \nArab cause weakened. ' (1999: 12). By 1914 the Muslim intellectual Rashid Rida \nargued that the Palestinians had a choice. They could either come to an \naccommodation with the Zionists in which the Zionists, in return for concessions, \nwould put a limit on their ambitions or they could oppose them with arms: \nIt is incumbent upon the leaders of the Arabs- the local population -to do one \nof two things. Either they must reach an agreement with the leaders of the \nZionists to settle the differences between the interests of both parties \n... \northey \nmust gather all their forces to oppose the Zionists in every way, first by \nforming societies and companies, and finally by forming armed gangs which \noppose them by force. (Rida cited in Hirst, 1977: 32-33) \nThe Balfour Declaration and the British Mandate \nDuring the First World War the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire was widely \nanticipated and the Entente Powers began negotiating over contending territorial \nambitions. In 1916 negotiations between Britain, France and Russia (later to include \nItaly) led to the secretive Sykes-Picot agreement which sought to establish 'spheres of \ninfluence' for the European Powers within the region. However the agreement also \naccepted the realities of emergent Arab nationalism, and specified the recognition of \n47 \n4 an independent Arab State' or 'confederation of Arab States' within the region. \nBritish assurances of Arab independence after the defeat of the Axis Powers (which \nhad been pledged as a reward for Arab support during the First World War) can be \nfound in the correspondence between Sir Henry McMahon, British High \nCommissioner in Egypt and Sharif Husain, Emir of Mecca, who was recognised as \nthe Keeper of Islam's most holy places. 3 However these pledges by European Powers \nto strive for the recognition of Arab independence conflicted with British assurances \ngiven, at the time, to Zionist leaders that Britain would seek the establishment of a \nJewish homeland in Palestine. Zionist leaders established close links with prominent \nBritish politicians including Lloyd George, Arthur Balfour, Herbert Samuel and Mark \nSykes. In 1915 Samuel in a memorandum entitled the Future of Palestine proposed \n'the British annexation of Palestine [where] we might plant three or four million \nEuropean Jews' (Weisgal, 1944: 13 1, cited in United Nations, 1990). British support \nfor a Jewish homeland was made explicit in the Balfour Declaration of November \n1917: \nHis Majesty's Goverm-nent view with favour the establishment in Palestine of \na national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to \nfacilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that \nnothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of \nexisting non-Jewish communities in Palestine or the rights and political status \nenjoyed by Jews in any other country \nThe 'non-Jewish communities', which comprised the 89 per cent of the \npopulation who were Muslim and Christian, were angered by the declaration. 4 They \nnoted that it only spoke of their 'civil and religious rights' making no mention of \npolitical rights. Conversely for the Zionists the declaration was regarded as a triumph. \nThe Israeli historian Avi Shlaim, paraphrasing Chaim Weizmann, argues that it \n'handed the Jews a golden key to unlock the doors of Palestine and make themselves \nthe masters of the country' (2000: 7). The legality of the Balfour Declaration has \nsince been questioned by some legal experts (Linowitz, 1957; Cattan, 1973). \nAfter the First World War Britain, Great Britain was assigned control of \nPalestine, through the Mandates system governing the dismemberment of the \nOttoman Empire. In 1921 the British divided the area in two with the sector east of \n48 \nthe Jordan River becoming Transjordan and the area west of the river the Palestinian \nmandate. \nThe indigenous population of mandated Palestine feared mass Jewish \nimmigration would lead to the further colonisation of their country followed by their \nown subjugation. This view was shared by some prominent British politicians such as \nLord Curzon who on 26 January 1919, commented to Lord Balfour: 'I feel tolerably \nsure therefore that while Weizmann may say one thing to you, or while you may mean \none thing by a national home, he is out for something quite different. He contemplates \na Jewish State, a Jewish nation, a subordinate population of Arabs, etc. ruled by Jews; \nthe Jews in possession of the fat of the land, and directing the Administration \n... \nHe is \ntrying to effect this behind the screen and under the shelter of British trusteeship. ' \n(British Government, Foreign Office, 1919a, cited in Ingrams, 1972: 58). Some \nmembers of the British establishment believed that by supporting the Jewish National \n5 home they were directly violating the terms of the mandate. Others seemed less \nconcerned about the opinions of the Arab population. Chaim Weizmann claimed that \na British official had told him that in Palestine 'there are a few hundred thousand \nnegroes but that is a matter of no significance' (Heller, 1985 cited in Chomsky, 1992: \n435) \nBetween 1919 and 1926 the Jewish presence in Palestine swelled with the \narrival of a further 90,000 immigrants (Bregman, 2003). The community also became \nincreasingly militarised, with the creation of what Shlaim describes as an 'iron wall' \nof impregnable strength designed to protect Jewish settlements from Arab attacks. \nThe concept of the 'iron wall' had first been deployed by Vladimar Jabotinsky, the \nleader of the Revisionist movement. 6 Jabotinsky was convinced that the indigenous \nArabs would not accept the Zionist project voluntarily and advocated the creation of \nan 'iron wall' that the local population would be unable to breach: \nIf you wish to colonise a land in which people are already living, you must \nprovide a garrison for the land, or find a benefactor who will maintain the \ngarrison on your behalf. Zionism is a colonising adventure and therefore it \nstands or falls by the question of armed forces. (Jabotinsky cited in Masalha, \n1992: 45) \n49 \nThe Zionists also substantially increased their land holdings. Agricultural land \nwas purchased from absentee Arab landlords and the peasants who tended and lived \non them, were evicted. The 1919 American King-Crane Commission, which had been \nsent to Palestine to assess local opinion, reported in their discussions with Jewish \nrepresentatives, that 'the Zionists looked forward to a practically complete \ndispossession of the present non-Jewish inhabitants of Palestine, by various forms of \npurchase' (British Government, 1947: 3, cited in Laqueur & Rubin, 1984: 29) The \nZionists also increasingly boycotted Arab labour. The British Hope Simpson \nCommission had criticized the Zionist Keren ha-Yesod employment agreements as \ndiscriminatory and pointed to Article seven which stipulated that 'The settler hereby \nundertakes that \n... \nif and whenever he may be obliged to hire help, he will hire Jewish \nworkmen only' and Article eleven which stated that 'the settler undertakes \n... \nnot to \nhire any outside labour except Jewish labourers\" (British Government, Cmd. 3686: \n52-3, cited in United Nations, 1990). The tensions created by this labour exclusivism \nthe Commission reported, constituted 'a constant and increasing source of danger to \nthe country. ' (British Government, Cmd. 3686: 55, cited in United Nations, 1990). \nThroughout the 1920s Arab hostility to the Zionist project manifested itself in \nincreasingly prolonged outbreaks of violence. In 1921 Arabs attacked Jews at Jaffa \nduring a May Day parade and the violence spread to other towns and the countryside. \nBy the time the British army brought the situation under control nearly 200 Jews and \n120 Arabs were dead or wounded. Britain set up a commission of inquiry to \ninvestigate the violence. The Haycraft Commission reported that the violence was \nspontaneous and anti-Zionist rather than anti-Jewish. The report blamed the Arabs for \nthe violence, but also pointed to Arab fears that the mass influx of Jewish immigrants \nwould lead to their subjugation. General William Congreve, the commander of \nBritish forces in the Middle East criticized Herbert Samuel's policy of trying to \nestablish a Jewish National home in Palestine in the face of the opposition from most \nof the population (Ovendale, 1999). Shortly afterwards the Arabs sent a petition to the \nLeague of Nations asking for democratic elections and independence for Palestine \n(Segev, 2001). In 1922 the British government published a White Paper which was \nintended to mollify Arab fears. It denied that the Balfour Declaration paved the way \nfor a Jewish State, and that the Arab population, culture and language would be \nsubordinated. It also proposed a legislative council made up of Jewish, Muslim and \nChristian representatives, a suggestion that was rejected by the Arabs. Hirst (1977) \n50 \nalleges that a large proportion (likely to give Jewish representatives a majority) of the \ncouncil would have been directly appointed by Britain, and that the Palestinians \nfeared that Zionist policies might be legitimized under a constitutional fagade. \nThe 1920s and 1930s saw more violent disturbances followed on each \noccasion by Commissions of Enquiry dispatched by Britain to examine causes. After \n1921 there was a period of relative calm before the next major outbreak of violence in \n1929. The flashpoint for the 1929 violence was a dispute over sovereignty of an area \ncontaining important Jewish and Muslim religious sites. Tension had been brewing \nfor some months over this issue, fermented by inflammatory rhetoric in the Arab and \nHebrew press. In late August 1929 a group of armed Arabs attacked Jewish \nworshippers in Jerusalem and in a week of rioting and violence 113 Jews and 116 \nArabs were killed. In Hebron more than sixty members of a long standing community \nof non-Zionist religious Jews were killed. In response the British set up the Shaw \nCommission of Enquiry, which concluded that the trigger for the violence was Jewish \ndemonstrations at the Wailing Wall but that the underlying causes were economic and \npolitical grievances against the Mandate. An Arab delegation including the Mufti of \nJerusalem met with British officials in London requesting a prohibition on the sale of \nlands from Arabs to non-Arabs, an end to Jewish immigration and the formation of a \nnational parliament. The Hope Simpson Commission dispatched by Britain shortly \nafterwards highlighted the problem of a growing population of landless Arabs and \nrecommended controls on Jewish immigration and land purchase. These \nrecommendations were carried through in the 1930 Passfield white paper. However, \nthese developments were regarded as a serious setback by Zionists who managed \nthrough lobbying to reverse the terms of the white paper. \nSporadic violence ignited into a full scale Arab rebellion in the years between \n1936 and 1939. Part of the revolt involved peaceful resistance, including a nationwide \nsix month strike and widespread non payment of taxes. It also involved extensive \nviolence in which Palestinians, formed into bands and destroyed crops and trees, \nmined roads and sabotaged infrastructure and oil pipelines. They attacked and killed \nJews, and also targeted Arabs who failed to offer support or who were suspected of \ncollaboration. The British historian Martin Gilbert claims that during this period 'most \nacts of Arab terror were met with, often within a few hours, by equally savage acts of \nreprisal by the Revisionists' military arm, the Irgun' (1999: 92). The Arabs demanded \ndemocratic elections and an end to immigration. The British dispatched another \n51 \ncommission of enquiry which in 1937 stated that the Mandate was unworkable and \nrecommended partition. The Peel Commission proposed that the north-west part of \nPalestine accounting for 20% of the country though containing its most fertile land \nwould become a Jewish state, the remaining 80% would become an Arab state linked \nto TransJordan. Jerusalem, Bethlehem and a corridor to the sea would remain under \nBritish control. The proposal received a mixed reception amongst Jews. One group \ncentred around Jabotinsky's revisionists argued that a Jewish State should only be set \nup in the whole of Palestine and TransJordan. Another which included Weizmann and \nDavid Ben-Gurion, argued that this was a historic opportunity to create the Jewish \nstate. The Israeli historian Simha Flapan suggests that Ben-Gurion accepted the plan \nas a stepping stone to Zionist control of all of Palestine, and points to comments he \nmade before the Zionist executive in 193 7 that: 'after the formation of a large army in \nthe wake of the establishment of the [Jewish] state, we shall abolish partition and \nexpand to the whole of the Palestine' (Ben-Gurion cited in Flapan, 1987: 22) The \nIsraeli historian and Ha'aretz columnist Tom Segev (2001) suggests for Ben-Gurion \nthe proposal (inherent in the Peel recommendations) for the 'forced transfer' of the \nArab inhabitants out of the proposed Jewish state, and the creation therefore of a \n'really Jewish' state outweighed all the drawbacks of the proposal. \nThe Arabs categorically rejected the Partition scheme arguing that all of \nPalestine was part of the Arabian homeland and it should not be broken up. The \npartition plans were never carried through and the rebellion continued until the British \nfinally quelled it. The rudimentary weapons of the Arab guerillas, were overwhelmed \nby vastly superior British military power. Hirst (1977) claims that during this period \nBritish forces took part in extensive acts of revenge and 'collective punishment'. In \nretaliation for attacks they descended on Arab villages undertook summary executions \nand destroyed possessions and dwellings. Segev (2001) claims that torture was also \nemployed by the British authorities. The rebellion had cost the lives of 10 1 Britons \nand 463 Jews (The Times, 21 July 1938, cited in Hirst, 1977: 93). Palestinian losses \nwere harder to gauge but Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi estimates upwards of \n5,000 killed and approximately 14,000 injured. (Hirst, 1977). \nThe reasons for these increasingly serious outbreak of hostility between the \ncommunities are contested. Some Israelis argue that the Zionist project was \nessentially beneficial to the Arabs of Palestine, and it was only Arab intransigence and \nxenophobia which prevented mutual accommodation. Cohn-Sherbok (2001), for \n52 \ninstance, stresses the legal basis for settlement in the Balfour Declaration which was \nincorporated into the Mandate, and points to the Arab rejection of partition in 1937. \nHe argues that Arab violence directed against the Jews was 'incomprehensible' and \nthat the Arabs were never prepared to compromise: 'Throughout this period the Arab \ncommunity was unwilling to negotiate over any of the issues facing those living in the \nHoly Land. Jews, on the other hand, continually sought to find a solution to the \nproblems confronting the native population while retaining their conviction that a \nJewish national home must be established. ' (2001: 179). Sachar (1977) argues that the \nZionist enterprise developed the country, improved the material living standards of \nthe Arab population and provided employment opportunities. The attacks on Jews, \nSachar argues were the result of incitement by xenophobic leaders such as the Mufti \nof Jerusalem and agitation by fascist infiltration from Italy and Germany. Joan Peters \n(1984) has claimed that the Zionist project was so beneficial to the Arab population \nthat large numbers were drawn in from outside Palestine. She attributes the large rise \nin the Arab population during the Mandatory period to illegal immigration from other \nArab countries and argues that because of this the Jewish population in 1948 had as \nleast as much right to the land as the Arab 'newcomers'. However a number of British \nand Israeli reviewers have denounced Peters thesis as an academic fraud, and most \ndemographers attribute the Arab population rise to decreased mortality rates, due to \nimprovements in sanitation and infrastructure. 7 Others provide different explanations \nfor the revolt. Hirst points to economic resentment generated by peasant land \nevictions and the boycott of Arab labour: \nDriven from the land the peasants flocked to the rapidly growing cities in \nsearch of work. Many of them ended up as labourers building houses for the \nimmigrants they loathed and feared. They lived in squalor. In old Haifa there \nwere I1 000 crammed into hovels built of petrol-tins, which had neither water\u0002supply or rudimentary sanitation. Other, without families, slept in the open. \nSuch conditions contrasted humiliatingly with the handsome dwellings the \npeasants were putting up for the well-to-do newcomers, or even with the \nJewish working men's quarters furnished by Jewish building societies. They \nearned half or just a quarter the wage of their Jewish counterparts and Hebrew \nLabour exclusivism was gradually depriving them of even that. (1977: 75) \n53 \nSome Israelis academics such as Gershon Shafir (1999) have characterized \ntwentieth century Zionist settlement as similar to a form of European colonialism- the \n4pure settlement colony' model which was imposed on societies in North America and \nAustralia. This model 'established an economy based on white labour which together \nwith the forced removal or the destruction of the native population allowed the settlers \nto regain the sense of cultural and ethnic homogeneity that is identified with a \nEuropean concept of nationality' (Shafir, 1999: 84). Segev argues that \n\"'disappearing\" the Arabs lay at the heart of the Zionist dream and was also a \nnecessary condition of its realization' (2001: 405). He also maintains that prominent \nZionists such as David Ben-Gurion believed that the Arab revolt was a nationalist \nstruggle designed to prevent their dispossession: \nThe rebellion cast the Arabs in a new light. Instead of a 'wild and fractured \nmob, aspiring to robbery and looting, ' Ben-Gurion said, they emerged as an \norganized and disciplined community, demonstrating its national will with \npolitical maturity and a capacity for self-evaluation. ' Were he an Arab he \nwrote, he would also rebel, with even greater intensity and with greater \nbitterness and despair. Few Zionist understood the Arab feeling, and Ben\u0002Gurion found it necessary to wam them: the rebellion was not just terror he \nsaid, he said; terror was a means to an end. Nor was it just politics, Nashashibi \nagainst the Mufti. The Arabs had launched a national war. They were battling \nthe expropriation of their homeland. While their movement may have been \nprimitive, Ben Gurion said, it did not lack devotion, idealism and self\u0002sacrifice. (2001: 370-1) \nIn the wake of the revolt the British dispatched a further commission of \nenquiry, the result of which was the 1939 MacDonald White Paper. It proposed that \n75,000 Jewish immigrants be admitted over the next five years, after which any \nfurther immigration would require Arab consent. The White Paper also proposed that \nlands sales be strictly regulated and that an independent Palestine state should come \nabout within ten years. The Zionists saw the white paper as a betrayal that seriously \nthreatened the creation of the Jewish state, especially in light of the increased \npersecution of Jews throughout Europe. The response was three pronged. One \nelement involved maintaining a flow of illegal Jewish immigration into Palestine. \n54 \nGilbert (1999) claims that many of these Jews were trying to escape persecution in \nNazi Germany, and other parts of Europe. Another which gathered pace from 1945 \nonwards, saw Zionist paramilitary groups launch attacks on the British using \nsabotage, bombings and assassinations. The third involved switching imperial \nsponsors from Britain to the United States. Zionists forged close links with American \npolitical leaders and used the Jewish vote to pressurize for policies that supported the \ncontinuation of immigration and the establishment of the Jewish state in Palestine. \nAmerican Politics and the Settlement of the Holocaust Survivors \nIn May 1942 Zionists meeting in New York, for the American Zionist \nConference issued the Biltmore Resolution demanding the creation of a 'Jewish \ncommonwealth' in mandatory Palestine and began to pressurize American political \nleaders to support its terms. In 1941 Zionists had formed the American Palestine \nCommittee. It included within its membership two thirds of the Senate, 200 members \nof the House of Representatives and the leaders of the two main political parties and \nlabour organizations (Ovendale, 1999). Unsuccessful resolutions were put before the \nHouse of Representatives and the Senate demanding free Jewish entry into Palestine \nand its reconstitution as a Jewish commonwealth. Zionist representatives also directly \nlobbied the two major political parties. The 1944 presidential election was a very \nclose contest and because of this, Ovendale (1999) suggests Zionist political leverage \nwas considerable. America's 4,500,000 Jews were concentrated in three key states \n(New York, Pennsylvania and Illinois) which could swing the election. The \nRepublican Party adopted a platform calling for unrestricted Jewish immigration into \nPalestine, no restrictions on land ownership and the conversion of Palestine into a free \nand independent Jewish commonwealth. Roosevelt was under pressure to match this \nand in a private letter to Zionist leaders promised if re-elected to seek the \n'establishment of Palestine as a free and democratic Jewish commonwealth' \n(Ovendale, 1999: 87). \nThe politics surrounding the settlement of Jewish refugees at the end of the \nSecond World War, are still highly contentious. The debate concerns whether the \nHolocaust survivors wished to settle in Palestine voluntarily, or were left with little \noption because other potential refuges such as the United States were closed to them, \nwith at least the tacit support of Zionist leaders. The debate remains emotive because \n55 \ntens of thousands of Holocaust survivors died in displaced persons camps in Europe at \nthe end of the war, whilst US congressional legislation gave priority to accepting \nrefugees from the Russian occupied states including many Nazi sympathizers and SS \ntroopers (Chomsky, 1999) At the time Zionist leaders stressed the vital importance of \nPalestine as a sanctuary for the Jewish refugees in Europe who had survived the Nazi \nHolocaust. It was argued that only Palestine could provide a haven where Jewish \nrefugees could rebuild their lives and avoid future anti-Semitism: \nThey (the Holocaust survivors) want to regain their human dignity, their \nhomeland, they want a reunion with their kin in Palestine after having lost \ntheir dearest relations. To them the countries of their birth are a graveyard of \ntheir people. They do not wish to return and they cannot. They want to go \nback to their national home, and they use Dunkirk boats. (Ben-Gurion, cited in \nGilbert, 1999: 147) \nGilbert points to attempts by Holocaust survivors aboard ships such as the \nE-xodus to reach Palestine as proof that most of the refugees were desperate to get \nthere. The Israeli historian Yehuda Bauer (1970) agues that most refugees were keen \nto settle in Palestine, citing a 1946 Hebrew investigative commission that reported \nthat 96.8 per cent of Jewish refugees languishing in European displaced person camps \nat the end of the war wanted to settle in Palestine. Avi Shlaim argues that 'few people \ndisputed the right of the Jews to a home after the trauma' of the Holocaust and that \nthe moral case for it became 'unassailable' (2000: 23-4). Other Israeli historians \nsuggest a different picture. Segev argues that: \nThere is... no basis for the frequent assertion that the state was established as a \nresult of the Holocaust. Clearly the shock, horror and sense of guilt felt by \nmany generated profound sympathy for the Jews in general and the Zionist \nmovement in particular. The sympathy helped the Zionists advance their \ndiplomatic campaign and their propaganda, and shaped their strategy to focus \neffort on the survivors, those Jews in displaced-persons camps demanding \nthey be sent to Palestine. All the survivors were Zionists, the Jewish agency \nclaimed, and they all wanted to come to Palestine. The assertion was not true. \nThe displaced were given the choice of returning to their homes in Eastern \n56 \nEurope or settling in Palestine. Few were able or willing to return to countries \nthen in the grip of various degrees of hunger, anti-Semitism or communism, \nand they were never given the option of choosing between Palestine and, say \nthe United States. In effect their options were narrowed to Palestine or the DP \ncamps (2001: 491) \nOthers such as Feingold, (1970) and Shonfeld (1977) have been very critical \nof the conduct of the Zionist movement in Palestine and America at the end of the \nSecond World War. They argue that the Zionist movement should have mobilized to \npressure the US administration to take in the Holocaust survivors, which would have \nsaved the lives of many Jews who died in displaced persons camps in Europe. Segev \nargues that the Ben-Gurion and the Labour leadership in Palestine saw the Nazi \nascension in the 1930s as potentially 'a fertile force for Zionism' because it created \nthe potential for mass Jewish immigration into Palestine (1993: 18). He alleges that \nduring the 1930s and 1940s the Labour leadership entered into haavara agreements \nwith the Nazis whereby Jews were permitted to emigrate to Palestine with limited \nquantities of capital. He claims that Ben-Gurion's political rivals in the Revisionist \nmovement opposed these agreements, and argued that rather than negotiate with \nGermany it should be boycotted. Segev also suggests that after the Kristallnacht \npogroms Ben-Gurion was concerned that the 'human conscience' might cause others \ncountries to open their doors to Jewish refugees, a move which he saw as a threat to \nZionism. \nIf I knew that it was possible to save all the children of Germany by \ntransporting them to England, but only half of them by transporting them to \nPalestine, I would choose the second - \nbecause we face not only the reckoning \nof those children, but the historical reckoning of the Jewish people (Ben\u0002Gurion, cited in Segev, 1993: 28) \nThe view that Jewish refugees were used as political leverage to create the \nJewish state in Palestine, was also shared by some prominent British and US State \nDepartment officials 8. who feared the effects on stability in Palestine and potential \nRussian penetration. 9 Roosevelt's successor, Harry Truman decided to press on with a \npolicy supporting the settlement of Jewish refugees in Palestine. Ovendale (1999) \n57 \nsuggests that this was primarily because of the 1945 New York election, in which the \nJewish vote might be decisive. The American State Department official William Eddy \nclaims that Truman had informed American ambassadors to the Arab world that 'I am \nsorry, gentlemen, but I have to answer to hundreds of thousands who are anxious for \nthe success of Zionism; I do not have hundreds of thousands of Arabs among my \nconstituents' (1954: 36). \nThe End of the Mandate \nIn Palestine Zionist paramilitary groups were gradually wearing down British \nmorale. Towards the end of the Arab revolt the Jewish community had launched \nattacks against the Arabs. In July 193 8 more than 100 Arabs were killed when six \nbombs were planted in Arab public places. The last of these, detonated in the Arab \nMelon market in Haifa, killed 53 Arabs and a Jew (Palestine Post, 26 July 1938, cited \nin Hirst, 1977: ). Towards the end of the Second World War such tactics were turned \non the British mandatory authority. Roads, bridges, trains and patrol boats were \ndestroyed. British army barracks were attacked and banks and armouries were looted. \nOn a single day in 1946 Zionist paramilitary forces launched 16 separate attacks on \nthe British army destroying many annoured vehicles and leaving 80 dead and \nwounded (Hirst 1977). Lord Moyne was assassinated by the Stem Gang, British \nofficers were captured, flogged and killed and in the most spectacular attack of all, the \ncentre of British mandatory power in Palestine the King David Hotel was destroyed \nby 500 lbs of explosives leaving 88 dead including 15 Jews. Funding for the attacks \nwas provided by sympathetic sources in the United States. The Hollywood \nscriptwriter Ben Hecht produced an article for the New York Herald Tribune entitled \n'Letter to the Terrorists of Palestine' in which he wrote 'every time you blow up a \nBritish arsenal, or wreck a British jail, or send a British railway train sky high, or rob \na British bank, or let go with your guns and bombs at the British betrayers and \ninvaders of your homeland, the Jews of America make a little holiday in their \nhearts \n... \nBrave friends we are working to help you. We are raising funds for you. ' (15 \nMay 1947, cited in Hirst, 1977: 119). The violence became so widespread that that by \nearly 1947 all non-essential British civilians and military families were evacuated \nfrom Palestine. Weakened by the Second World War, and demoralized by the \n58 \nattritional warfare, the British were unwilling to sacrifice more lives and money in \nPalestine. Gilbert (1999) suggests they were also wary of alienating Arab opinion \nbecause they were concerned to protect their oil interests in the region. In February \n1947 the British decided to end the Mandate and hand the question of Palestine to the \nUnited Nations. \nThe United Nations Debates The Future of Palestine \nThe UN dispatched a Special Committee to the region which recommended partition. \nAttention then switched to the diplomatic manoeuvring at the United Nations in New \nYork. Arab representatives, called before the UN, questioned whether the Mandate \nwas ever legal and whether the UN had the legal right to decide on the sovereignty of \nPalestine. They wished to see the issue referred to the International Court of Justice, \nand ultimately they argued it was the people of Palestine who should decide on the \nfate of the country rather than an outside body. ' 0 Zionist representatives were \nsympathetic to the partition plan being debated by member states and lobbied to \nmaximise the area that might be allotted to a Jewish State. On the 29 November 1947 \nthe Partition Plan was carried by a single vote after a last minute change of policy by \nseveral nations, with a number complaining over the political and economic pressure \nthat had been exerted on them. ' 1 Resolution 181 recommended the division of \nPalestine, with the Jewish State allotted 5,700 square miles including the fertile \ncoastal areas, whilst the Arabs State was allotted 4,300 square miles comprised mostly \nof the hilly areas. The proposed settlement would mean that each state would have a \nmajority of its own population although many Jews would fall into the Arab state and \nvice-versa. Jerusalem and Bethlehem were to become a separate area under UN \ncontrol. \nFor the Arabs the partition plan was a major blow. They believed that it was \nunfair that the Jewish immigrants, most of whom had been in Palestine less than thirty \nyears, and who owned less than 10% of the land should be given more than half of \nPalestine including the best arable land. The reaction of Zionists is disputed. Some \nhistorians such as Bregman (2003) argue that the partition resolution was seen as a \ntriumph because it allowed for the creation of a Jewish State in an area three times \nthat recommended by the Peel plan ten years earlier. Shlaim claims that the reaction \n59 \nwas more ambivalent. He suggests that it was accepted by most Zionist leaders with a \n'heavy heart' because they 'did not like the idea of an independent Palestinian state, \nthey were disappointed with the exclusion of Jerusalem, and they had grave doubts \nabout the viability of the State within the UN borders' (2000: 25). He notes that it was \ndismissed out of hand by Jewish paramilitary groups who demanded all of Palestine \nfor the Jewish state. Gilbert suggests that the Zionist leadership realised that war was \ninevitable and that Ben-Gurion 'contemplated the possibility if fighting to extend the \narea allotted to the Jews' (1999: 149). Gilbert cites orders from Ben Gurion that \nJewish forces should 'safeguard the entire Yishuv [Jewish community in Palestine] \nand settlements (wherever they may be), to conquer the whole country or most of it, \nand to maintain its occupation until the attainment of an authoritative political \nsettlement' (Ben-Gurion cited in Gilbert, 1999: 149). Hirst (1977) suggests that the \npartition plan was accepted by the Zionists because they anticipated they would \nquickly be able to militarily overwhelm the Arabs, and unilaterally expand the borders \nof the Jewish state. He points to comments made at the time by the commander of \nBritish forces in Palestine, General J. C. Darcy who stated that 'if you were to \nwithdraw British troops, the Haganah [Jewish fighting forces] would take over all \nPalestine tomorrow' and 'could hold it against the entire Arab world. ' (Crum, 1947: \n220, cited in Hirst, 1977: 134) \nThe Unofficial War \nThe UN partition plan did not solve the problems in Palestine. The Arab \nHigher Committee rejected it outright and called a three day strike. The Mufti of \nJerusalem announced aj ihad or holy war for Jerusalem. Fighting between the two \ncommunities broke out in early December 1947 and the situation quickly deteriorated \ninto a civil war. The British, unwilling and unable to restore order, announced they \nwould terminate the Mandate on May 15 1948. In the first stage of the conflict lasting \nup until Israel's declaration of Independence on May 14 1948, Jewish forces fought \nagainst Arab forces marshalled by three commanders. Fawzi el-Kawakji led the Arab \nLeague, Sir John Bagot Glubb and his 45 British officers the Transjordian Arab \nLegion, and Abdul Qader al-Husseini the Mufti's Arab forces in Jerusalem (Bregman, \n2003). In the early part of this 'unofficial war' the Arab forces won some minor \n60 \nvictories and for a time al-Husseini's forces cut the road between Jerusalem and Tel\u0002Aviv. In early April Zionist forces launched a major offensive codenamed Plan Dalet. \nAccording to Avi Shlaim the aim of Plan Dalet was 'to secure all the areas allocated \nto the Israeli state under the LN partition resolution as well as Jewish settlements \noutside these areas and corridors leading to them' (2000: 3 1). Arab towns and cities \nwere captured and their populations removed so as 'to clear the interior of the country \nof hostile and potentially hostile Arab elements' in anticipation of an attack by the \ncombined armies of the neighbouring Arab states (2000: 3 1). The operation involved \nthe application of military and psychological pressure on the Arab population, who \nwere reluctant to leave their homes. The Haganah together with paramilitary forces \nsprung surprise attacks on towns and villages launching rockets, mortars and the \nDavidka, a device which lobbed 601b of TNT 300 yards into densely populated areas \n(Hirst, 1977). Psychological pressure was also exerted by spreading rumours via \nclandestine Zionist radio stations and loudspeakers mounted on army vehicles, that \nJewish forces were planning to bum villages and kill Arabs. An Israeli reserve officer \nrecounts that: \nAn uncontrolled panic spread through the all the Arab quarters, the Israelis \nbrought up jeeps with loudspeakers which broadcast recorded 'horror sounds'. \nThese included shrieks, wails and the anguished moans of Arab women, the \nwail of sirens and the clang of fire-alarm bells, interrupted by a sepulchral \nvoice crying out in Arabic: 'Save your souls, all ye faithful: The Jews are \nusing poison gas and atomic weapons. Run for your lives in the name of Allah \n(Childers, 1976: 252, cited in Hirst, 1977: 141) \nIn April and early May 1948 a number Arab towns and cities fell before the \nZionist offensive creating many refugees. The aims of Plan Dalet remain highly \ncontested amongst historians. Some such as Ilan Pappe, Norman Finkelstein, Nur \nMasalha, Walid Khalidi and David Hirst place the operation in the context of long \nheld Zionist plans to 'transfer' the native population out of Palestine. 12 They argue \nthat the notion of transfer had been inherent in Theodore Herzl's plans for Palestine \nsome fifty years earlier (see p. 45-46) and had remained an integral element of Labor \nand Revisionist strategy. Proponents of this perspective also point to the writings of \nJoseph Weitz, who was appointed by the Jewish Agency to head 'transfer \n61 \ncommittees' which encouraged the 1948 exodus by various fonns of intimidation. In \n1940 he confided in his diary that: \nBetween ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both peoples \ntogether in this country \n... \nWe shall not achieve our goal of being an \nindependent people with the Arabs in this small country. The only solution is a \nPalestine, at least western Palestine [west of the Jordan river] without Arabs \n... \nAnd there is no other way than to transfer the Arabs from here to the \nneighbouring countries, to transfer all of them; not one village, not one tribe, \nshould be left \n... \nOnly after this transfer will the country be able to absorb the \nmillions of our own brethren. There is no other way out (Davar, 29 September \n1967, cited in Hirst 1977: 130) \nThis perspective, is contested by Israeli historians such as Benny Morris and \nAvi Shlaim who contend that the expulsions were 'born of war not design', being part \nof military expediency rather than political planning. For these historians the \nexpulsions were carried out as part of a military strategy that was spontaneous and \ninstigated on an ad hoc basis by local commanders. Morris's conclusions, have been \nsubjected to a detailed critique by Finkelstein (2000) who argues that the evidence \nthat Morris presents show the expulsions to be more systematic and pre-meditated \nthan his conclusions suggest. A third explanation, that the Palestinians left voluntarily \nin response to radio broadcasts from their leaders was propagated by some Israeli \nhistorians after the 1948 war. However although this version of events still has some \ncurrency across Israel's political spectrum (Pappe, 1999), it has become discredited \namongst many historians. 13 \nThe First Arab-Israeli War \nOn May 14 1948 as the United Nations debated a truce and trusteeship \narrangement for Palestine, and the British were evacuating their troops, David Ben\u0002Gurion declared the birth of the State of Israel in Tel-Aviv, under a portrait of \nTheodor Herzl. Eleven minutes later, despite objections from the State Department \nand US Diplomatic staff, America became the first country to recognize the new \nIsraeli state. The following day the armies of five Arab nations entered Palestine and \n62 \nengaged Israeli forces. The motives of the various Arab armies and the military \nbalance of power between Jewish and Arab forces are contested- The ex-Israeli prime \nminister Netanyahu (2000) argues that the conflict was an unequal one involving a \nsmall Jewish force pitted against a larger and better armed monolithic Arab entity \ndetermined to destroy the Jewish State at the moment of its creation. Others such as \nShlaim (2000) dispute this and argue that Jewish forces significantly outnumbered the \nArabs during all stages of the conflict, and during the final decisive phase by a ratio of \nnearly two to one. The picture of a monolithic Arab force determined to destroy Israel \nis also disputed. Flapan (1987) suggests that the primary objective of King Abdullah \nof TransJordan, (who had nominal control of all the Arab forces) was not to prevent \nthe emergence of a Jewish State but to take control of the Arab part of Palestine, as \npart of a secret pact that he had made with Golda Meir in November 1947. Ovendale \n(1999) further suggests that the other Arab States involved were riven by competing \nterritorial and political ambitions, in contrast to the Jewish forces who mostly fought \nwith a united front. \nIn the first stage of fighting leading up to the truce on June II Israeli forces \nconsolidated their hold on a number of mixed Arab-Jewish towns, the Eastern and \nwestern Galilee and parts of the Negev. Jerusalem saw fierce fighting between Israeli \nand TransJordanian forces. During the first truce the Israelis took the opportunity to \nrecruit more fighters and substantially re-arm. The U. N. appointed a mediator, the \nSwedish Count Bernadotte, who put forward a proposal for ending the conflict. It \nsuggested a union between an Arab state linked to TransJordan and a Jewish state. \nJerusalem would be part of the Arab state. The proposal was rejected by all sides. The \nArabs rejected plans to prolong the truce and on July 9 battle recommenced. In nine \ndays of fighting leading up to a second truce the Israelis took the initiative capturing \nthe Arab towns of Nazareth, Lydda and Ramleh. During this second truce Israel \nmobilized and trained more fighters, many of whom were newly arrived immigrants, \nand arranged the shipment of more weapons. They also consolidated their hold on the \noccupied territories and according to Bregman razed 'Arab villages to the ground so \nthat their previous inhabitants who took what they believed to be a temporary refuge \nelsewhere would have nowhere to return to. ' (2003: 57). During the second truce \nCount Bernadotte put forward another proposal for settling the conflict. Territorially it \nwas similar to his previous proposal, although Jerusalem would fall under United \nNations control, and the Palestinians would decide their own political fate in \n63 \nconsultation with other Arabs states. The proposal was due to be debated by the \nUnited Nations General Assembly on 21 September, but on 17 September Count \nBernadotte was assassinated in Jerusalem, by members of the Stem gang under orders \nfrom a triumvirate that included Yitzak Shamir, who later became Prime Minister of \nIsrael (Bregman, 2003). During this second truce Ben-Gurion proposed to the Israeli \ncabinet launching a major offensive to capture much of the West Bank, but failed to \ngain majority approval and switched his attention to a plan to push Egyptian forces \nback across the Negev into Egypt. At this time Shlaim (1999) claims that Israel \nreceived a peace proposal from the Egyptian government offering de facto recognition \nof Israel in exchange for Egypt's annexation of a portion of land in the Negev. He \nargues that Ben-Gurion ignored Egypt's proposals, and persuaded the cabinet to \nauthorize a series of military offensives designed to capture the Negev. These were \nhighly successful with the Israeli army driving the Egyptians out of the Negev and \nfollowing it into Egypt proper. Eventually Britain intervened on the Egyptian side \nunder the terms of the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, and after forceful pressure from \nPresident Truman Ben-Gurion agreed to withdraw his troops from the Sinai and \naccept a new truce. \nPost-War Nepotiations: Peace Treaties, Borders and Refugees \nThe war ended on January 7 1949. It had extracted a high price on all parties. Israel \nhad lost more than 6,000 lives or one percent of its population. It had however made \nhuge territorial gains. UN resolution 181 had recommended the Jewish state be \nestablished in 57% of mandatory Palestine. By the end of 1948 the Israeli state had \ncontrol of 78%. \nAfter the war the Israelis engaged in immediate nation building. Elections \nwere held in January 1949 based on a system of proportional party lists. The Mapai \nparty won the most seats with its leader Ben-Gurion becoming the nation's first Prime \nMinister, whilst Chaim Weizmann was installed as President. The Palestinian view \nthe events of 1948 as so traumatic they are simply known as Al Nakba or 'The \nCatastrophe'. The refugees created prior to the start of the 'official war' on May 15 \nswelled during the conflict. The Israeli historian Illan Pappe, claims that towards the \nend of the war 'several massacres were committed adding an incentive to the flight of \n64 \nthe population' and in the final stages of the conflict 'expulsion was even more \nsystematic' (1999: 51-2). The war ended with 520,000 Palestinian refugees according \nto Israel, 726,000 as estimated by the UN, and 810,000 as estimated by the British \ngovernment (Gilbert, 1999). The 150,000 Palestinians who were left in the new Israeli \nstate, were according to Bregman regarded by Israel as a 'dangerous and not-to-be\u0002trusted potential fifth column' and were therefore placed under military rule: \nThe military government operated in areas where Arabs were concentrated and \nits main task was to exercise governmental Policies in these areas. It was a \nmost powerful body hated by the Arabs, for it effectively controlled all \nspheres of their lives imposing on them severe restrictions: it banned the Arabs \nfrom leaving their villages and travel to other parts of the country without \nobtaining special permission; it detained suspects without trial and it also, \nfrequently, in the name of security, closed whole areas, thus preventing Arab \npeasants access to their fields and plantations which was devastating for them \nfor they were dependant on their crops for their livelihood. The military \ngovenunent also imposed curfews on whole villages and on one occasion, \nwhen the village of Kfar Qassem, unaware of the curfew, returned to their \nhomes, the Israelis opened fire killing 47. (2003: 74) \nDuring 1949 Israel, under the auspices of the UN negotiated separate armistice \nagreements with all Arab States involved in the conflict. Jordan moved to annex the \nWest Bank whilst Egypt moved to occupy the Gaza Strip but unlike Jordan it made no \neffort to annex the territory. The name Palestine had disappeared from the map, its \nterritory having been absorbed into the Israeli and Jordanian States. In late April \n1949 Israel met with delegations from Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and the Arab \nHigher Committee in Lausanne to try and hammer out a peace deal. The two central \nsticking points were borders and refugees. The Arab delegation wanted to see borders \nbased on the 1947 UN partition resolution, that they had previously rejected. The \nIsraelis argued the permanent borders should be based on the ceasefire lines with only \nminor modifications. No agreement was reached. On December 11 1948 the United \nNations General Assembly had passed Resolution 194 which resolved 'that the \nrefugees wishing to return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbours \nshould be pen-nitted to do so at the earliest practicable date, and that compensation \n65 \nshould be paid for the property of those choosing not to return and for loss of or \ndamage to property' This position on the repatriation of refugees Pappe (1999) \nargues, was shared by the UN, Europe and the US. Israel rejected the return of \nrefugees and the payment of compensation, arguing that the Arab states had created \nthe refugee problem by attacking Israel and they should therefore settle the refugees \nin their own countries: \n'We did not want the war. Tel Aviv did not attack Jaffa. It was Jaffa which \nattacked Tel Aviv and this will not occur again. Jaffa will be a Jewish town. \nThe repatriation of the Arabs is not justice, but folly. Those who declared war \nagainst us will have to bear the result after they have been defeated. ' (David \nBen-Gurion cited in Gabbay, 1959: 109) \nFrom June 1949 onwards Pappe argues that Israeli leaders were committed to \nc creating a fait accompli that would render repatriation impossible' (1999: 5 2). In that \nmonth Joseph Weitz wrote in a memorandum that there was a consensus among \nIsraeli leaders that the best way to deal with the abandoned Palestinian villages was \nby 'destruction, renovation and settlement by Jews' (Weitz cited in Pappe, 1999: 52). \nThis plan which Pappe claims Israel carried out 'to the letter' required the State 'to \ndemolish what was left of abandoned Palestinian villages, almost 350 in all, so that \nthe term repatriation itself, would become meaningless' (1999: 52). Pappe suggests \nthat for Israelis the subject of the Palestinian refugees raises difficult questions about \nthe nature of the Israeli State: \nIsraelis \n- \nleaders and people alike - \nhave a genuine psychological problem when \nfaced with the refugee issue. This is indeed for them the 'original sin'. It puts a \nhuge question mark over the Israeli self-image of moral superiority and human \nsensitivity. It ridicules Israel's oxymorons, such as the 'purity of arms' or \nmisnomers, such as the 'Israeli Defence Forces', and raises doubts over the \nreligious notion of the 'chosen people' and the political pretension of being the \nonly democracy in the Middle East which should be wholeheartedly supported \nby the West. In the past it has produced a series of repressions and self denials \nas well as the promotion of unrealistic political solutions \n... \nIt was accompanied \n66 \nby an intellectual struggle against the Palestinians, epitomised by the official \nIsraeli fabrication of the history of the land and the conflict (1999: 5 8) \nAlthough the Armistice agreements had ended the military conflict, there \nwere no formal peace treaties signed between Israel and its Arab neighbours, setting \nthe scene for further sporadic clashes. This failure to negotiate comprehensive peace \ntreaties is a contentious issue. Sachar for instance, blames Arab intransigence, \nclaiming that Israel repeatedly attempted to make peace but its efforts were rebuffed \nby Arab States: '[The] Arab purpose was single minded and all-absorptive. It was \nflatly committed to the destruction of Israel as an independent state' (1977: 43 0) \nSome historians claim the opposite. Shlaim argues that 'the files of the Israeli Foreign \nMinistry \n... \nburst at the seams with evidence of Arab peace feelers and Arab readiness \nto negotiate with Israel from September 1948 on' (2000: 49). \nIn the years after 1948 the Arab world instituted an economic boycott against \nIsrael, shut its borders and refused its aircraft permission to use their airspace. This \nperiod also saw a radical demographic shift in the Jewish population throughout the \nMiddle East. In the nine years following the 1948 war 567,000 Jews left Muslim \ncountries and most settled in Israel, so that the population swelled from 1,174,000 in \n1949 to 1 \n. \n873,000 in 1956 (Ovendale, 1999). Sachar (1977) claims that in many of \nthese societies, particularly Iraq and Egypt the Jewish population had 'prospered \nmightily', but argues that in the 1940s they were subject to increasing levels of \nharassment and persecution. He claims that in Libya anti-Jewish riots in 1945 had left \nseveral hundred dead or wounded, and in Syria the Jewish population saw its property \nand employment rights curtailed. Gilbert (1999) maintains that Israeli officials were \ninstrumental in facilitating these population transfers from Muslim countries, known \nin Israel as 'the ingathering of the exiles', because there was a shortage of manpower \nin Israel after 1948. It has been claimed that the methods employed were \ncontroversial. Gilbert (1999) and Hirst (1977) write that in Iraq, Jewish agents planted \nbombs in synagogues and Jewish businesses in an attempt to stimulate immigration to \nIsrael. \nDespite the stabilization of the political and military situation following the \n1948 war clashes along the armistice lines were a constant source of friction between \nIsrael and its Arab neighbours. Displaced Palestinians in Arab states began to engage \nin what was known as 'infiltration'. Shlaim alleges that '90 per cent or more of all \n67 \ninfiltrations were motivated by social and economic concerns' involving persons \ncrossing the ceasefire lines to retrieve property, see relatives or tend their land' (2000: \n82). Many of refugees had been separated from their homes and land and so had no \nemployment and went hungry. The other ten percent involved acts of sabotage and \nviolence directed against Israelis. Shlaim claims that the Israelis adopted a 'free fire' \npolicy towards infiltrators which encouraged the Arabs to organise into groups and \nrespond in kind. The British Major John Glubb argued that 'the original infiltrator \nwere han-nless and unarmed seeking lost property or relatives. Yet Jewish terrorism \n[i. e. shoot to kill and reprisals raids] made the infiltrator into a gunman (cited in \nMorris, 1997: 5 1). Between the end of the 1948 war and the 1956 Suez war, the \nIsraeli authorities estimated that 294 civilians had been killed by infiltrators from \nJordan, Lebanon and Egypt (Morris, 1997: 97-8). Shlaim claims that in this period \nbetween 2,700 and 5,000 infiltrators were killed by 'trigger happy' Israeli soldiers \n'the great majority of them unarmed' (2000: 82). Some Israeli historians argue that \nArab leaders encouraged infiltration as an attempt to weaken and destroy the Israeli \nState. In contrast Shlaim claims that 'there is strong evidence from Arab, British, \nAmerican, UN and even Israeli sources to suggest that for the first six years after the \nwar, the Arab governments were opposed to infiltration and tried to curb it'. (2000: \n84). Israel adopted a policy of reprisals directed against villages in Gaza and Jordan \n. \nShlaim claims that 'all of these raids were aimed at civilian targets' and 'greatly \ninflamed Arab hatred of Israel and met with mounting criticism from the international \ncommunity' (2000: 83). A specialist reprisal brigade, unit 101 was created, under the \ncommand of Ariel Sharon. It first major operation involved an attack on the village of \nQuibya in 1953, following the killing of an Israeli mother and two children by a hand \ngrenade in Yahuda. Unit 10 1 reduced Quibya 'to a pile of rubble: forty five houses \nhad been blown up and sixty-nine civilians, two-thirds of them women and children' \nwere killed (2000: 9 1). A UN report found that 'the inhabitants had been forced by \nheavy fire to stay inside, until their homes were blown up over them. ' (2000: 9 1) \nShlaim also claims that such acts were also carried out against Arab villages within \nthe State of Israel: \nPeriodic search operations were also mounted in Arab villages inside Israel to \nweed out infiltrators. From time to time the soldiers who carried out these \noperations committed atrocities, among them gang rape, murder and on one \n68 \noccasion, the dumping of 120 infiltrators in the Arava desert without water. The \natrocities were committed not in the heat of battle but for the most part against \ninnocent civilians, including women and children. Coping with day to day \nsecurity had a brutalising effect on the IDF. Soldiers in an army which prided \nitself on the precept of \"the purity of arms\" showed growing disregard for \nhuman lives and carried out some barbaric acts that can only be described as \nwar crimes. (2000: 83) \nIt was against this backdrop of border tensions that Israel became involved in \na broader struggle between Britain, France and Egypt over control of the Suez Canal. \n1956: The Suez Conflict \nIn Egypt following a bloodless coup in 1952, Gamal Abd al-Nassar and his 'free \nofficers' took power and turned the state into a Republic. In 1954 Nasser became \nPresident and began a leftist programme of poverty reduction and agrarian reform. He \nalso attempted to make himself the champion of a pan-Arabic renaissance, and the \nleader of the de-cololonisation movement across the Middle East and Africa. \nOvendale (1999) suggests that the European colonial powers feared the effects of \nNasser's Arab nationalism on their oil interests and geo-strategic control of the \nMiddle East and Africa. France was also hostile because his support for Algerians \nfighting for independence. In July 1956 Nasser nationalised the Suez Canal after the \nUS and Britain refused to fund the Aswan Dam Project, which Nasser saw as a means \nto develop Egypt as a modem nation. Britain and France who were shareholders in the \nCanal decided Nasser had to be removed from power. Israel also wanted to see Nasser \ndeposed and on 23 October 1956 British, French and Israeli representatives met in \nParis to devise a military plan (Shlaim, 2000). \nOn 29 October 1956 the IDF launched an attack on Egyptian force in the \nSinai peninsula. The next day Britain and France issued an ultimatum to Egypt and \nIsrael to withdraw their force to a distance of ten miles from the Suez Canal. Israel \ncomplied, Egypt reftised and the following day Britain and France began an aerial \nbombardment of the Egyptian airfields. Israel quickly secured an overwhelming \nmilitary victory capturing Gaza on the 2 November and the whole Sinai peninsula \n69 \nthree days later. On November 7 Ben-Gurion delivered a speech to the Knesset where \n'he hinted that Israel planned to annex the entire Sinai peninsula as well as the Straits \nof Tiran' (Shlaim 2000: 179). However under strong pressure from the USA and \nUSSR and threats of United Nations sanctions Israel was eventually forced to \nwithdraw from all of the Sinai after six months. Some aspects of the war remain \ncontroversial. A report in Israeli daily Ma'ariv claimed that during the war, 273 \nEgyptian prisoners of war had been killed by Israel's 890 Paratrooper Battalion \ncommanded by Rafael Eitian, who was one of the architects of Israel's 1982 invasion \nof Lebanon (8 August 1995). Israel's motivations have been the subject of much \ncontroversy. One version maintains that Israel was driven to attack Egypt for three \nmain reasons. Firstly it is argued the Egyptian leader Nasser was planning to lead a \ncombined Arab force (Egypt, Jordan, Syria) in an attempt to destroy Israel, and the \nSuez conflict was necessary as a pre-emptive military strike to prevent this. Sachar \n(1977) points to belligerent speeches made by Arab leaders in the months preceding \nthe war, which he argues were proof of imminent Arab plans to destroy Israel. He also \nsuggests that Egypt's acquisition of large shipment of arms from Czechoslovakia in \n1955 had shifted the balance of power against Israel. Sachar also claims that Israel \nwanted to break Egypt's blockade of the Suez Canal, and stop Palestinian guerrilla \nattacks on Israel. This perspective on Israeli motivations sees the attack on Egypt as \ndefensive in orientation and concerned only with strengthening the country's security \nsituation. \nOther historians have pointed to other reasons for the attack. Shlaim (2000) \nargues that Israel's military establishment led by Ben-Gurion and Moeshe Dayan \nwere determined to goad Nasser into a war by carrying out provocative raids against \nEgyptian forces, despite Egyptian attempts to curb infiltration. The most serious of \nthese raids occurred in February 1955 when an Israeli unit led by Ariel Sharon \nattacked the Egyptian army headquarters on the outskirts of Gaza killing 37 Egyptian \nsoldiers. Hirst claims that Egypt had consistently tried to avoid military confrontation \nwith Israel, and had only 'unleashed thefedayeen [Palestinian guerrillas] under \npressure from his own public opinion in the wake of further provocations from Israel' \n(1977: 200). Both Hirst (1977) and Shlaim argue that there was no credible evidence \nthat Nasser was planning a war with Israel, nor that that the balance of power had \nshifted in Egypt favour. They suggest that the war was undertaken to expand the \nborders of Israel and overthrow Nasser's regime. Shlaim maintains that Israel hoped \n70 \nto absorb the whole of the Sinai peninsula, the West Bank and part of the Lebanon. \nHe argues that Ben-Gurion 'exposed an appetite for territorial expansion at the \nexpense of the Arabs and expansion in every possible direction: north, east and south' \nas well as 'a cavalier attitude to toward the independence, sovereignty and territorial \nintegrity of the neighbouring Arab states' (2000: 178) \n1967: The Six-Dav War \nDuring the 1960s the Middle East became a site of cold war rivalry between America \nand the Soviet Union, both of whom were supplying the region's states with weapons. \nIn spring 1967 the Soviet Union misinformed the Syrian government that Israel was \nmassing troops on its northern border in preparation for an attack on Syria. No such \ntroop movements had actually taken place. However the previous year had seen a \nnumber of border clashes between the two nations and tensions had been running \nhigh. Israel had threatened publicly to overthrow the Syrian regime unless it stopped \nPalestinian guerrilla attacks launched from Syrian territory. Syria alarmed by the \nSoviet reports, turned to Egypt with whom it had a mutual defence pact. Egypt then \nsent a number of troops into the Sinai, bordering Israel and asked the United Nations \ntroops who formed a buffer between the two countries to evacuate their positions. The \nEgyptians troops then moved into Sharm al-Shaykh and proclaimed a blockade of the \nIsraeli port of Eliat, which was accessible only through Egyptian waters. Two weeks \nlater at 7: 45 a. m. on 5 June 1967 Israel launched an aerial attack on Egyptian airfields \ndestroying 298 warplanes, the bulk of the Egyptian airforce, in a single day. Israeli \nground forces also launched an almost simultaneous land invasion of Egyptian \nterritory, forcing their way to the Suez Canal and capturing the Sinai peninsula in two \ndays. At noon on 5 June, as part of a defence pact with Egypt, Syrian, Jordanian and \nIraqi forces attacked targets inside Israel. Within two hours the air forces of all three \nwere destroyed by the Israeli airforce, as well as an Iraqi military base near the \nJordanian border. Jordanian land forces also intervened in support of Egypt. Jordanian \nartillery shelled Israeli towns and its troops entered Arab East Jerusalem and occupied \nGovernment House. Israel then drove the Jordanian army out of the West Bank and \nEast Jerusalem, occupying them both by 7 June. The following day Israeli warplanes \nattacked the American spy ship, the USS Liberty, with cannon, missiles and napalm, \n71 \nkilling 34 US service personnel and injuring 171.14 On 9 June Israel attacked Syria, \ndespite strong UN pressure, and occupied the Golan Heights. There have been \nallegations in the Israeli press that about a thousand unresisting Egyptian soldiers, as \nwell as many Palestinian refugees were killed by the Israeli army (Ha'aretz, 17 \nAugust 1995). The war was an overwhelming military success for Israel. In six days it \ndestroyed three Arab armies and made large territorial gains, capturing the Sinai \nPeninsula, the Golan Heights, the West Bank, Gaza Strip and Arab East Jerusalem. \nThe reasons behind Israel's decision to launch the six day war are disputed. \nThe official Israeli cabinet documents stated that the 'Government [of Israel] \nascertained that the armies of Egypt, Syria and Jordan are deployed for immediate \nmulti-front aggression, threatening the very existence of the state' (cited in \nFinkelstein, 1995: 130). Sachar points to Nasser's decision to replace United Nations \npeacekeeping troops in the Sinai with Egyptian troops, and military preparations by \nother Arab nations as evidence that 'the garrot \n... \nwas rapidly tightening around Israel' \n(1977: 632). He also points to Israeli motivations to stop Syrian shelling of Israeli \nsettlements in the DMZ (demilitarised zone) between Israel and Syria, and guerrilla \nraids into Israeli territory. Another justification given for Israel's attack was that \nEgypt's decision to blockade of the Straits of Tiran which prevented access to the \nIsraeli port of Eliat, was according to the Israeli Foreign Minister Abba Eban, an \n'attempt at strangulation' which constituted an 'act of war' (Eban, 1992 :334, cited in \nFinkelstein, 1995: 137). \nSome other historians have questioned these explanations and pointed to an \nalternative set of motivations. The twin assertions that the Arab states were planning \nan imminent attack and that they had the military strength to threaten Israel's \nexistence are disputed. Finkelstein claims that an 'exhaustive US intelligence at the \nend of the month [May 1967] could find no evidence that Egypt was planning to \nattack' (1999: 134). Menachem Begin and Yitzak Rabin later argued that the Arab \nstates had not been planning an attack and that the Israeli government had been well \naware of this at the time. 15 The claim that the combined Arab armies posed a mortal \nthreat to the state of Israel is also disputed. The CIA produced a report in May 1967 \npredicting (British intelligence had reached the identical conclusion), that Israel \nwould win a war against one or all of the Arab states combined, whoever attacked \nfirst, in about a week (Finkelstein, 1999). Menachem Begin and Ezer Weizmann have \nalso argued that Israel's existence was never threatened. 16 Five years after the war, in \n72 \nan Israeli newspaper article, one of the chief military planners of the campaign \nGeneral Matitiahu Peled, was dismissive of the Arab threat in 1967: \nThere is no reason to hide the fact that since 1949 no one dared, or more \nprecisely, no one was able to threaten the very existence of Israel. In spite of \nthat, we have continued to foster a sense of our own inferiority, as if we were a \nweak and insignificant people, which, in the midst of an anguished struggle for \nits existence, could be exterminated at any moment \n... \nit is notorious that the \nArab leaders themselves, thoroughly aware of their own impotence, did not \nbelieve in their own threats \n... \nI am sure that our General Staff never told the \ngovernment that the Egyptian military threat represented any threat to Israel or \nthat we were unable to crush Nasser's army, which with unheard of \nfoolishness, had exposed itself to the devastating might of our army \n... \nTo \nclaim that the Egyptian forces concentrated on our borders were capable of \nthreatening Israel's existence not only insults the intelligence of anyone \ncapable of analysing this kind of situation, but is an insult to the Zahal [the \nIsraeli army] (Maariv, 24 March 1972, cited in Hirst, 1977: 211) \nOther posited explanations for Israel's decision to attack it Arab neighbours \ninclude a desire to safeguard the deterrent image of the IDF. Shlaim (2000) suggests \nthat the Egyptian blockade represented a threat to Israel's 'iron wall' of militarised \nstrength. Others suggest different motivations. Neff claims that on the eve of the 1967 \nWar the CIA had identified three Israeli objectives: 'the destruction of the centre of \npower of the radical Arab socialist movements' [i. e. Nasser's regime], 'the destruction \nof the arms of the radical Arabs', and the 'destruction of both Jordan and Syria as \nmodem States' (Neff, 1984: 230, cited in Finkelstein, 1999: 143). Hirst (1977) argues \nthat Israeli military planners had been preparing the attack since they were forced to \nleave the Sinai in 1956, and cites comments from General Bums, the chief of staff of \nUNTSO in the early 1960s that Israel would probably seek to go to war again soon to \nbreak the Arab economic blockade and overcome its economic difficulties. Another \nexplanation that has been cited as a motivation for Israel's decision to go to war \ninvolved a desire to expand the boundaries of Israel. Proponents of this view, point to \ncomments made by the Israeli commander Yigal Allon shortly before the 1967 war \nthat 'in the case of a new war' Israel must seek as a central aim 'the territorial \n73 \nfulfilment of the land of Israel. ' (cited in Finkelstein, 1999: 143). There is evidence \nsince the 1950s in the writings of David Ben-Gurion and other Israeli leaders that \nthere had been a desire to expand Israel to incorporate all of Jerusalem and the West \nBank. The Israeli historian Benny Morris notes: \nA strong expansionist current ran through both Zionist ideology and Israeli \nsociety. There was a general feeling shared by prominent figures as Dayan and \nBen-Gurion, that the territorial gains of the 1948 war had fallen short of the \nenvisioned promised land. Bechiya Le Dorot- literally a cause for lamentation for \nfuture generations- was how Ben-Gurion described the failure to conquer Arab \nEast Jerusalem; leading groups in Israeli society regarded the Jordanian \ncontrolled West Bank with the same feeling. (Morris, 1989: 410-411, cited in \nFinkelstein, 1999: 221) \nThe conflict triggered a second mass exodus of Palestinians, many of whom \nbecame refugees for a second time, as they had sought refuge in the West Bank and \nGaza after having to abandon their homes in 1948-9. Nur Masalha, senior lecturer at \nthe Holy Land Research Project at the University of Surrey, argues that 'there is no \nevidence to suggest that there were wholesale or blanket expulsion orders adopted or \ncarried out by the Israeli army in June 1967, although the policy of selective eviction, \ndemolition and encouragement of 'transfer' continued for several weeks after the \nIsraeli army occupied the West Bank and Gaza Strip. ' (Masalha, 1999: 100). Masalha \nmaintains that in 1967 'evictions and demolitions were evident in numerous \ngeographical locations in the West Bank' and that 'young men from several cities and \nrefugee camps were also targeted for deportation' (1999: 10 1). Peter Dodd and Halim \nBarakat in their study of the 1967 exodus, River without Bridges provide similar \nexplanations for the exodus: \nThe exodus was a response to the severe situational pressures existing at the \ntime. The situational pressures were generated by the aerial attacks upon a \ndefenceless country, including the extensive use of napalm, the occupation of \nthe West Bank villages by the Israeli army, and the actions of the occupying \nforces. Certainly the most dramatic of these was the eviction of civilians, and \nthe deliberate destruction of a number of villages [Imwas, Yalu, Bayt Nuba, \n74 \nBayt Marsam, Bayt Awa, Habla, al-Buý and Jiftlik]. Other action, such as \nthreats and the mass detention of male civilians, also created situational \npressures (Dodd & Barakat, 1969: 54 cited in Masalha, 1999: 96) \nWilliam Wilson Harris (1980), who reached similar conclusions himself in his \nanalysis of the exodus, estimates that 250,000 residents of the West Bank, 70,000 \nresidents of the Gaza strip and 90,000 residents of the Golan Heights were forced to \nflee their homes during 1967. The displaced residents of the West Bank were \nprevented from returning to the area by harsh measures. Testimony in the Israeli \npress, from a unnamed soldier serving in the 5 th Reserve Division on the Jordan River, \ndetails the fate of displaced Palestinians attempting to return to their homes: \nWe fired such shots every night on men, women and children. Even during \nmoonlit nights when we could identify the people, that is distinguish between \nmen, women and children. In the mornings we searched the area and, by \nexplicit order from the officer on the spot, shot the living, including those who \nhid or were wounded, again including the women and children\" (Haolam Haze \n10 October 1967 cited in Masalha, 1999: 99) \nThere were reports that after the war Israel began destroying Palestinian \nhomes in the newly occupied territories. The American historian Alfred Lilienthal \nclaims that 'according to UN figures, the Israelis destroyed during the period between \nII June 1967 and 15 November 1969 some 7,554 Palestinian Arab homes in the \nterritories seized during that war; this figure excluded 35 villages in the occupied \nGolan Heights that were razed to the ground. In the two years between September \n1969 and 1971 the figure was estimated to have reached 16,312 homes. ' (1978: 160) \nOn 19 June 1967 Israeli leaders formulated an offer to hand back the Golan \nHeights, the Sinai and the Gaza Strip in return for demilitarisation agreements, peace \ntreaties and assurance of navigation rights from Egypt, Syria and Jordan. Bergman \n(2003) suggests that the decision, taken two months later, by Arab leaders meeting in \nKhartoum to issue the famous 'three noes' to peace, recognition and negotiations with \nIsrael led to the Israeli decision taken on October 30 to officially withdraw the offer, \nand harden its attitude. Shlaim (2000) disagrees arguing that there was no evidence \nthat the conditional offer of withdrawal was ever presented to the Arab states, and that \n75 \nthe offer was almost immediately killed by political and military leaders who wanted \nto retain a large part of the captured territories, and began in mid-July to approve \nplans for constructing settlements on the occupied Golan Heights. He maintains that \nthe 'three noes' at Khartoum referred to 'no formal peace treaty, but not a rejection of \na state of peace; no direct negotiations, but not a refusal to talk through third parties; \nand no dejure recognition of Israel, but acceptance of its existence as a state' (2000: \n258). He argues the conference was 'a victory for Arab moderates who argued for \ntrying to obtain the withdrawal of Israeli forces by political rather than military \nmeans' (2000: 258). There have also been claims that Israel turned down a peace \ntreaty with Egypt and Jordan at the conference. 17 \nShlaim claims that there was no Israeli debate about handing back East \nJerusalem, but that Israeli leaders were split on how much of the West Bank they \nwanted to retain. He suggests outright annexation was favoured by only a few, \nbecause it would mean absorbing large numbers of Arabs into the Jewish state. Most \nfavoured one of two options. The 'Allon Plan' proposed limited autonomy for \nPalestinians in part the West Bank (Israel would still own the land and control \nsecurity in the autonomy area), with Israel taking control of a large strip of the Jordan \nValley, much of the area around Jerusalem and the Judean desert. These parts of the \nWest Bank would then be colonised with Jewish settlements and army bases. The \nsecond option involved handing back to Jordan part of the West Bank with Israel \nkeeping approximately a third of the area. Neither proposal was acceptable to King \nHussein or the Palestinians. \nResolution 242 and the War of Attrition \nThe 1967 war was followed by UN Security Council unanimously adopting resolution \n242, which has become the framework document for successive attempts to resolve \nthe conflict. The resolution called for the 'withdrawal of Israeli an-ned forces from \nterritories occupied in the recent conflict' in line with the principle 'emphasise[d]' in \nthe preambular paragraph of the 'inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by \nwar'. It also 'emphasised' the 'need to work for a just and lasting peace in which \nevery State in the area can live in security' as well as a 'just settlement of the refugee \nproblem' and the establishment of navigation rights. Egypt and Jordan agreed to \n76 \nresolution 242 whilst Syria rejected it. The Palestinians also rejected it on the grounds \nthat it only spoke of their plight as a refugee problem, making no mention of their \nrights to self-determination and national sovereignty. Israel accepted the resolution in \n1970. The meaning of the withdrawal clause has been contested. Israel has argued that \nbecause the definite article 'the' was not included in the English version of the \nresolution ffrorn territories occupied' rather than 'from the territories occupied') it \nmeans that the scope of withdrawal was left vague and that Israel did not have to \nwithdraw from all the territories it occupied in the conflict. Israel has also argued that \nmany of the nations who endorsed the resolution including the United States, United \nKingdom, USSR and Brazil agreed that Israel did not have to withdraw from all the \nterritories (Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 1999). Finkelstein (2001) disputes this. \nHe points to statements made by the United Nations General Assembly President that \n'there is virtual unanimity in upholding the principle that conquest of territory by war \nis inadmissible in our time under the Charter' (U. N. General Assembly 1967a, cited in \nFinkelstein, 2001: 145). This affirmation, the President continued was 'made in \nvirtually all statements' and that 'virtually all speakers laid down the corollary that \nwithdrawal of forces to their original position is expected. ' (U. N. General Assembly \n1967a, cited in Finkelstein, 2001: 145). The debates at the UN Security Council, \nFinkelstein argues, were similarly unambiguous with virtually all representatives \nstressing both the inadmissibility clause and the need for a complete Israeli \nwithdrawal. 18He also argues that the American position was for a full Israeli \nwithdrawal. 19 \nHaving failed to secure an Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories \nEgypt fought the 'war of attrition' against Israel between 1967 and 1970. Shlaim \nargues President Nasser's immediate purpose was to 'prevent the conversion of the \nSuez Canal into a de facto border, while his ultimate goal was to force Israel to \nwithdraw to the prewar border' (2000: 289). Egypt bombed Israeli troop \nconcentrations in the occupied Sinai and Palestinian guerrillas launched cross border \nattacks against Israel. Israel then attacked military and civilian targets within Egypt \nand Jordan. Numerous Egyptian coastal towns and cities were heavily damaged by \nIsraeli air attacks. The Israeli commander Ezer Weizman recalled the fate of an \nEgyptian border city Ismailia which the Israeli army bombarded 'incessantly, \ndevastating it from the air as well as with land-based artillery' so that aerial \nphotographs 'showed its western portions resembling the cities at the end of World \n77 \nWar 11' (Weizman cited in Gilbert, 1999: 410). Moeshe Dayan was later to claim that \nIsraeli attacks during the war of attrition had created one and a half million Egyptian \nrefugees as well as emptying the entire Jordan Valley of its inhabitants (Al Hamishar, \n10 May 1978). The war was finally brought to a halt in August 1970 when both sides \nagreed to a US sponsored ceasefire. Morris (1992) estimates that in the three years of \nconflict, 367 Israeli soldiers and more than 10,000 Egyptian soldiers and civilians \nwere killed. \nSettlement Building, Economic Integration and the Occupation \nIn the aftermath of the 1967 war Israel established settlements on the newly captured \nterritories and placed the Palestinian residents under military rule. Two major reasons \nwere given for the creation of settlements. One stressed their security value: \nThere was also a strategic justification for not wanting to give up the occupied \nWest Bank and that was that it turned Israel's 'narrow waist' into something \nwider. Before seizing the West Bank Israel's width at some parts measured \nscarcely nine miles from the Jordan bulge to the Mediterranean, and by \nclinging to the occupied territories west of the Jordan river Israel made it more \ndifficult for a potential Arab invasion force coming from the east to cut in two. \n(Bregman, 2003: 126-7) \nSome Israelis were dismissive of the security argument alleging it was a \npretext to satisfy international public opinion. One official writing in the Israeli press \nclaimed that 'we have to use the pretext of security needs and the authority of the \nmilitary governor as there is no way of driving out the Arabs from their land so long \nas they refuse to go and accept our compensation' (Haaretz, 23 November 1969, \ncited in Hirst, 1977: 24 1). A second strand of thought justified settlement building and \nretention of the occupied territories, on the basis of divine rights. Victory in the six \nday war was seen by many religious Jews as a sign of support from God and evidence \nthat the messianic era was at hand, leading to a surge in support for religious \nnationalism. A number of new parties and organisations were formed who advocated \npermanent control and settlement of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, because, it was \n78 \nargued, these areas were a central component of the biblical land of Israel. Harold \nFisch, the former rector of Israel's Bar-Ilan University, argues that God promised \nAbraham the land of Israel as an eternal possession, and this provides justification for \nsovereignty over the West Bank and Gaza Strip: \nThe covenant between the people of Israel and its God, which includes the \npromised land as an integral part, is an important objective within the entire \nscheme of creation. It is from this fact that the linkage between the people of \nIsrael and its land is rooted-in the transcendental will of God who created all in \nhis honor (Fisch, 1982: 189) \nThese arguments are echoed in more contemporary comments. In a recent \ninterview in the Observer, Ariel Sharon, the Israeli Prime Minister, was quoted as \nsaying 'Israel is the promised land- promised to Jews and no-one else' (13 July 2003). \nThe viewpoint has also gained ground in the U. S. via the Christian fundamentalist \nmovement, who are key supporters of George W Bush and the Republicans. A BBC \nprogramme interviewed the pastor of a major church in Texas who explained his view \nthat: \nWell you understand that the Jewish state was something that's born in the \nmind of God and we are a people who believe the scripture and the scripture \nsays very clearly that God created Israel, that God is the protector and defender \nof Israel. If God created Israel, if God defends Israel, is it not logical to say \nthat those who fight with Israel are fighting with God? (BBC Radio 4, A Lobby \nto be Reckoned With, 7 May 2002) \nOther arguments for Israel's rights to keep and settle the lands captured in \n1967 included the position that since the land has changed sovereignty many times \nover the last two thousand years, the Jews have as much claim, as any others who had \ncontrolled it since they were exiled. 20 Some Israelis have argued that since the Arabs \nrejected partition in 1947 they have given up their rights to a share of mandatory \nPalestine. Others point to the legal status of the Balfour Declaration or argue that \nsince Israel won the territories in a 'war of self-defense' they have a right to keep \n79 \nthem. Benjamin Netanyahu argues that to prevent Jews from building settlements in \nthe occupied territories is a form of apartheid: \nCareful manipulation of the media by the Arabs has left many Westerners with \nthe indelible impression that Arab paupers are being kicked off their hovels in \ndroves to make way for Jewish suburbs in the 'densely populated West \nBank. '... For what is manifestly occurring is that the West, which so sharply \ncondemned anti-black apartheid in South Africa, is being used by the Arabs as \nan enforcer of anti-Jewish apartheid that pertains in the Arab's own countries. \n(2000: 189-192) \nIn a review of Israel's settlement building programs Israel Shahak and Norton \nMezvinsky (1999) note that until 1974, Moeshe Dayan oversaw settlement activity. \nHis policy was to limit settlements primarily to Hebron, Northern Sinai and the Jordan \nValley, as part of a bargain he made with the Palestinian feudal notables who \ncontrolled the villages. After 1974 Shahak and Mezvinsky argue that religious settler \ngroups, primarily Gush Emunim, and their political allies in the Knesset came to the \nfore in determining settlement policy, with the support of both Labor and particularly \nthe Likud party. In 1973 Israel introduced the Galili Plan which Shafir suggests \ntransformed the Alon plan's 'militaryftontier to a combination of a messianic frontier \nand a suburban ftontier' (1999: 92) Some commentators have pointed to the extreme \nideological views of many religious settlers which justify attacks on Palestinians and \nattempts to expel them from the occupied territories in what is seen as a process of \n4purification' or 'sanctification' of the land .21 Hirst has suggested that even prior to \n1974, the creation of settlements was at the expense of Palestinians: \nSometimes it was necessary to uproot an entire village- though not necessarily \nall at once. For years the impoverished inhabitants of Beit Askariyah watched \nin impotent dismay as the great cantonments of the Kfar Etzion settlement \nwent up around them, relentlessly encroaching on their agricultural and \ngrazing land before swallowing up their homes too. In January 1972, the army \nexpelled 6,000 bedouins from Rafah in north-east Sinai. It demolished their \nhouses, poisoned their wells, and kept them at bay with a barbed wire fence. \nThe Bedouins were eventually employed as night watchmen or labourers- on \n80 \ntheir own property and in the service of those who had taken it from them. \n(1977: 242) \nIn 1981 the Likud administration introduced the Drobless Plan. Shafir \nsuggests that its purpose was to 'scatter Jewish settlements among Arab towns and \nvillages in order to ensure that no homogenous Palestinian inhabited area, the \npotential core of a Palestinian state would remain' (1999: 92). In a more recent study \nAmnesty International (I 999c) examined how settlement building and Palestinian \nhouse demolitions and are 'inextricably linked with Israeli policy to control and \ncolonize areas of the West Bank', a policy that has been 'energetically followed for \nover 30 years by all administrations from 1967 until the present time. ' The process of \ncolonisation the report continues depends 'not just on finding land that is physically \n'suitable'. but on alienating it from the Palestinians, defending it against Palestinian \nuse, and ensuring through such processes as registration and leasing that Palestinians \nare disqualified from having any future benefit from that land'. Amnesty International \nargue that the damage to the 'tight knit pattern of Palestinian villages' has been \npervasive. Settlement building is prohibited by the Fourth Geneva Convention, article \n49 of which stipulates that 'the occupying power shall not deport or transfer parts of \nits own population into the territory it occupies'. The Israeli government has disputed \nthis, arguing that the area is 'administered' rather than 'occupied' and that article 49 \nof the Conventions has 'no bearing' on the Israeli settlements because the Convention \nwas intended to cover forced transfers during the second world war, whilst 'the \nmovement of individuals to these areas is entirely voluntary, while the settlements \nthemselves are not intended to displace Arab inhabitants, nor do they do so in \npractice' (Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 1996). The practice has, however, been \nrepeatedly condemned by the European Union and United Nations who have deemed \nthe settlements illegal and in need of removal in multiple resolutions. The practice \nwas recently condemned in United Nations resolution 55/132 by 152 votes to four \n(Israel, United States, Micronesia, Marshall Islands) \nIn Jerusalem, Israel initiated a policy of 'Judaization' in an attempt to change \nthe demographic, physical, cultural, legal and economic status of the city. It \nappropriated Arab land in the city and demolished Arab housing. In the Jewish \nQuarter prior to 1948, approximately 20% of the property was Jewish owned. After \n1967, Hirst suggests that Israelis 'relentlessly forced out the 5,500 [Arab] inhabitants \n81 \nwho lived there' (1977: 23 5). The demolitions and evictions occurred all over the city, \nwith the victims of land expropriations receiving either inadequate levels of \ncompensation or sometimes none. Moves to change the legal and demographic \nstructure of Jerusalem have drawn criticism from the international community. In \n1999 the United Nations condemned such actions by 139 votes to one (Israel). 22 Hirst \nalso notes that Arab culture was suppressed or denigrated especially in schools. 23 The \nIsraeli state quickly moved to integrate the Arabs living in the occupied territories into \nthe Israeli economy. Some historians such as Sachar suggest that for Palestinians this \nwas a generally beneficial process creating 'unprecedented affluence' as part of a \n'comparatively painless' occupation (1977: 688-9). Other Israelis were critical of this \nprocess arguing that Israel was instituting colonial policies in which a powerful Israeli \nminority was exploiting a captive Arab population for the benefit of its cheap labour \nand its role as a market for Israeli products: \nBetter men than I have enlarged on the grim paradox that threatens the Zionist \nvision, the social and moral failure of that vision, which are to be expected \nfrom the transformation of the Jews into employers, managers and supervisors \nof Arab hewers of wood and drawers of water, and all of it plus the slogan of \n'Integration'... There is an inescapable process in a population that is divided \ninto two peoples, one dominant, the other dominated. No! The State of Israel \nwill not be such a monstrosity. (Ya'akov Talmon cited in Sachar, 1977: 713) \nThere has also been commentary in the Israeli press suggesting the conditions \nunder which the Palestinians were obliged to work for Israelis were exploitative and \nhumiliating. Palestinians with jobs in Israel were not legally allowed to spend the \nnight there so that many had to be bussed in over long distances from the occupied \nterritories, sometimes extending their working day to 17 hours. The Israeli magazine \nHaolam Haze reported on those that were permitted to sleep illegally on Israeli farms: \n'Too far away for the eye to see, hidden in the orchards, there are the sheep pens for \nthe servants, of a sort that even a state like South Africa would be ashamed of (22 \nDecember 1982, cited in Chomsky, 1999: 14 1). In a Jerusalem Post interview, the \nIsraeli j ournalist Aryeh Rubinstein asks Amos Hadar, Secretary General of the \nMoshav [agricultural] movement whether he agrees with the use of Arab labour 'but \nonly on condition that they will live in subhuman conditions, degraded, and not under \n82 \nhuman conditions, more or less? ''Correct' replies Hadar stressing that 'there is a \ndifficult question here'. 'There is no choice but to employ Arabs' but they must be \nbussed in and out of Israel every day. 'It is hard, it is costly it is problematic from an \neconomic standpoint but there is no other solution' (26 December 1982, cited in \nChomsky, 1999: 141) There has also been criticism of Israeli use of Arab child \nlabour. Israel's Arabic language communist newspaper Al-Ittihad described a child \nlabour market at Jaffa: \nIn this market foremen get rich by exploiting the labour of children and young \nmen from the occupied areas. Every morning at 4. a. m. cars from Gaza and the \nStrip start arriving there, bringing dozens of Arab workers who line up in the \nstreet in a long queue. A little later at 4: 30 a. m. Arab boys who work in \nrestaurants in the town begin to arrive. These boys work in restaurants for a \nmonth on end, including Saturdays \n... \nDozens, indeed hundreds of boys, who \nshould be at school come from Gaza to work in Israel. The cars can be seen \ncoming and going from earliest dawn. At about 6. a. m. Israeli labour brokers \nstart arriving to choose 'working donkeys' as they call them. They take great \ncare over their choice, actually feeling the 'donkeys' muscles. (30 April 1973, \ncited in Hirst, 1977: 246) \nMilitga Occupation/Administration \nIsrael imposed a military administration on the occupied territories, which seriously \nrestricted the social and political rights of its residents. According to the United \nNations and human rights groups, it also involved extensive human rights violations. \nIsrael argued that the policies were necessary to protect the state from attacks by \ninfiltrators or Palestinians in the occupied territory, who they claimed were \nsusceptible to PLO incitement. Morris suggests that that severe repression coupled \nwith 'massive use' of informers and collaborators by the Israeli security service Shin \nBet meant that armed activity by the PLO in the occupied territories was 'virtually \neradicated' by 1971 (1992: 279). Some commentators such as Chomsky, have \nsuggested that the imposition of such policies had another objective, that by making \nlife difficult for the Palestinians in the occupied territories, they would emigrate and \n83 \nallow Israel to absorb the parts of the occupied territories that it wanted, without \nhaving to worry about a large Arab population that would 'dilute' the Jewish \ncharacter of the Israeli state. Chomsky points to the official government records of a \nmeeting at the start of the Israeli occupation in September 1967, when Moeshe Dayan \nurged government ministers to tell the Palestinian residents of the occupied territories \nthat 'we have no solution, that you shall continue to live like dogs, and whoever wants \nto can leave-and we will see where this process leads... In five years we may have \n200,000 less people-and that is a matter of enormous importance' (Beilin, 1985, cited \nin Chomsky, 1992: 434). Professor Ian Lustick suggests that Israel also wanted to \nbreak up the territorial continuity of Israeli Arab villages in the Galilee and points to \nthe 1976 Koenig memorandum in which, the Israeli Minister of the Interior \nrecommended the 'coordination of a smear campaign against Rakah activists \n... \nthe \nharassment of 'all negative personalities at all levels and at all institutions' and the \nemployment of techniques for 'encouraging the emigration of Arab intellectuals, and \nfor downgrading the effectiveness of Arab university student organizations' \n(1980: 256). It is widely argued that the policies Israel instituted, breached \ninternational law. They also led to it being frequently condemned at the United \nNations General Assembly and Security Council by near unanimous votes. 24 These \npolicies included the systematic torture of prisoners 25 \n, \nimprisonment without trial26, \ncollective punishmentS27, theft of natural resources, curfews and searches 28 \n, \nhouse \ndemolitions and deportations. The practices have also attracted criticism from human \nrights groups: \nAmnesty International has for many years documented and condemned \nviolations of international human rights and humanitarian law by Israel \ndirected against the Palestinian population of the Occupied Territories. They \ninclude unlawful killings; torture and ill-treatment; arbitrary detention; unfair \ntrials; collective punishments such as punitive closures of areas and destruction \nof homes; extensive and wanton destruction of property; deportations; and \ndiscriminatory treatment as compared to Israeli settlers. Most of these \nviolations are grave breaches of the Fourth Geneva Convention and are \ntherefore war crimes. Many have also been committed in a widespread and \nsystematic manner, and in pursuit of government policy; such violations meet \n84 \nthe definition of crimes against humanity under international law. (Amnesty \nInternational, 2002) \nPalestinian Nationalism and the Rise of the Opposition Movements \nIn the aftermath of the 1948 the refugees who were displaced had begun to formulate \na vision of 'the return'. Initially it was hoped the hoped the United Nations or the \nArab States themselves would help the refugees achieve this objective. However as \nthe years passed the lack of concrete progress began to frustrate the refugees and they \nbecame increasingly disillusioned by the leaders of the Arab States. By 1964 Yasser \nArafat had established a small guerrilla organisation, which was granted a secure base \nby Syria's radical Baathist regime. Fatah's philosophy from the outset was to mobilise \npopular Arab support behind guerrilla operations of increasing scale and intensity \nconducted against Israel. Prior to the 1967 war Hirst (1977) alleges that Egypt, Jordan \nand Lebanon had all tried to prevent guerrilla incursions into Israel, but that after the \nwar this became more difficult as popular support for guerrilla operations increased. \nBy February 1968 Fatah members had taken control of the National Council of the \nPLO and Arafat became Chairman. The aftermath of the war also saw the formation \nof Dr George Habash's PFLP (Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine) began to \nbuild a strong base of support in the refugee camps of the Gaza Strip. \nIn March 1968 Israeli forces launched an attack on the Karameh refugee camp \nin Jordan. Israel claimed the attack was in retaliation for attacks 7 which had killed six \npeople and wounded 44. Fifteen thousand troops backed by tanks attacked the camp. \nRather than retreat to the hills the guerrilla forces stayed and fought and suffered huge \nlosses. Half the Palestinian guerrillas, 150 in all were killed, together with 128 \nmembers of the Jordanian army and 29 Israeli soldiers (Hirst, 1977). Although the \nguerrillas had lost many fighters it was considered a significant victory because the \nIsraelis had suffered unusually high casualties and met fierce resistance. The battle of \nKarameh led to an influx of volunteers from across the Arab world to join the \nguerrilla movements. In the years after 1967, as well as engaging in a guerrilla war, \nthe Palestinians began to formulate a vision of what a future Palestinian entity would \nlook like. The result of this was the vision of the 'Democratic State of Palestine'. The \nbrainchild of the PLO planner and negotiator Nabil Shaath, the Democratic State of \n85 \nPalestine would involve the dismantling of the Israeli state and its replacement with a \nnon-sectarian binational Palestine in which Christian, Moslem and Jew would live \ntogether in equality. (Hirst, 1977) The new entity would it was claimed include the \nJews already residing there and the Palestinians who had been displaced in 1948 and \n1967. These proposals were not immediately or universally accepted by Palestinians. \nHirst (1977) suggests that some saw them as capitulation to the enemy or at best \npremature considering that Israel was still militarily dominant. Others feared that the \nmore technologically advanced Jews would dominate them, whilst some considered it \na tactical propaganda move aimed at international opinion. The concept was a \ncomplete non-starter for almost all Israelis. Israel had been constructed out of \nPalestine with huge military and diplomatic effort as a state for the Jewish people and \nthere was no desire to dilute its Jewish character. Furthermore Israelis were fearful of \nthe extreme anti-Jewish rhetoric emanating from its Arab neighbours and worried that \nany returning refugees might want to take revenge for being displaced from their \nlands. \nIn the two years after the 1967 war the forces of Fatah and the other guerrilla \nmovements had gone from 300 to more than 30,000 and substantial funding was \ncoming in from the Arab world. The number of operations also increased \ndramatically. Fatah records claim that 98 per cent of these occurred outside the State \nof Israel with two thirds of them occurring in the West Bank. Fatah regularly insisted \nthat the army and 'Zionist institutions' were its real targets, not civilians especially \nwomen and children, and if these were attacked it was in response to attacks on \nPalestinian civilians, and was selectively done. However Hirst (1977) points out that \nalthough the 'great bulk' of attacks were aimed at military targets, civilians were \nunquestionably targeted. Bombs were planted in supermarkets in Jerusalem and bus \nstops in Tel Aviv and rockets were fired on settlements in Kiryat Shmoneh and Eilat. \nWhilst Fatah confined its actions to historic Palestine, the PFLP did not. It attacked \ntargets all over the world. It hijacked foreign airliners. It firebombed branches of \nMarks and Spencers because of their fandraising for Israel. It blew up an Arab oil \npipeline because the extraction was by an American oil company on behalf of a \n'feudal' Arab monarchy. The main purpose of these actions George Habash \nmaintained, was publicity: \n86 \nWhen we hijack a plane it had more effect than if we killed a hundred Israelis \nin battle. For decades world public opinion has been neither for nor against the \nPalestinians. It simply ignored us. At least the world is talking about us now \n(Der Stern, 19 September 1970, cited in Hirst, 1977: 304) \nHowever the opposition movements were to suffer a major blow in 1970. The \nPLO had formed a state-within-a-state in Jordan, openly threatening the rule of the \nHashemite monarchy. Following an assassination attempt on King Hussein and a \nseries of hijackings carried out by the PFLP, the King set his army upon the guerrillas. \nIn ten days of bloody struggle thousands of guerrillas were killed, and within a year \nmost of the fighters and political elements of the Palestinian movement were expelled \nand ended up in Lebanon. 'Black September' as it became known amongst \nPalestinians produced an organisation bearing the same name. Its most well known \noperation was the taking of Israeli athletes as hostages at the 1972 Munich Olympics. \nEight black September members took eleven Israeli athletes hostage at the Olympic \nvillage in Munich demanding the release of 200 Palestinians imprisoned in Israel. In \nthe German rescue operation four of the Palestinian hijackers and all eleven Israeli \nhostages were killed. Three days later Israel launched attacks on Syria and Lebanon. \nThere were reports that up to 500 people, mostly civilians, were killed in nine separate \nsimultaneous Israeli air attacks (Al-Nahar Arab Report, 18 September 1972, cited in \nHirst, 1977: 251) \nThe Phantoms and Skyhawks swooped on the suburban Damascus resort of al\u0002Hama; the bombs fell indiscriminately on Palestinians in their hillside \ndwellings and on Syrians, in their cars or strolling by the river Barada on their \nweekend outing. Survivors recounted how they were machine-gunned as they \nran for cover (Hirst, 1977: 25 1) \nIn 1973 there were further hijackings by Arab groups. In that year Israel had \nalso shot down a Libyan airliner which had strayed over the occupied Sinai peninsula, \nkilling all 106 passengers. Later, Black September militants took over the Saudi \nEmbassy in the Sudanese capital demanding the release of Palestinian militants held \nin Jordanian jails. The authorities refused and a Jordanian together with an American \nand a Belgian diplomat were killed. There followed, in quick succession, hijackings \n87 \nof Japanese, American, and Dutch airliners. The worst loss of life occurred at Rome \nairport in December 1973 when Palestinian militants killed 34, mainly American, \ncivilians. Eleven months later a British Airways VC 10 was hijacked by the Martyr \nAbu Mahmud Group, who called on the British Government to 'declare its \nresponsibility for the greatest crime in history, which was the establishment of the \nZionist entity, and foreswear the accursed Balfour Declaration, which brought \ntragedies and calamities to our region' (cited in Hirst, 1977: 321-2). In the wake of \nthis hijacking Yasser Arafat, very publicly attempted to rein in the militants by \narresting a number and amending the PLO criminal code to make hijacking that \nresulted in loss of life a capital offence. \nThe early 1970s had also seen the PLO begin to make diplomatic headway at \nthe United Nations in its quest for institutional legitimacy and support for Palestinian \nnationalism. In 1970 a General Assembly resolution was passed recognising the need \nfor Palestinian self-determination. General Assembly resolution 2649 'condemn[ed]s \nthose Governments that deny the right to self-determination of Peoples recognised as \nbeing entitled to it, especially of the peoples of southern Africa and Palestine' In 1974 \nUN resolution 3246 was passed which again stressed the need for Palestinian self\u0002determination but also added as a corollary that it was legitimate to 'struggle for \nliberation from colonial and foreign domination and alien subjugation by all available \nmeans, including armed struggle'. In November 1974 the UN adopted resolution 3236 \nwhich for established UN support for the creation of a Palestinian state: 'The General \nAssembly.... reaffirms the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people in Palestine, \nincluding (a) the right to self-determination without external interference (b) the right \nto national independence and sovereignty'. \nMany Israelis especially on the right disputed the whole notion of Palestinian \nnationalism arguing that it was a post 1967 invention created by the Arab states in \norder to wage a surrogate war against Israel. In 1969 the Israeli prime minister Golda \nMeir stated that 'It was not as though there was a Palestinian people in Palestine \nconsidering itself as a Palestinian people and we came and threw them out and took \ntheir country away from them. They did not exist' (Sunday Times, 15 June 1969, cited \nin Shlaim, 2000: 311). Similarly Netanyahu has argued that both Palestinian \nNationalism and Palestinian refugees are post- 1967 fabrications: \n88 \nIndeed, most Palestinian Arabs have homes. Many of them, in fact, live as full \ncitizens in Eastern Palestine-today called the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. \nSimilarly, most of the Arabs of Judea-Samaria are not homeless refugees; they \nlive in the same homes they occupied before the establishment of Israel. The \nnumber of actual refugees is close to nil (2000: 156-8) \nThis is disputed by multilateral bodies such as the United Nations, who have \nexplicitly recognised in many resolutions the existence of a distinct Palestinian \npeople, their rights to national self-determination, and the existence of over three and \na half million refugees. \n1973 The October War \nThe War of Attrition had failed to secure the return of the occupied Sinai for Egypt \nbut had instead left many of the Suez coastal cities devastated by Israeli raids. Shlaim \nclaims that in the early 1970s Egypt made numerous attempts to regain the occupied \nSinai through diplomacy but her peace overtures were rejected by Israel. 29 Shlaim \nsuggests Israel's 'diplomacy of attrition' together with its openly annexation plans for \nthe Sinai left Sadat with no diplomatic option and made war inevitable. \nOn 6 October 1973 Egyptian and Syrian forces attacked Israeli troop concentrations in \nthe occupied Sinai Peninsula and Golan Heights. The Arab armies achieve early \nsuccesses with the Egyptian army crossing the Suez Canal and advancing into the \nSinai, and the Syrian army forcing back the Israelis on the Golan Heights. Eventually \nthe Israeli army turned the tables and regained the territorial losses it initially \nsustained. The war cost the lives of 2,832 Jews and 8,528 Arabs (Shlaim, 2000) There \nhave been suggestions that the conflict nearly precipitated both a nuclear exchange \nbetween the superpowers and an Israeli nuclear strike on Egypt. 30 \nThe nature of the attack and the motivations of Syria and Egypt are contested. \nNetanyahu argues that the Arab forces had 'enormous advantages' over the Israelis, \nand the Israeli army had fought a 'pulverizing battle to keep the front from collapsing \nin the face of overwhelming numbers' (2000: 282). He claims that 'Israel's army was \nable, albeit by a hair's breadth, to prevent defeat in the face of a surprise attack' and \nthat having 'so little to show for an onslaught stacked so decisively in their favour' \n89 \nwas what brought Sadat to negotiating table to sign a peace treaty with Israel at Camp \nDavid in 1979 (2000: 282). In contrast, Shlaim suggests that the Egyptian/Syrian \nattack was a limited venture designed to bring Israel to the negotiating table and force \na political settlement in which the lands captured in 1967 would be returned. In an \nexact reversal of Netanyahu's thesis, Finkelstein (1999) argues that it was Israel who \nfinally agreed to come to the negotiating table at Camp David after Egypt and Syria \ndemonstrated that they possessed a 'military option'. \nFollowing the Yom Kippur war the Arab world led by Saudi Arabia instituted \nan oil embargo on the West leading to a sharp rise in oil prices, which it is argued \nprecipitated a major global recession. This again had the effect of focusing \ninternational attention on the need to resolve the conflict, or at least to neutralise some \nof its more dangerous elements. \nConflict in Lebanon \nHaving been forced out of Jordan in 1970, the PLO relocated to Lebanon from where \nit fought a guerrilla war against the Israeli state, attacking both military and civilian \ntargets. Sachar (1977) lists numerous deadly attacks by Palestinian infiltrators on \nIsraelis and argues that during the mid 1970s the 'violence continued almost without \nrespite' (1977: 8 10). Netanyahu notes that the PLO were using Lebanon as a base \nfrom which to fire Katyusha missiles across the border into Israel, which he maintains \nhad a very damaging effect on the lives of those in Israel's northern settlements: \nThe PLO used the territory of its de facto state to shell Israeli cities and towns. \nFor years, the entire population of the northern border towns and villages were \nregularly driven into underground bomb shelters by barrages of PLO launched \nKatyusha missiles, the little brothers of the Scud missiles that Iraq launched \nagainst Israel in 1991. By 1982, the population levels Kiryat Shemona and \nNahariya had fallen ominously; factories, schools and beaches were being \nclosed repeatedly to avoid mass casualties during the shellings; and fear of \neconomic ruin and depopulation had spread. (2000: 218-19) \n90 \nDuring this period Israel bombed PLO positions, Lebanese villages and \nPalestinian refugee camps. The Israeli military analyst Ze'ev Schiff justified attacks \non civilians on the basis that guerrillas used the villages and refugee camps for \nshelter: \nIn south Lebanon we struck the civilian population consciously because they \ndeserved it \n... \nthe importance of [Mordechai] Gur's [Israeli chief of staffl \nremarks is the admission that the Israeli army has always struck civilian \npopulations, purposely and consciously \n... \nthe army, he said, has never \ndistinguished civilian [from military] targets.. [but] purposely attacked civilian \ntargets even when Israeli settlements had not been struck (Haaretz, 15 May \n1978, cited in Chomsky, 1999: 181) \nThe Israeli Foreign Minister Abba Eban argued that 'there was a rational \nprospect ultimately fulfilled that affected populations would exert pressure for the \ncessation of hostilities' (Jerusalem Post, 16 August 198 1, cited in Chomsky, 1999: \n182) The Lebanese villagers though were unarmed and could do little to stop the \narmed guerrillas, and the Lebanese army was too weak to remove the Palestinians, \nwho had virtually formed a state-within-a-state. Official government casualty \nstatistics suggest that the scale of Israeli raids was disproportionate to the Palestinian \nattacks. The Israeli authorities estimated that 106 Israeli civilians were killed in \nattacks by Palestinian guerrillas on Israel's northern border in the period between \n1967 and the 1982 Israeli invasion, at a rate of approximately seven a year (Haaretz, \n22 June 1982, cited in Chomsky, 1999: 74). The American j ournalist Judith Coburn \nreported that diplomats in Beirut and UN officials estimated 3500 Lebanese citizens \nkilled between 1967 and 1975 and at least twice as many Palestinian civilians, giving \na rate of more than a thousand per year. Touring Southern Lebanon in the mid 1970s \nCoburn found many villages 'attacked almost daily in recent months \n... \nby airplane, \nartillery, tanks and gunboats' with the Israelis employing 'shells, bombs, \nphosphorous, incendiary bombs, CBUs [cluster bombs] and napalm' against Lebanese \nvillages and refugee camps as part of what she claimed was a 'scorched earth' policy \nto remove the population and create a de-militarised zone. (New Times, 7 March 1975, \ncited in Chomsky, 1977: 190). By 1977 it was estimated that 300,000 Lebanese \n91 \nMuslims had been turned into refugees by the Israeli attacks (New York Times, 2 \nOctober 1977, cited in Chomsky, 1999: 191) \nThe PLO continued its diplomatic offensive at the United Nations. In \nNovember 1974, the United Nations officially granted the PLO observer status and \nlater that month Yasser Arafat addressed the UN General Assembly for the first time, \ngiving his 'gun and olive branch' address. The leadership of the PLO argued for the \nending of the armed struggle, in return for the creation of a mini Palestinian state in \nthe West Bank and Gaza Strip and a settlement of the refugee issue. This move was \nnot accepted by all factions within the organisation, the PFLP leading the rejectionist \nwing which was against the concept of the mini-state and recognising the legitimacy \nof the Israeli state. These moves did not impress the Israelis. Israel's Foreign Minister \nclaimed that 'the voice of Arafat was, and remains the voice of indiscriminate terror, \nthe voice of the gun, with nothing in it of the olive branch of peace' (cited in Hirst, \n1977: 335). The call for the creation of a Palestinian mini state between Israel and \nJordan was similarly dismissed as a platform from which the PLO would attempt to \ndestroy Israel. The Israeli daily Yediot Aharonot argued that 'no reasonable \nperson \n... \ncan ask us to hand over these regions to the PLO, unless it expects Israel to \ncommit suicide' (14 November 1974, cited in Hirst, 1977: 336) \nIn the mid 1970s both sides as well as Syria became involved in the Lebanese \ncivil war. The relative stability which had prevailed in the country after the 1943 \npower sharing National Pact broke down in the mid 1970s, culminating in the all out \ncivil war of 1975-6. To simplify greatly, the conflict concerned two rival groupings, \nthe right-wing Christian-Maronite-Phalangist alliance backed by Israel, which was \neconomically dominant in the country, and the predominately poor majority leftist \nMuslim-Lebanese-Palestinian grouping. In mid 1976 with the leftist Muslim coalition \ngaining the upper hand in the conflict, the Syrians intervened on the side of the \nChristians occupying most of Lebanon apart from a southern strip bordering Israel. \nThe intervention of the Syrian army at the behest of the Christians (and with the tacit \nsupport of Israel) brought a truce and relative calm to all but Southern Lebanon. The \n18 months of civil war had devastated Beirut, which became partitioned, and killed \ntens of thousands of Palestinians and Lebanese. In April 1976 Israel and Syria reached \na secret agreement with American mediation, splitting the area into 'spheres of \ninfluence'. Syria agreed to keep its troops north of the Litani River and not to install \nsurface to air missiles there, recognising Southern Lebanon as Israel's security buffer. \n92 \nIn the mid 1970s Israel began supplying the two major Christian Maronite \nmilitias, the Phlangists and Chamouns with weapons. Jonathan Randal (1983), the \nformer senior foreign correspondent of the Washington Post suggests was \nstrategically useful for Israel because it tied down two of Israel's enemies, the Syrians \nand Palestinians, both of whom had come into conflict with the Christians by 1977. \nIsrael was also backing General Haddad's South Lebanon Army which was acting as \nits proxy force in South Lebanon. Randal (1983) notes that this was controversial \nbecause Haddad's forces had been involved in serious abuses including many \ninstances of large scale killings of civilians and involvement in the unlawful deaths of \nUN personnel. In 1978 Israel mounted a large scale invasion of Southern Lebanon \nclaiming that it was in response to a Palestinian attack in Israel which had left 37 \nIsraelis and nine Palestinians dead. The scale and effects of the invasion are disputed. \nGilbert claims that 'several dozen PLO soldiers were killed or captured' and 'all PLO \ninstallations were systematically destroyed' (1999: 490). Randal claims it was \ncivilians rather than guerrillas who bore the brunt of the attack: \nThe destruction was a scale well known in Vietnam. Aping the prodigal use of \nAmerican firepower in Indochina, the Israelis sought to keep their own \ncasualties to a minimum- and succeeded. But they failed to wipe out the \nPalestinian commandoes, who had plenty of time to scamper to safety north of \nthe Litani River. Piling mattresses, clothes and families in taxis and \noverloaded pickup trucks, more than two hundred thousand Lebanese also fled \nnorth out of harm's way. They became exiles in their own country, squatters \nseizing unoccupied apartments, the source of yet more tension in West Beirut. \nThe Israelis did succeed in massive killing: almost all the victims were \nLebanese civilians-some one thousand according to the International \nCommittee of the Red Cross. More than six thousand homes were badly \ndamaged or destroyed. Half a dozen villages were all but levelled in a frenzy \nof violence in which Israeli troops committed atrocities (1983: 209) \nAfter three months under pressure from the United Nations, who condemned \nthe attack, the IDF withdrew from southern Lebanon replaced by a United Nations \nforce. Most of the positions abandoned by the IDF were taken by the SLA. In January \n1979 Ezer Weizman, the Israeli Defence Secretary announced a controversial pre\u000293 \nemptive policy against Palestinian guerrillas in Southern Lebanon. He declared that \nIsrael would not only strike in retaliation but 'at any time and any place that Israel \ndeemed desirable' (cited in Randal, 1983: 220). In 1981 hostilities escalated in \nLebanon. On July 17 Israel launched a major bombing raid on Southern Lebanon \nhitting refugee camps, ports, Lebanon's main oil refinery and all but one of the \nbridges over the Litani and Zahrani rivers (Randal, 1983). The Israelis claimed that \nthe raids were necessary to deal with a PLO arms build-up in Southern Lebanon. The \nPalestinians held fire for three days and then began shelling and rocketing Northern \nIsrael. On July 17 Israel bombed the Fakhani district in West Beirut, home to the PLO \noffices. More than one hundred and twenty Palestinian and Lebanese civilians were \nkilled leading to international condemnation of the raid. The Palestinians then \nlaunched artillery attacks on twenty eight Israeli towns and settlements damaging \ncrops and orchards, whilst tens of thousands of Israelis were temporarily forced to flee \ntheir homes in northern Israel (Randal, 1983). In the wake of this exchange both sides \nagreed to an American brokered ceasefire. \nDiplomacy and the Camp David Accords \nDuring this period a number of attempts were made by the Palestinians to push for a \npeace settlement. Palestinian representatives put forward a United Nations Security \nCouncil resolution in January 1976 which called for a two state solution on the 1967 \nborders 'with appropriate arrangements \n.... \nto guarantee \n.... \nthe sovereignty, territorial \nintegrity and political independence of all states in the area and their right to live in \npeace within secure and recognised boundaries. ' (UN Security Council Resolution \nS/1 1940). The resolution received nine votes in favour including France and the \nSoviet Union but was blocked by a single vote against from the United States. \nChomsky (1999) points to PLO acceptance of the Soviet-American peace plan of \nOctober 1977, the Soviet peace plan of 1981 and the Saudi 1982 peace plan as well as \na number of public statements by PLO representatives in the late 1970s that the \nPalestinians were proposing to end the armed struggle in exchange for the creation of \na mini-state in Gaza and the West Bank .31 He notes that all such overtures were \nrejected by Israel. Some Israelis such as Benjamin Netanyahu have dismissed all \nPalestinian peace overtures as part of an attempt to force Israel to accept a PLO \n94 \n'Trojan horse' whose purpose is to destroy the Israeli state. He argues that after the \n1973 war the Palestinians realised they couldn't destroy Israel with a 'frontal military \nassault' but were planning 'an interim phase in which Israel would be reduced to \ndimensions that made it more convenient for the coup de grace'. This would be \nachieved in two phases 'first create a Palestinian state on any territory vacated by \nIsrael' and 'second mobilize from that state a general Arab military assault to destroy \na shrunken and indefensible Israel' (2000: 239). Netanyahu claims that the Arabs \nhave been deceiving the Western nations with a moderate front: \nFor the PLO is a Pan-Arab Trojan Horse, a gift that the Arabs have been trying \nto coax the Arabs into accepting for over twenty years, so that the West in turn \ncan force Israel to let it in at the gates. The Arabs paint their gift up prettily \nwith legitimacy with the pathos of its plight, with expressions for the \ncherished ideas of freedom, justice, and peace. Yet no matter how it is dressed \nup to conceal the fact, the ultimate aim of the gift remains: to be allowed \nwithin Israel's defensive wall, to be parked on the hills overlooking Tel-Aviv, \nwhere it can perfon-n its grisly task. Every inch of Western acceptance -the \ncover stories the banquets, the observer status, the embassies, and any territory \nthe PLO has been able to get its hands on-it uses to push ever closer to its goal. \n(2000: 256) \nIn March 1978,350 Israeli reservists sent a letter to Begin which accused the \ngovernment of preferring to build settlements and create a 'Greater Israel' rather than \nmake peace with the Arab world. This was partly in response to Prime Minister \nBegin's decision to support the creation of a number of new Gush Emunim \nsettlements deep in the occupied territories. The letter marked the creation of the \nPeace Now movement which in September 1978 organised a mass rally of 100,000 \nIsraelis in Tel-Aviv, the largest political demonstration in the state's history. The \nEuropean Economic Community also pushed for a solution to the conflict during \n1979. Leaders of the EEC meeting in Venice in June 1979 issued statements \nsupportive of Palestinian statehood, and the president-elect of the European \nCommission Gaston Thom travelled to the Middle East and met Yasser Arafat. The \nPLO was recognised by Ireland and Austria and Giscard d'Estaing recommended the \ngroup be accepted as a partner in peace negotiations. The Europeans also attempted to \n95 \nwiden 242 to include Palestinian self-determination. Ovendale (1999) claims that the \nUnited States made it clear that it would veto any European resolution in the Security \nCouncil which supported Palestinian rights. \nIn March 1979 Israel signed a peace agreement with Egypt in Washington, on \nterms very simi ar to the ones rejected by Israel in 1972. The progress to the final \nsettlement had been long and tortuous involving diplomacy stretching over several \ncontinents and many years. Israel agreed to hand back the Sinai peninsula in exchange \nfor a comprehensive peace treaty, and demilitarisation of most of the Sinai. Both \nparties had compromised. Israelis agreed to remove the settlements and airfields, \nEgypt dropped the issue of Jerusalem, and the two sides agreed on only a vague \nautonomy plan for the Palestinians that would be implemented in stages over a \nnumber of years. The two signatories took a great deal of criticism over the \nconclusion of the peace treaty. Begin was attacked by the right and religious parties \nfor returning the Sinai, while Sadat was criticised for breaking with Arab unity, by \nsigning a peace treaty with Israel without having achieved a deal on Jerusalem, \nPalestinian statehood or a full Israeli withdrawal from Arab territory. Finkelstein \n(2001) suggests that the Israeli government agreed to peace with Egypt because it \nwould neutralise the most powerful Arab military force threatening it, and \nsubsequently allow it to break the nexus of the Palestinian national movement in \nLebanon. On 30 July 1980 the Israeli government formally annexed all of Jerusalem, \nand the following year the Golan Heights were annexed in violation of the Israel\u0002Egypt peace agreement and resolution 242. Both annexations drew immediate \ncondemnation from the UN Security Council (Resolutions 478 and 497) who declared \nthe annexations illegal, and demanded their rescission. The plans for Palestinian \nautonomy were not developed. Shlaim suggests that the Begin administration \ndeliberately sabotaged the autonomy negotiations and expanded expropriations of \nPalestinian land and settlement building, because it wanted to retain control over the \nWest Bank and Gaza Strip: \nBegin managed the autonomy talks in such a way that nothing could possibly \nbe achieved. The first sign was Begin's appointment of Dr. Yosef Burg, the \nminister of the interior, to head Israel's six-man negotiating team. Burg was \nthe leader of the National Religious Party, which saw Israel's right to Judea \n96 \nand Samaria as embedded in Scripture and supported the settlement activities \nof Gush Emunim. (2000: 381-2) \nThe Invasion of Lebanon 1982 \nOn 6 June 1982 Israel invaded Lebanon and attacked PLO forces. It also engaged the \nSyrian army in its drive towards Beirut. In the early days of the conflict the Economist \ncorrespondent G. H. Jansen reported that the Israeli policy was to surround towns and \ncities 'so swiftly that civilian inhabitants were trapped inside, and then to pound them \nfrom land, sea and air. After a couple of days there would be a timid probing attack: if \nthere was resistance the pounding would resume' (Middle East International, 2 July \n1982, cited in Chomsky, 1999: 219). By the time an American sponsored cease-fire \ncame into effect on 11 June the Israeli army had reached the southern outskirts of \nBeirut. Shlaim (2000) suggests that Israel was expecting their Christian allies in \nLebanon, led by Bashir Gemayel, to attack the PLO forces who by this time, were \ntrapped in West Beirut. However Gemayel was reluctant to take on the Palestinians \nand the Israelis did not want to get involved in potentially costly street fighting. By 13 \nJune the Israelis had surrounded Beirut and for the next two months they laid siege to \nthe city and bombarded it with heavy weaponry. The Israeli commander Ariel Sharon \nwho led the Israeli attack claimed that 'no army in the history of modem warfare ever \ntook such pains to prevent civilian casualties as did the Israeli Defence Forces' and \nthat the 'Jewish doctrine\" of tohar haneshek (purity of arms) was adhered to \n4 scrupulously' with the Israeli army 'attacking only predetermined PLO Positions and \nin bombing and shelling buildings only when they served as PLO strongholds' (New \nYork Times, 29 August 1982, cited in Chomsky, 1999: 243-4). Gilbert (1999) also \nstressed that the Israelis concentrated their attacks on PLO strongholds, although he \nnotes that on one occasion a hospital was seriously damaged. Others reports from \njournalists in Beirut suggested that the Israeli attacks were indiscriminate. The \nIndependent journalist Robert Fisk claimed the Israelis were employing 'time-on \ntarget salvoes' which 'laid 50 shells at a time' across residential areas 'slaughtering \neveryone within a 500 yard radius of the explosions' (2001: 284). He also claimed \nthat the Israelis used cluster bombs, and phosphorous bombs, which were designed to \ncreate fires and cause untreatable bums. The Israeli daily Ha'aretz reported that \n97 \nvacuum bombs, which ignite aviation fuel in such a way as to create immense \npressure and literally implode large buildings, were also dropped on residential areas \n(I I August 1982). A Canadian surgeon Chris Giannou who had been working in a \nPalestinian hospital testified before the US Congress that he had witnessed the 'total, \nutter devastation of residential areas, and the blind, savage, indiscriminate destruction \nof refugee camps by simultaneous shelling and carpet bombing from aircraft, \ngunboats, tanks and artillery'. He testified that cluster bombs and phosphorous bombs \nhad been used widely in residential areas and that he had seen 'savage and \nindiscriminate beatings' of prisoners, which were sometimes fatal as well as frequent \nuse of torture. 32 The bombing intensified during July and August and Hirsh Goodman \nreported it continued even after an agreement in principle for the PLO to leave had \nbeen reached (Jerusalem Post, I October 1982, cited in Chomsky, 1999: 241). In July \nsupplies of food, water, medicines and fuel were cut to the city. By August 4 Elaine \nCarey reported that eight of the nine orphanages in Beirut had been destroyed by \ncluster and phosphorous bombs, despite clear markings and Israeli assurances that \nthey would be spared (Christian Science Monitor, 4 August 1982, cited in Chomsky, \n1999: 225). On August 12 the bombing reached a peak. The American journalist \nCharles Powers argued that: \nTo many the siege of Beirut seemed gratuitous brutality \n... \nThe arsenal of \nweapons unleashed in a way that has not been seen since the Vietnam war, \nclearly horrified those who saw the results firsthand and through film and \nnews reports at a distance. The use of cluster bombs and white phosphorous \nshells, a vicious weapon was widespread \n... \nIn the last hours of the last air \nattack on Beirut, Israeli planes carpet bombed Borg el Brajne [a refugee \ncamp]. There were no fighting men left there only the damaged homes of \nPalestinian families, who once again would have to leave and find another \nplace to live. (Los Angeles Times, 29 August 1982, cited in Chomsky, 1999: \n242) \nEventually at the end of August the PLO forces were evacuated from Beirut to \nTunis. Outside Beirut there were reports of widespread destruction of refugee camps \nand Lebanese villages. In Sidon, Fisk claims over 2000 Lebanese civilians were killed \nin air attacks he describes as 'the most ferocious ever delivered upon a Lebanese city' \n98 \n(2000: 204). The head of the UN refugee agency that administered the camps Olof \nRydbeck said that 32 years of work had been 'wiped out' with 'practically all of the \nschools, clinics and installations of the agency in ruins. '(New York Times, 19 August \n1982, cited in Chomsky, 1999: 223). The scale of civilian and PLO casualties during \nthe war are contested. Gilbert (1999) claims that 460 Lebanese civilians and 6000 \nPLO fighters were killed. The Lebanese police estimated 19,085 killed though to \nAugust with 6775 killed in Beirut, 84 per cent of them civilians (Christian Science \nMonitor, 21 December 1982, cited in Chomsky, 1999: 221). The United Nations \nestimated 13,500 houses severely damaged in West Beirut, thousands more in other \nparts of the country, not taking into account damage to the refugee camps which were \ntowns themselves (Christian Science Monitor 18 November 1982, cited in Chomsky, \n1999: 223). There were also reports that all the teenage and adult Lebanese and \nPalestinian males, were taken to camps where they were humiliated and tortured. 33 \nChomsky cites testimony from the IDF Lieutenant Colonel Dov Yirmiah which \nappeared in the Israeli daily Yediot A hronot on the fate of Palestinian and Lebanese \ndetainees: \nHe tells story after story of prisoners savagely and endlessly beaten in \ncaptivity, of torture and humiliation of prisoners, and of the many who died of \nbeatings and thirst in Israeli prisons or concentration camps in Lebanon \n.... \nThe \nlong and repeated interrogations were accompanied by constant beatings, or \nattacks by dogs on leashes, or the use of air rifles that cause intense pain but \ndo not kill... New loads of clubs had to be brought into the camps to replace \nthose broken under interrogation. The torturers were 'experts in their work, ' \nthe prisoners report, and knew how to make blows most painful, including \nblows to the genitals, until the prisoners confessed that they were 'terrorists' \n(8 November 1982, cited in 1999: 240) \nOther reports in the Israeli press claimed that members of the Israel's proxy \nmilitia the South Lebanon Army were allowed in the camps to torture prisoners and \nthat some gang raped women and attempted to force them to have sex with dogs \n(Koteret Rashit, 16 March 1983, cited in Chomsky, 1999: 236). After the PLO had \nagreed to leave Lebanon one of the war's most notorious incidents occurred at the \nrefugee camps at Shatila and Sabra. After the departure of the PLO from Lebanon, the \n99 \nIsraeli forces sealed off the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps on September 16 and \nallowed in between 100 and 130 Phalangist and Haddadist troops. Ariel Sharon \nclaimed that the camps contained 2,000 well armed Palestinian fighters and the \nChristian forces had been sent in to clear them out. However Edward Walsh argues \nthat 'no one has publicly explained how the Israelis expected 100 to 130 Phalangists \nto defeat such a force of Palestinians' (Washington Post 26 December 1982, cited in \nChomsky, 1999: 369), and in a visit to the camp a few days before the killings \njournalists reported finding no military presence (Time, 4 October 1982, cited in \nChomsky, 1999: 369). Once in the camps the Phalangist forces raped and killed many \nof the camps inhabitants who were primarily women, children and the elderly. The \ndeath toll is disputed. The official Israeli Kahan Commission estimated 7-800 killed, \nthe Lebanese authorities pit the figure at approximately 2,000, whilst the Israeli \nj ournalist Amnon Kapeliouk (1984) citing evidence from the International Committee \nof the Red Cross estimated 3-3,500. Responsibility for the killings have also been \npartly attributed to the United States who gave explicit assurances that the Muslim \ncivilian population of West Beirut would be protected as part of the PLO deal to \nevacuate Beirut (Ovendale, 1999). The massacres were condemned by the United \nNations by 147 votes to two (Israel, United States), and international lawyers in \nBelgium have since attempted to indict the Israel commanders Ariel Sharon and \nAmos Yaron for war crimes. \nThe Lebanon war appeared to split Israeli society. Some questioned whether \nthe scale of death and destruction inflicted on Southern Lebanon was proportionate to \nthe threat posed by Palestinian militants. In 1983 a debate on Zionism was held at Tel\u0002Aviv University where Aluf Hareven of the Van Leer Institute commented: \nAccording to the figures provided by the Ministry of the Interior Yosef Burg, \nin 1980,10 Jews were killed by terrorists and in 1981- 8. In contrast we have \nkilled about a thousand terrorists in 1982, and caused the loss of life of \nthousands of inhabitants of an enemy country. If so, it results that for every 6- \n8 Jews sacrificed, we kill in return thousands of Gentiles. This is undoubtedly, \na spectacular situation, an uncommon success of Zionism. I might even dare to \nsay-exaggerated. (Migvan, OctoberNovember 1982, cited in Chomsky 1999: \n74) \n100 \nThe massacres at Sabra and Shatila also led to the largest protests in Israel's \nhistory. On the September 25 1982 more than 400,000 Israelis joined a Peace Now \ndemonstration in Tel-Aviv. Others suggested that a large part of the population was \nunconcerned if not approving of the events at the refugee camps: \nIn the matter of Sabra and Shatila- a large part of the community, perhaps the \nmajority, is not at all troubled by the massacre itself. Killing of Arabs in \ngeneral, and Palestinians in particular, is quite popular, or at least 'doesn't \nbother anyone' in the words of youth these days. Ever since the massacre I \nhave been surprised to hear from educated, enlightened people, 'the \nconscience of Tel Aviv', the view that the massacre itself, as a step towards \nremoving the remaining Palestinians from Lebanon is not terrible. It is just too \nbad that we were in the neighbourhood (Haaretz, 19 November 1982, cited in \nChomsky, 1999: 395) \nIsrael's motives for launching the attack are contested. Mitchell Bard (2003), \nthe director of the American-Israeli Cooperative Institute, points to three reasons for \nIsrael's decision to attack Lebanon. Firstly he claims that the PLO were repeatedly \nbreaching the ceasefire negotiated by the Americans in July 1981 and attacking \nIsraelis across the Lebanese border. Secondly he alleges that 15-18,000 PLO members \nwere encamped in Southern Lebanon and were equipping themselves with a huge \narsenal including rockets, surface to air missiles, mortars, tanks and enough weapons \nto arm five brigades. He suggests that Israeli strikes and commando raids could not \nprevent the emergence of this 'PLO army'. Finally Bard points to the attempt on the \nlife of the Israeli ambassador to London Shlomo Argov by the Abu Nidal group. All \n34 \nof these explanations have been disputed \n. \nShlaim suggests that Israel had two \nobjectives, to create a new political order in Lebanon and to 'destroy the PLO's \nmilitary infrastructure in Lebanon and to undermine it as a political organisation' \n(2000: 396). Former IDF education officer Mordechai Bar-on argued that 'there is no \ndoubt that the [war's] central aim was to deal a crushing blow to the national \naspirations of the Palestinians and to their very existence as a nation endeavouring to \ndefine itself and gain the right to self-determination' (New Outlook, October 1982, \ncited in Chomsky 1999: 203). With the PLO infrastructure destroyed and the refugees \n101 \ndispersed, some commentators suggest that the organisation might revert to hijacking \nand therefore undermine its growing political status: \nIf the PLO were now thrown out of Lebanon-or, better yet, reduced to mad \ndog terrorism that would destroy its growing political and diplomatic \nlegitimacy-then Israel stood a better chance of annexing the West Bank and \nGaza strip still thoroughly loyal to Arafat's leadership despite his many errors. \n(Randal, 1983: 250) \nShlaim (2000) suggests that another aspect of Sharon's 'big plan' was to install \nIsrael's Christian ally Bashir Gemayel in power in Lebanon, and force the Palestinian \nrefugees out of Lebanon to Jordan, leading to the overthrow of the Hashemite \nmonarchy and its conversion to a Palestinian state, thereby weakening international \npressure on Israel to vacate the West Bank and allowing Israel to annex the territory. \nNeither of the larger geo-strategic aims were achieved. Bashir Gemayel was \nassassinated shortly after the war whilst the Hashemite monarchy remained intact in \nJordan. \nIn the aftermath of the Sabra and Shatila killings, American marines returned \nto Lebanon as part of a multinational force. They however soon came into conflict \nwith Shia and Druze forces opposed to Israel's occupation of Southern Lebanon. \nWhen US warships shelled Druze positions, it appeared that the US had entered the \ncivil war in support of the Christian-Israeli alliance. On 23 October a suicide bomber \nkilled 256 American and 58 French troops leading to the withdrawal of American and \nEuropean forces. A Shiite group with links to Iran later claimed responsibility for the \nattack. Ovendale (1999) claims that after the 1982 war Israel and the United States \nstrengthened their political and military ties, by embarking on joint weapons projects. \nIn 1986 the Israeli nuclear technician Mordechai Vanunu revealed to a Sunday Times \ninterview the existence of Israel's substantial nuclear arsenal, revelations which were \nto earn the Israeli an 18 year prison term. Recent newspaper reports suggest that the \nIsraeli nuclear arsenal has increased to approximately 200 warheads, many of which \nare fitted to American supplied Harpoon cruise missiles capable of hitting any of \nIsrael's Arab neighbours (Observer, October 12 2003). \nIn the mid 1980s further attempts were also made to find a negotiated solution \nto the conflict. In February 1985 Yasser Arafat and King Hussein of Jordan issued the \n102 \nAmman Declaration which proposed Palestinian self-determination within a \nPalestinian-Jordanian confederation. The composition of the negotiating team proved \na problem with Israel refusing to negotiate with any PLO members. Margaret \nThatcher attempted to push the plan and proposed a peace conference to include PLO \nmembers. However the plans were derailed by a series of events. Firstly Abu Nidal, \nbacked by Syria, threatened to assassinate any PLO members who accepted \nThatcher's invitation. Then on 25 September 1985 three Israelis were killed on a boat \nin Larnaca. The Israeli government blamed the PLO. The PLO claimed the three were \nMossad agents. Israel then dispatched a number of American made F- 16 fighters to \nbomb the PLO headquarters in Tunis. In the attack, 58 Palestinians and 15 Tunisians \nwere killed. The attack was supported by US but condemned by the European \nCommunity and United Nations. Soon afterwards a small Palestinian group, the \nPalestine Liberation Front hijacked the Achille Lauro and killed an elderly Jewish \npassenger before surrendering. Following the hijacking the US pressurised Britain to \ncancel a scheduled meeting between the Foreign Secretary and PLO members. Britain \nthen insisted that the PLO members sign a statement denouncing all fon-ns of political \nviolence. The PLO members refused, arguing that this would cover armed resistance \nto the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and the meeting was \ncancelled. Soon afterwards King Hussein of Jordan announced the end of his \ncollaboration with the PLO leadership blaming Arafat's refusal to accept resolutions \n242 and 338. In the wake of this rupture between the PLO and Jordan, King Hussein \nand Shimon Peres kept close diplomatic links and considered ways of restarting peace \ntalks whilst excluding any members of the PLO from negotiations (Shlaim, 2000). \nIsrael's pursuance of the 'Jordanian option' Shlaim suggests was blocked by the \nIsraeli premier Yitzak Shamir who was opposed to any international conference \nwhich might involve pressure from outside mediators. \n1987: The First Intifada \nOn December 9 1987, following the death of four Gazans the previous day, in a road \ntraffic incident Palestinians from the Jebalya refugee camp began throwing stones at \nan Israeli army compound. Within days unrest spread to the West Bank. Unarmed \nPalestinian men, women, and children attacked Israeli soldiers and armoured \n103 \npersonnel carriers. Benny Morris claims that the Intifada was 'not an armed rebellion \nbut a massive, persistent campaign of civil resistance, with strikes and commercial \nshutdowns accompanied by violent (though unarmed) demonstrations against the \noccupying forces' (1992: 561). The factors behind the Intifada, which was to last six \nyears until it was called off by the Palestinian leadership in the wake of the Oslo \nagreements, are contested. Netanyahu has argued that the Israeli administration in the \noccupied territories had instituted a 'liberal policy aimed at radically improving the \nlives of the Palestinians' and that material and educational prosperity had gone hand \nin hand with political rights including 'a press consisting of newspapers representing \nvarious factions (some openly sympathetic to the PLO) and the right to directly appeal \nall decisions to the democratic court system' (2000: 176). He argues that the impetus \nfor the Intifada was 'virulent PLO agitation' that led the population in the occupied \nterritories to adopt 'ever more extreme and implacable positions' (2000: 177). He also \nclaims that the PLO had forced children out of their schools to take part in \nconfrontations with Israeli forces. Gilbert blames Jordan for not integrating the \nPalestinians living in the West Bank into Jordanian society before 1967, and argues \nthat the impetus for the Intifada came from a 'bitter hard core of extremists who were \nprepared to face Israeli bullets in order to defy the occupiers and assert their national \nidentity' (1999: 525) Some Israelis blamed outside agitation for the Intifada. Yitzak \nRabin accused Iran and Syria of fermenting unrest. Others have questioned whether \nIsraeli policy in the occupied territories was really liberal and suggest that the Intifada \nwas the result of severe and persistent human rights abuses. A report by the Israeli \nCommittee for Solidarity with Bir Zeit (the West Bank University periodically closed \nby the Israeli authorities) described the Israeli administration in the occupied \nterritories as an 'attempt to revive an old well-known colonial method in a new \n'original' Israeli form' in order to create 'an Israeli Bantustan, which imposes on the \nPalestinians the role of hewers of wood and drawers of water for Israeli society'. To \nachieve this the report claimed that there was widespread and violent suppression of \nall forms of political activity, and that 'quislings from the Village Leagues' together \nwith settler groups inflicted 'humiliation, harassment and terror' on the local \npopulation. 35 The United Nations also produced a number of reports in the mid 1980s \nwhich were critical of Israeli human rights abuses in the occupied territories and \npointed to widespread acts of violence committed against Palestinians by armed \n104 \nsettlers. 36 Israel Shahak, argues that such abuses were the main factor behind the \nIntifada and cites examples from the Israeli press: \nIn fact, before the Intifada, the daily oppression, humiliations, land \nconfiscations and arbitrariness of the Israeli regime were steadily increasing. \nThis increase, duly recorded by the Hebrew press, was the chief reason for the \noutbreak of the Intifada. Readers of Israel's Hebrew-language press are aware \nof how outrageously the Israeli armed forces were behaving before the \nIntifada. On June 19,1987, Eyal Ehrlich reported in an article in Haaretz \nheadlined, 'An occupier against his will, ' the testimony of a young Israeli \nsoldier assigned to serve in the border guards. Whenever a Palestinian is \naccosted to show his I. D., the soldier wrote, its checking is always \naccompanied by 'a slap, a punch. a kick. ' 'The border guards usually enjoy \nbeating the Arabs, ' the account continues. They derive pleasure from \nit \n... \nSometimes I feel like a Nazi when I watch my friends in action. I try hard \nto stay away from one of my commanders \n... \nHe always behaves very badly \ntoward the locals: with violence, beatings, and the like \n... \nThe soldiers spit in \nthe faces of the Arabs, or they kick them in the testicles. And there is always \nthat slap in the face. ' An article in Hadashot of July 7,1987 by Menahem \nShizaf was headlined, 'Border guards order the Arabs to masturbate and to \nlick the floor. ' It described the treatment meted out to Palestinian workers \nfrom the occupied territories who were found spending the night in shacks in \nIsrael rather than returning to their homes. (Washington Report on Middle East \nAffairs, March 1991) \nThe Israeli Minister of Defence Yitzak Rabin explained that the Israeli \nresponse to the Intifada would consist of 'force, might, beatings' (New York Times, 23 \nJanuary 1988, cited in the New York Review ofBooks, 17 March 1988), whilst Prime \nMinister Shamir was reported in the Israeli publication Hadashot as warning those \nprotesting the occupation that they would be crushed 'like grasshoppers' with their \nheads 'smashed against the boulders and walls' and that 'we say to them from the \nheights of this mountain and from the perspective of thousands of years of history that \nthey are like grasshoppers compared to us' (6 January 1988, cited in Chomsky, 1999: \n482). By February 1988 the Intifada became formalised with the establishment of the \n105 \nUnited National Leadership of the Uprising. The organisation encouraged strikes \namongst those who worked in Israel and attacks on the Israeli administrative \nstructure. Taxes were withheld, those who worked as administrators and tax collectors \nresigned and Israeli goods were boycotted (Ovendale, 1999). Roadblocks were set up \nto keep out the Israeli army and Palestinians tried to create an alternative system of \nlocal self-government independent of the military authority. \nIn February 1988 the United States attempted to put forward a peace plan \nbased on Palestinian autonomy in the occupied territories. The plan was rejected by \nIsrael, and the PLO who noted it made no mention of statehood. In April Abu Jihad, \nthe PLO second in command was assassinated by Israel in Tunis. The Tunisian \ngovernment complained to the United Nations Security Council. The Israeli daily \nMa'ariv later reported that the future Prime Minister Ehud Barak had directed the \nassassination from a navy ship off Tunis (4 July 1988). In July King Hussein of \nJordan announced that his country was severing its links with the West Bank \neffectively killing the 'Jordanian option' that had long been favoured by the US and \nsome Israeli leaders. In September Yasser Arafat told the European Parliament in \nStrasbourg, that the PLO would accept Israel's right to security if Israel recognised a \nPalestinian mini-state. In November the Palestinian National Council meeting in \nAlgiers agreed to recognise Israel, as well as all UN resolutions dating back to 1947 \nand to foreswear its claim to all of mandatory Palestine. It also proclaimed the \nestablishment of the state of Palestine with East Jerusalem as its capital. The Israeli \nPrime Minister, Shamir, dismissed the resolutions as a 'deceptive propaganda \nexercise, intended to create the impression of moderation and of achievements for \nthose carrying out violent acts in the territories of Judea and Samaria' (cited in \nShlaim, 2000: 466). Yasser Arafat wanted to appeal to the UN General Assembly, \nbut despite being recognised by more than sixty nations the United States refused him \nan entry visa (Ovendale, 1999). The General Assembly then voted to hold its plenary \nsession in Geneva, and Arafat under strong pressure from the American Secretary of \nState, George Shultz, announced that the PLO accepted resolutions 242 and 338, as \nwell as Israel's right to exist and renounced 'terrorism'. \nMeanwhile Israel's response to the Intifada was attracting widespread \ninternational criticism. By January 1989 the US State Department reported that the \nunrest had claimed the lives of eleven Israelis and 366 Palestinians. Some on the \n106 \nIsraeli right argued that the criticism of Israel and media coverage of the Intifada was \nbiased and unfair, and that the Israeli response was restrained and proportionate: \nIgnoring the Arab reign of terror in the Palestinian streets, the media created \nfor themselves nightly instalments of a popular romance drama: heroic \nunderdog in search of self-determination taking on a terrifying Israeli \ntyrant \n... \nSince viewers were being told this was an 'army of occupation'- that \nis, it had no right to be there in the first place- the media managed to transform \neven the most necessary aspects of maintaining law and order into \nunforgivable crimes. Utterly lost from the images on the screen was the \norganised nature of the rioting, the internecine violence, and the terrorised \nlives of the innocent Arabs (and Jews) who were ground under the intifada's \nheel. Similarly lost were the restrictive firing orders that stayed the hand of \nevery Israeli soldier, and the swift trial of the 208 Israelis who in any way \ndisobeyed these orders- as against the tens of thousands of Israeli soldiers and \nreservists who followed the regulations with impeccable restraint. (2000: 18 1- \n2) \nThe United Nations, NGOs, human rights groups and some Israeli soldiers \ndisputed this. In December 1988 the United Nations General Assembly passed a \nresolution by 106 to 2 (Israel, United States) which condemned the conduct of the \nIDF and settlers during the Intifada. The resolution \nDeclare[d] once more that Israel's grave breaches of that Convention are war \ncrimes and an affront to humanity'. Amongst many criticisms the resolution \n4 strongly condemned' the 'implementation of an 44iron-fist\" policy against the \nPalestinian people \n... \nthe escalation of Israeli brutality since the beginning of \nthe uprising \n... \nthe Ill-treatment and torture of children and minors under \ndetention and/or imprisonment \n... \nthe killing and wounding of defenceless \ndemonstrators \n... \nthe breaking of bones and limbs of thousands of civilians \n... \nthe \nusage of toxic gas, which resulted, inter alia, in the killing of many \nPalestinians' (United Nations, 1988). \n107 \nIsrael was particularly criticised for its treatment of children during the \nIntifada. A thousand page Save the Children study documented the 'indiscriminate \nbeating, teargassing, and shooting of children. ' The report found that the average age \nof the victims was ten years old and that the majority of those who were shot were not \nparticipating in stone throwing. The report also alleged that in 80% of cases where \nchildren were shot the Israeli army prevented the victims from receiving medical \nattention. The report concluded that more than 50,000 children required medical \nattention for injuries including gun shot wounds, tear gas inhalation and multiple \nfractures (report cited in Finkelstein, 1996: 47). The August 198 9 bulletin f rom \nthe Israeli League for Human and Civil Rights was entitled 'Deliberate Murder' and \nreported on the targeting of Palestinian children in leadership roles. It found that the \nIsraeli army and snipers from 'special units' had 'carefully chosen' the children who \nwere shot in the head or heart and died instantaneously (report cited in Finkelstein, \n1996: 47). Others reports from Israelis human rights groups and articles in the Israeli \npress also allege that torture, including severe beating and electric shocks were used \nextensively against detainees including children. 37 \nThe Intifada also saw the birth of Hamas, the Islamic opposition movement \nformed by Sheik Yassin in February 1988. The organisation which emerged out of the \nMuslim Brotherhood, stressed a return to conservative Islamic values and provided a \nnetwork of health, and social services for Palestinians in the occupied territories. For \nmany years the organisation received extensive funding from Israel (Shlaim, 2000; \nChomsky, 1999; Mishal & Sela. 2000). Shlaim claims that this was done 'in the hope \nof weakening the secular nationalism of the PLO' (2000: 459) Chomsky (1999) \nsuggests such a weakening would be beneficial to Israel because it would allow them \nto evade a political solution to the conflict which might involve returning the \noccupied territories. The Hamas charter issued in August 1988 argued that all of \nPalestine belonged to the Muslim nation as a religious endowment and that it was \neach Muslim's duty to engage in jihad (a religious war) to 'liberate' Palestine. The \ndegree to which its intentions match its rhetoric is disputed. Most Israelis regard the \norganisation as fundamentalist and uncompromising, dedicated to killing Jews and \ndestroying the Israeli state. Two Israeli academics, Shaul Mishal and Avraharn Sela, \nsuggest that the organisation is more complex and pragmatic than this. They suggest \nthat Hamas utilizes 'controlled violence' as a 'means rather than an end' to mobilize \npolitical support and is 'cognizant of power relations and political feasibility' (2000: \n108 \nviii). Mishal and Sela argue that its main purpose has been to establish itself as the \nmajor force in Palestinian political life and that in the future it 'may find that it can \naccept a workable fon-nula of coexistence with Israel in place of armed struggle\" \n(2000: ix). In 1989 the groups' founder Sheik Yassin was arrested by Israel, and in the \noccupied territories the Israelis increased their use of deportations and curfews in an \nattempt to suppress the Intifada. They also outlawed the committees administering the \nuprising. This was a problem for Palestinians as they saw the committees as the \nnucleus of the self-governing institutions they hoped to build once the occupation \nended. \nIn 1989 Yitzak Shamir put forward an initiative which proposed elections and \nexpanded Palestinian autonomy in exchange for the ending of the Intifada. Shamir set \ndown certain preconditions, there would be no Palestinian state, no PLO involvement \n(even if its representatives triumphed in the elections) and no participation in the \nelections for the inhabitants of East Jerusalem. The plans were eventually derailed by \nmembers of Shamir's own cabinet, principly Ariel Sharon, David Levy, and Yitzhak \nModa'i who argued that Israel was giving too much away, and was adopting too \nliberal an attitude to the Intifada (Shlaim, 2000). Egypt and the United States then put \nforward their own peace initiatives. These precipitated a split in what was then a \nNational Unity government in Israel \n, \nwhich led to its downfall. One part of the \ngovernment, the Labour Alignment, unsuccessfully urged Shamir to accept the \nAmerican initiative, whilst some members of the right wing Likud party, felt Israel \nwas making too many concessions and not cracking down sufficiently hard on the \nIntifada. For six weeks the Labor party's Shimon Peres tried unsuccessfully to form a \nnew coalition, and eventually Yitzak Shamir formed one in which his Likud part \nlinked up with ultranationalist and religious parties. This new coalition which Shlaim \n(2000) claims was the most right wing and hardline (in its attitudes to the Arabs) in \nIsrael's history, immediately announced that it would end the Intifada, create new \nsettlements and expand existing ones. It also insisted there would be no Palestinian \nstate, no negotiation with the PLO and no sharing of Jerusalem. \nThe Intifada which continued to smoulder during this period, was re-ignited in \nOctober 1990 when Israeli troops killed 21 Palestinians on the Temple Mount in \nJerusalem. The Israelis claimed they had responded to acts of stone throwing directed \nat Israeli worshippers. The Palestinians claimed that the stone throwing only began \nafter the Israelis started shooting. The United Nations Security Council condemned \n109 \nthe killings, but Israel managed to prevent the United Nations from acting on \nPalestinian demands to replace the Israeli military government in the occupied \nterritories with a UN force (Ovendale, 1999). \nIn August 1990 the Iraq war intervened when Saddam Hussein invaded \nKuwait and occupied the country. Five months later an American led coalition \nattacked Iraq forcing its withdrawal from Kuwait. Both the Palestinians in the \noccupied territories and the PLO leadership allied themselves with Saddarn \nHussein because of the Iraqi dictator's attempt to make a 'linkage' between \nIraqi withdrawal from Kuwait and Israeli withdrawal from the occupied \nterritories, and because he struck at the Israeli state with scud missiles. In \ndoing so the Palestinian leadership effectively lost much of the political capital \nit had built up over many years, whilst Israel benefited internationally by not \nresponding to the Iraqi attacks. In the aftermath of the war the US moved to \nbring Israel and its Arab adversaries together in an international Peace \nconference. \nThe Beginning of the Oslo Process \nIn Madrid at the end of October 1991 an Israeli delegation met Palestinian and \nother representatives from Israel's 'confrontation states' (Syria, Jordan, Lebanon). \nAlthough the Palestinian representatives were pro-PLO, they were not publicly stated \nas being members of the organisation, as this would have landed them in jail under \nIsraeli law. The Americans who set up the conference insisted that it be based around \nUN Resolutions 242 and 338 and the principle of 'land for peace'. This premise was \naccepted by the Palestinians but rejected by the Israelis (Shlaim, 2000). In the run up \nto the conference the Likud administration announced a new wave of settlement \nbuilding designed to double the settler population in the occupied territories in four \nyears. Little progress was made in negotiations either at Madrid or in the five rounds \nof bilateral talks which took place in Washington. Shlaim argues that an 'immense \ngap' separated the parties: \n110 \nThe Palestinians started with the assumption that they were a people with \nnational rights and that the interim arrangements under discussion were the \nprecursor to independence and should be shaped accordingly. The Israeli \ngovernment started with the assumption that the Palestinians were the \ninhabitants of the territories with no national rights of any kind and certainly \nno rights to independence, not even after the end of the transitional period. \n(2000: 493) \nIn June 1992 the Israeli population went to the polls to elect a new \nadministration. The Likud party pledged to continue the peace process whilst \nretaining all the occupied territories and expanding settlement building. The Labor \nparty vowed to conclude a deal on Palestinian autonomy, allow residents of East \nJerusalem in take part in negotiations and freeze the construction of the 'political \nsettlements' deep in the occupied territory. Labor won the election under Yitzak \nRabin in a major political swing which ended fifteen years of Likud rule. In an Israeli \nnewspaper interview just after his election defeat Shamir declared that 'I would have \ncarried on autonomy talks for ten years, and meanwhile we would have reached half a \nmillion people in Judea and Samaria' (Maariv, 26 June 1992) \nOver the next 20 months Israeli and Palestinians sympathetic to but not \nmembers of the PLO, engaged in 10 rounds of negotiations in Washington that \nproduced no tangible results. In the middle of those negotiations Rabin deported 416 \nHamas activists to Lebanon following the killing of an Israeli border policeman. This \nmove, which was condemned by the UN as a breach of international law, was \nintended to curb Hamas's influence but actually had the opposite effect. Mishal and \nSela argue that the deportations were a 'milestone in Hamas's decision to use car \nbombs and suicide attacks as a major modus operandi against Israel', because they \ncame into contact with Hezbollah guerrillas who provided training in such techniques. \n(2000: 65-6), They note that Hamas first used suicide attacks shortly after the return \nof the deportees to the occupied territories. 38 \nIII \nThe Declaration of PrinciDles \nWhile the official negotiations continued the Israelis decided to open up a second and \nsecret channel of diplomacy in Oslo. For the first time they agreed to negotiate with a \nsection of the PLO. These talks bypassed the bulk of the PLO and Fatah, with \nnegotiations directed only towards Yasser Arafat and a few close associates. In \nSeptember 1993 the Declaration of Principles between the Palestinians and Israel was \nfinally brought into the open and signed by both parties on the White House lawn. \nThe Declaration was an agenda for negotiations which stipulated that within four \nmonths of signing the agreement Israel had to withdraw completely from Gaza and \nJericho, with a Palestinian police force taking over internal security in those areas, \nthough Israel would still maintain overall responsibility for external security and \nforeign affairs. Elsewhere in the West Bank Palestinians were to take control of five \nspheres: education, health, social welfare, direct taxation and tourism. Within nine \nmonths elections were to be held for a Palestinian Authority which was to assume \nresponsibilities for those municipal affairs. Final status negotiations were scheduled to \nstart within two years and were due to be completed within five years. All of the most \nserious issues affecting the two parties including possible Palestinian statehood, \nborders, refugees, settlements and Jerusalem were postponed to the final settlement \ntalks. The PLO agreed to accept UN resolutions 242 and 338, end the armed struggle \nagainst Israel and amend the parts of the Palestinian National Charter which called the \ndestruction of the Israeli state. Israel agreed to recognise the PLO as the representative \nof the Palestinian people. The Declaration of Principles brought to an end to the first \nIntifada which according to the Ahe Israeli human rights group B'Tselem had seen \n160 Israelis and 1,162 Palestinians killed (B'Tselem, 2003a). \nThe treaty met with opposition on both Israeli and Palestinian sides. Likud and \nthe right wing nationalist and religious parties denounced the agreement as a betrayal \nof the settlers in the occupied territories, an end to Biblical Greater Israel, and a \nmortal threat to the security of the State. They argued that the occupied territories \ncould not be ceded by politicians as they had been eternally promised to the Jews by \nGod. Binyamin Netanyahu, the Likud leader completely rejected the accord and \npledged to cancel it if he became Prime Minister. He compared the agreement to the \n112 \nappeasement of Hitler and told Peres, 'You are even worse than Chamberlain. He \nimperilled the safety of another people, but you are doing it to your own people' \n(cited in Shlaim, 2000: 521). The accord was eventually approved by the Knesset by a \nmargin of 61 votes to 50. Israeli public opinion on the accords was generally \nfavourable with 65% saying they approved of the agreement and only 13% declaring \nthemselves 'very much against' it (Shlaim, 2000). In an analysis of Palestinian \nreaction to the Oslo Accords, Mouin Rabbani identified four distinct positions and \nargued that 'contrary to most press reports the fault line \n.... \nwithin the Palestinian body \npolitic is not an ideological one separating peace-loving moderates from violent \nextremists' but rather one which revolves 'primarily around issues of substance and \nprocedure' (Middle East International, 24 September 1993). He claimed that only a \nfew Palestinians were 'enthusiastic supporters', with a majority whom he \ncharacterised as 'optimistic and desperate in equal measure' had serious doubts but \nwere prepared to give the agreement a chance. He suggested that this large group \ncould quickly turn against the agreement if the human rights situation did not \nimprove, and the settlement activity and occupation continued. The third group, he \nidentified, comprised senior political and cultural figures 39 such as Edward Said, who \nalthough supporting a peaceful resolution of the conflict, nevertheless regarded the \naccords as a 'deeply flawed' and 'potentially fatal to Palestinian national aspirations'. \nThey objected to Arafat signing the document without public debate or consultations \nand believed it was a bad deal. They pointed out the Palestinians were agreeing to end \nthe Intifada and renounce their rights to 78 per cent of historic Palestine without any \nguarantee of statehood, agreement to remove settlements (or even stop settlement \nbuilding), and any commitments to improve the human rights situation, or to resolve \nthe refugee issue and status of Jerusalem. For this group the agreement undermined \nthe internationally recognised rights of Palestinians and 'foreshadows permanent \ndispossession of the majority of Palestinians' as well as creating the potential \nconditions for a civil war. The fourth position that Rabbani identifies is that of the \nrejectionists who comprise both the radical Islamic and secular movements such as \nHarnas and the PFLP, and their supporters in the occupied territories. These groups, \nargues Rabbani, regarded the agreement as a 'textbook case of Bantustanisation' in \nwhich the principal Palestinian weapon the Intifada was being liquidated so that \nPalestinians could become the joint administrators of the occupation, in a weak \nsubservient statelet or series of statelets. Rabbani suggests that had the agreement \n113 \ninvolved moves towards real statehood and been reached in 'conformity with the \nPalestinian national consensus and properly ratified' then much of the rejectionist \ncamp with the exception of Islamic Jihad and sections of Hamas and the PFLP would \nat least have tacitly accepted the deal. \nThe 1993 Declaration of Principles was followed in February 1994 by the \nsigning of the new set of documents in Cairo. The IDF agreed to redeploy its forces \nfrom urban centres to rural areas allowing it to maintain control of overall security \nand land crossings. On 25 February Dr Baruch Goldstein, an American born settler \nand member of the Kach party opened fire with an IDF issued Galil assault rifle on \nMuslim worshipers at the Tomb of the Patriarchs in Hebron killing 29 people before \nhe himself was killed. Rachelle Marshall, aj oumalist and member of the Jewish \nPeace Union, writes that the killings were followed by five week round the clock \ncurfew imposed on more than a million Palestinians, during which the IDF killed a \nfurther 76 Palestinians, mostly stone throwing youths (Washington Report on Middle \nEast Affairs, June, 1994). The Israeli journalist Danny Rubenstein was later to argue \nthat the Hebron killings 'directly and immediately created the chain of suicide \nbombings and the appalling upward spiral composed of Israeli responses and \nPalestinian counter-responses' (Haaretz, 28 September 1998). In the wake of these \nevents Israeli government under pressure from the Palestinians and sections of Israeli \npublic opinion moved to outlaw the overtly racist party Kach, but refused Palestinian \ndemands to remove the few hundred heavily armed and guarded settlers who lived \namong more than 100,000 Palestinian Hebronites. The Israeli government also \nreftised PLO requests to put the issue of settlements on the negotiating table, arguing \nthat under the Declaration of Principles it was not obliged to do so until the third year \nof the interim period. Hamas vowed revenge for the Hebron killings, and shortly \nbefore the signing of the next stage of the interim agreements in Cairo in May 1994 it \ncarried out a car bombing in Afula which killed eight, and the first ever suicide \nbombing in Israel which killed five people. Suicide bombings involved individuals \nstrapping explosives, nails, and ball bearing to their bodies which were then detonated \nin densely packed areas such as markets or buses. This new and indiscriminate \nweapon left those who survived permanently scarred or disabled, and significantly \nintensified security fears amongst Israelis. A report from a BBC] News bulletin \ndescribes the aftermath of a suicide attack on a crowded Israeli market: \n114 \nThe two explosions came within seconds of each other cutting down scores of \npeople in the heart of the crowded market. It was just after one o'clock and the \nmarket was full of shoppers. Streams of ambulances came to carry away the \ndead and the injured. It was a place of appalling suffering \n... \nThose who \nescaped injury were led away from the devastation and others arrived \ndesperate to see if their friends and relatives had escaped the carnage. (BBC I \nEvening News, 30 July 1997) \nSome Palestinians have tried to justify such attacks by arguing that they are in \nresponse to the killing of Palestinian civilians by Israelis. Others have argued that they \nare resisting an illegal occupation, or that it is the only effective weapon against a \nmuch more powerful adversary. Dr Eyad EI-Sarraj, a psychiatrist and winner of the \n1998 Martin Ennals human rights award, has noted that most suicide bombers had \nsuffered a severe trauma when young, 'often the torture of a close relative' and that \n'children grow up wanting to take revenge for their trauma. Torture is an integral part \nof that cycle of violence' (Guardian, 24 January 2003). Whatever the motivations or \nfactors behind suicide bombings Human Rights groups have unequivocally \ncondemned such attacks and demanded that those involved in planning attacks be \nbrought to justice. In a report entitled Without Distinction: Attacks on civilians by \nPalestinian armed groups, Amnesty International, argue that indiscriminate attacks on \ncivilians cannot be justified whatever the circumstances or provocations: \nThe obligation to protect civilians is absolute and cannot be set aside because \nIsrael has failed to respect its obligations. The attacks against civilians by \nPalestinian armed groups are widespread, systematic and in pursuit of an \nexplicit policy to attack civilians. They therefore constitute crimes against \nhumanity under international law. They may also constitute war crimes, \ndepending on the legal characterisation of the hostilities and interpretation of \nthe status of Palestinian armed groups and fighters under international \nhumanitarian law. (Amnesty International, 2002) \n115 \nThe Cairo Agreement and slo 11 \nThe agreement signed in Cairo on 4 May 1994 concluded the Gaza and Jericho phase \nof the redeployment and set the terms for expanding Palestinian autonomy in the West \nBank. These had three stages. Firstly the Palestinian National Authority was to take \ncharge of a number of municipal functions secondly the IDF would withdraw from \npopulation centres and finally there would be Palestinian elections for a new \nauthority. However Palestinian negotiators were disappointed with the new \nagreement. They had hoped that Israel would replace the complex system of military \nordinances and occupation laws, with the Fourth Geneva Convention and \ninternational law within the occupied territories, but this was not forthcoming \n(Shlaim, 2000). The United Nations Commission on Human Rights continued to be \ncritical of Israeli human rights abuses in the occupied territories. In 1994 it issued a \nresolution 'condemning' settler and IDF killings, torture, imprisonment without trial, \nhouse demolitions and land expropriations, curfews, collective punishments, \nrestrictions on movement and settlement building (United Nations, 1994). \nThe construction of illegal Jewish settlements had accelerated following the \nelection of the Rabin administration in 1992. Between 1992 and 1995 the settler \npopulation in the occupied territories (excluding East Jerusalem) rose from 74,800 to \n136,000 (Foundationfor Middle East Peace, 1997). Palestinians believed that \nincreased settlement building and expropriations of Palestinian land was a violation of \nthe spirit if not the letter of the Oslo Accords, and would ultimately prejudice the \npossibility of a viable Palestinian state. The American historian and Middle East \ncommentator, Geoffrey Aronson argued that 'there is no missing the fact that Rabin's \nsettlement drive is aimed at putting the future of the city [Jerusalem] and its West \nBank environs beyond the reach of diplornacy. '(Report on Israeli Settlement in the \nOccupied Territory, May 1995) He also cited statements from the Israeli commentator \nZe'ev Schiff that 'when we come to the final stage [of negotiations] nothing will be \nleft [in Jerusalem] for the Palestinians to negotiate, apart from the Islamic holy \nplaces. ' Rabin's administration also embarked on a process of building bypass roads \nlinking settlements which could only be used by Jewish settlers and the IDF. This \nplan, Israel Shahak (1995) claimed was originally conceived by Ariel Sharon in 1977 \nbut was finally implemented by Rabin directly after the Declaration of Principles. He \nargued that its purpose was to create a matrix of control whereby all the Arab \n116 \npopulation centres were split into enclaves criss-crossed by the roads and settlement \nblocks so that the Israeli army will be able to control the discontinuous cantons 'from \noutside'. Tel-Aviv University professor Tanya Reinhart, argued that Rabin's policies \n'resemble[d] the beginning of Apartheid rather than its end' and were 4almost \nidentical' to the South African Bantustan model (Haaretz, 27 May 1994). The \nconstruction of the bypass road network also allowed the Israeli government to \nenforce closures on the Palestinian areas which restricted Palestinian movement and \naccess to employment. Israel justified such measures by arguing that it was necessary \nto prevent attacks by Palestinian militants against Israelis. It did however have very \nserious effects on the Palestinian economy. The Israeli journalist Nadav Ha'etzni \nreported that by May 1995 that curfews and closures had 'devastated the Palestinian \neconomy and destroyed 100,000 families in Gaza alone' (Maariv, 5 May 1995, cited \nin Chomsky, 1999: 548). The deteriorating economic situation for Palestinians was \ncompounded by Israeli moves to achieve 'separation' by replacing Palestinian \nworkers with migrant labour from Thailand, the Philippines, Romania and other parts \nof Eastern Europe. Such factors Shlaim suggests 'actually worsened the situation in \nthe occupied territories and confounded Palestinian aspirations for a state of their \nown. ' (2000: 530). Furthermore there was no halt to the bloodshed on both sides. \nBetween the signing of the Declaration of Principles in September 1993 and the end \nof 1994,93 Israelis and 194 Palestinians were killed in violent incidents (B'Tselem, \n2003) \nIn late September 1995 Yasser Arafat and Yitzak Rabin concluded the next \nstage of the interim agreement under which the West Bank was divided into three \nareas. Area A, (3 per cent of the West Bank incorporating Nablus, Jenin, Tulkarem, \nQalqilya, Ramallah, Bethlehem and subsequently, in January 1997,80 per cent of \nHebron) would have its civilian administration and internal security controlled by the \nPalestinian Authority. Area B (23 per cent of the West Bank comprising 440 villages \nand surrounding lands) was to have certain municipal functions administered by the \nPalestinian Authority whilst security would be dealt with by joint Palestinian-Israeli \npatrols. Area C (comprising 74 per cent of the West Bank, including all of the 145 \nsettlements and the new Jewish neighbourhoods in and around East Jerusalem) would \nremain under complete Israeli control. \n117 \nOn November 4 1995 Yitzak Rabin was assassinated by a 25 year old settler, \nYigal Amir. After the killing the unrepentant Amir accused Rabin of selling out the \nsettlers and preparing to give away the occupied territories to the Palestinians. Rabin \nwas succeeded as Prime Minister by Shimon Peres who pledged to maintain the \nmomentum of the peace process. No Israelis had been killed in suicide attacks since \nthe August 21 bombing in Jerusalem which had killed three Israelis and an American. \nMishal and Sela (2000) suggest that both Hamas and Islamic Jihad were under \npressure from both the Palestinian Authority and Israel, and did not want to \nantagonise Palestinian public opinion by precipitating a halt to the scheduled Israeli \nredeployments. Mishal and Sela also note that militant groups had been pushing for \nýa conditional cease-fire with Israel to stop the bloodshed of innocents on both sides' \n(2000: 7 1). In early 1996 Peres ordered the killing of Yahya Ayyash, a Hamas leader \nwho had previously masterminded several suicide attacks which had killed \napproximately 60 Israelis. Shlaim claims that the Israeli media had exaggerated his \nstatus presenting him as 'public enemy number one' whilst 'omitting to mention that \nthe attacks he organized came as a response to the [Hebron] massacre. ' (2000: 556) \nThe assassination of Ayyash using a booby trapped phone led to Hamas vowing \nrevenge and there followed six suicide bombings in February and March 1996 which \nleft 62 Israelis dead (Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 1999). Peres's popularity \ndeclined under attacks from the right, and he moved to suspend talks with the newly \nelected Palestinian Authority and closed the borders to all workers from the occupied \nterritories. \nShortly afterwards Peres launched a major offensive against Hezbollah \nguerrillas in Southern Lebanon. Israel had been fighting a long guerrilla war against \nHezbollah militants. Hezbollah claimed they were trying to end the illegal Israeli \noccupation of Southern Lebanon, which had been ongoing since 1978, in violation of \n40 United Security Council resolution 425 \n. \nIsrael claimed that Hezbollah were intent on \nthe destruction of the Israeli state. Casualty statistics suggest that Palestinian and \nLebanese civilians had suffered disproportionately in the conflict. In the period \nbetween 1985 and 1996 the Israeli army estimate that Hezbollah guerrilla and rocket \nattacks had killed six Israeli civilians (Israeli Defence Force, 2003). In a single \noperation in 1993 Amnesty International (I 996a) reported that Israel killed 118 \nLebanese civilians and that 300,000 people were displaced. The journalist and former \nchief inspector of the US Information Agency, Richard Curtiss argues that after this \n118 \noperation, unwritten rules of engagement were crafted by the US State Department's \nWarren Christopher with both sides agreeing to confine attacks to combatants in \nSouth Lebanon (Washington Report on Middle East Affairs, May/June 1996). On \nApril 11 1996 Peres launched Operation 'Grapes of Wrath'. This was claimed to be in \nretaliation for rocket strikes on Israeli settlements which had injured 34 civilians, and \nother attacks which had killed eight members of the IDF in Southern Lebanon. \nHezbollah's view was that they had a right to resist the Israeli troops illegally \noccupying Southern Lebanon, and that the rockets fired on Israeli settlements were \nretaliation for the killing by Israel of three Lebanese civilians. The attack involved \nmore than a thousand air sorties and 16,000 shells against less than 500 Hezbollah \nfighters (Haaretz, 21 May 1996). Curtiss claims that many of attacks were 'targeted \nat electric power plants and relay stations, bridges, and other parts of Lebanon's war\u0002battered basic infrastructure' (Washington Report on Middle East Affairs, May/June \n1996). The Israeli journalist Avi Shavit alleges that 400,000 civilians were forced to \nflee their homes in eight hours, after which the Israeli airforce treated the abandoned \nproperties as military targets and shelled them (Haaretz, 21 May 1996). On 18 April \nIsrael bombed the United Nations Compound at Qana, killing 106 refugees who had \nsought sanctuary there. Israel stated that the bombing which involved anti-personnel \nmunitions was a mistake and that the real target was an area nearby where Hezbollah \nmilitants had been operating. Both a UN (1996) and Amnesty (I 996b) report found \nthat the attack on the UN compound was unlikely to have been accidental, and also \ncondemned Israeli missile attacks on ambulances and residential areas which killed \nmany civilians. Shlaim suggests that the operation was an attempt by Shimon Peres to \nrevive his flagging political fortunes and recast himself 'as the hard man of Israeli \npolitics ahead of the crucial general elections' (2000: 560). However it did nothing to \nrevive his political fortunes and the following month he was beaten in the General \nelection by the Likud candidate Ben iamin Netanyahu. \nThe Netanvahu. Administration \nNetanyahu's attitude towards the peace process before his election had been \none of undisguised antipathy. He had campaigned publicly against its implementation \nin speeches and in print, and had been accused by Rabin's widow of inciting his \n119 \nassassination by making inflammatory public speeches, which likened Rabin to an SS \nofficer. His coalition included the far right and settler groups who called for the \nforced deportation of all Palestinians from the occupied territories. Netanyahu's \ncentral argument was that the peace process had illustrated Israel's weakness, reduced \nthe deterrent power of the IDF and damaged the nation's security. He argued that \nIsrael had adhered to the Oslo formula whilst the Palestinians had failed to keep their \nside of the bargain, by failing to dismantle militant organisations, collect their \nweapons or extradite their members to Israel. Netanyahu's alternative was to \nrenegotiate the redeployments that had been agreed in principle. He argued that these \nthreatened Israel's security and that 'whatever the officials of the previous Labor \nadministration had whispered in Palestinian ears was irrelevant' (Netanyahu, 2000: \n343). He was also against full statehood for the Palestinians, arguing that Israel had to \ncontrol the exit and entry points to the Palestinian entity as well as its airspace, much \nof the Jordan valley and the West Bank water supply. He also argued that Arab \nnations should resettle the Palestinian refugees. Shlaim claims that as soon as he took \npower Netanyahu began to renege on Israel's Oslo obligations: \nSerious deterioration occurred in Israel's relations with the Palestinians as a \nresult of Netanyahu's backtracking. He adopted a 'work-to-rule' approach \ndesigned to undermine the Oslo process. There was no Israeli pullout from \nHebron, no 'opening of the safe passage' route from Gaza to the West Bank, \nand no discussion of the further West bank redeployment that Israel had \npledged to carry out in early September. Instead Palestinian homes without an \nIsraeli permit were demolished in east Jerusalem, and plans were approved for \nthe construction of new Israeli settlements. The quality of life for the \nPalestinians deteriorated progressively, and hopes for a better future were all \nbut extinguished (2000: 576) \nIn October 1996 serious violence erupted in Jerusalem when Netanyahu \nordered the blasting open an archaeological tunnel close to the al-Aksa Mosque. This \nwas taken by Palestinians as a statement of sovereignty over Islamic holy sites and \ntriggered disturbances in which 15 Israeli soldiers and 80 Palestinians were killed, and \na further 1500 Palestinians wounded. Under pressure from the Americans Netanyahu \nagreed to the delayed redeployment of Israeli troops from Hebron in January 1997 by \n120 \nsigning the Hebron protocol, which also committed Israel to three further \nredeployments in the West bank over the next 18 months. Under the agreement \nHebron was split into Jewish and Arab zones. The Jewish zone reserved for the 450 \nsettlers constituted 20% of the city, including its best commercial areas. The \nremaining 80% of the city was reserved for the 130,000 Palestinian Hebronites who \nwere subject to frequent curfews and restrictions on movement. \nAfter the signing of the Hebron protocol Netanyahu approved a number of \nnew settlements. In February 1997 he announced plans for 6,500 new dwellings for \n30,000 settlers at Jabal Ghneim (Har Homa) on the outskirts of annexed East \nJerusalem. Har Homa would complete the chain of concentric settlements around \nJerusalem and cut off Arab East Jerusalem from the rest of the West Bank. The move \nwas met with anger from Palestinians and condemned by the United Nations (1997) \nGeneral Assembly by 130 votes to two (Israel, United States). Palestinians were \nunhappy with more expropriation of their land and called a general strike in protest. \nThe US twice vetoed Security Council resolutions condemning the project, whilst the \nGeneral Assembly passed further resolutions calling for a halt to the Har Homa \nproject, the removal of settlements in the occupied territories, and the application of \nthe Fourth Geneva Convention within the territories. None of these moves stopped the \nconstruction of the new settlements. In June 1997 the Israeli journalist Jay Bushinsky \nreported that Netanyahu had outlined his 'Allon plus' plan for a possible settlement \nwith the Palestinians. The plan involved Israel annexing approximately 60% of the \nWest Bank that would include Greater Jerusalem, the hills east of Jerusalem, the \nJordan valley, the settlements and all the bypass roads connecting them, plus \npermanent Israeli control of the West Bank water supply (Jerusalem Post, 5 June \n1997). The proposals were met with dismay by Palestinian leaders who accused Israel \nof violating the Oslo Accords and trying to destroy the peace process. \nAlthough the conflict between Palestinian fighters and the IDF and settlers in \nthe occupied territories continued to claim more lives, there were no suicide attacks in \nIsrael between March 1996 and March 1997. Between March 21 1997 and September \n4 1997 militants carried out three suicide attacks killing 24 Israelis. Hamas \nrepresentatives argued that the attacks were the only way to stop the expropriation of \nmore Palestinian land for settlement building and the 'Judaization' of the Holy places. \nOn September 23 1997 the Hamas leadership sent a letter to Netanyahu, delivered by \nKing Hussein of Jordan, in which Hamas suggested setting up an indirect dialogue \n121 \nwith the Israeli government, that would be mediated by King Hussein. The purpose of \nthe dialogue would be achieve a cessation of violence as well as a 'discussion of all \nmatters' (Ha'aretz, 9 October 1997, cited in Sela & Avraham, 2000: 72). Two days \nlater Netanyahu ordered the killing of the head of Hamas's Political Bureau, Khalid \nMash'al in Jordan. The attempted assassination by two Mossad agents was botched \nand Mash'al's bodyguard captured the two assassins who were later traded for the \nimprisoned Hamas spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin. The attempted killing \nsoured relations with King Hussein, Israel's closest ally in the Arab world and ended \nany opportunity for a cease-fire. The release of Yassin followed by his return to Gaza \nstrengthened Hamas's support. \nIn March 1998 1,500 reservists included twelve retired major-generals called \non Netanyahu to stop settlement building and try to end the conflict and normalise \nrelations. (Shlaim, 2000). However Netanyahu cancelled the scheduled Israeli \nredeployments, citing security concerns. Despite efforts by both Britain and the US to \nrevive the process it ground to a halt. Both sides in the conflict accused the other of \nbad faith in reneging on their Oslo obligations. Netanyahu reiterated his claims that \nthe PLO had failed to disarm or arrest militant groups, prevent attacks against Israelis, \nand amend the PLO charter. Others contested this. Tanya Reinhart writing in the \nIsraeli publication Tikkun claimed that Arafat had taken strong action against Hamas \nand that this was recognised by Israel's security services: \nArafat's security services carried out this job [maintaining Israeli security] \nfaithfully, by assassinating Hamas terrorists (disguised as \"accidents\"), and \narresting Hamas political leaders \n... \nAmple information was published in the \nIsraeli media regarding these activities, and 'security sources' were full of \npraises for Arafat's achievements. For example, Ami Ayalon, then head of the \nIsraeli secret service (Shabak), announced, in a government meeting on April \n5,1998 that \"Arafat is doing his job-he is fighting terror and puts all his \nweight against the Hamas\" (Haaretz, April 6 1998). The rate of success of the \nIsraeli security services in containing terror was never higher than that of \nArafat; in fact, it was probably much lower. (March/April 2002) \nIn a 1998 report, the Israeli peace group Gush Shalom (1998) blamed the \nNetanyahu administration for the breakdown in the peace process and accused the \n122 \ngovernment of 19 separate violations of the Oslo Accords including settlement and \nbypass road building, use of closures, failure to release Palestinian prisoners, torture \nand other human rights abuses, and failure to undertake scheduled military \nwithdrawals and move towards final status negotiations. During this period support \nfor militant organisations such as Islamic Rhad and Hamas grew whilst the PLO and \nparticularly Yasser Arafat lost popularity. Partly this was because of corruption \nscandals that engulfed the PLO leadership which was accused of nepotism and \nsiphoning off funds meant for the Palestinian Authority. It was also because of \nArafat's autocratic style and the serious human rights abuses committed by the \nPalestinian security forces who were using torture and engaging in extra-judicial \nkillings against opponents of the Oslo process. There was also widespread anger that \nArafat had failed to stop settlement building. Geoffrey Aronson claimed that Arafat \nand the other PLO 'outsiders' (those from outside the occupied territories) failed to \nappreciate the significance of the settlements: \nPA chairman Yasser Arafat is briefed infrequently on Israel's settlement \npolicy, and his response is generally stunned silence as he looks at the maps \ndepicting the dimensions of the enterprise. Palestinian Authority negotiators \nMahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) and Ahmad Quray (Abu Ala) have never been \non a4 settlement tour. ' If one is to judge by their negotiating priorities, they \nhave no concept of the role of settlements in the history of Israel's policies in \nthe occupied territories, nor do they believe that such an understanding is \nrequired. (Report on Israeli Settlement in the Occupied Territories, \nJuly/August 1998) \nIn October 1998 Israel and Palestinian negotiators met at Wye River \nPlantation to negotiate on the next phase of the Oslo process. This brings to an end the \nhistorical review of the conflict, which has illustrated the extraordinary range of \nviewpoints on the history of the conflict. In the next chapter I will examine how \njournalists have drawn from these perspectives in their reporting of the conflict. \n123 \nChapter 3 Content Analysis of the Wye Accords \nIntroduction \nThis content analysis examines how television news covered the Wye Peace summit \nwhich took place in America in October 1998. The summit which involved Israeli and \nPalestinian delegations meeting in an attempt to further the Oslo peace process, was \npresided over by the American president Bill Clinton. It was widely accepted by all \nparties that the peace process, which had been inaugurated five years previously by \nYitzak Rabin and Yasser Arafat signing the Declaration of Principles on the White \nHouse lawn, was encountering some problems. The process had ground to a halt, with \nIsrael refusing to carry out the troop withdrawals scheduled in the previous \nagreements. The reasons for the breakdown were contested. The Netanyahu \ngovernment argued that the Palestinians had failed to adhere to their commitments \nunder the Oslo agreements by not curbing incitement, preventing attacks against \nIsraelis or arresting Palestinians suspected of involvement in attacks. Some prominent \nIsraelis disputed this. For instance Ami Ayalon, the head of the Israeli secret service \n(Shabak) had praised Arafat for his attempts to rein in Hamas activists (Ha'aretz, \nApril 6 1998). Far right parties and religious settler groups who were part of \nNetanyahu's coalition government favoured withdrawing from the peace process \ncompletely. They argued that the occupied territories were part of biblical Israel, \npromised to the Jews by God, and should not be returned to the Palestinians in \nexchange for peace. Palestinians were sceptical of the Israeli government's \ncommitment to the peace process and noted that Binyamin Netanyahu had been a \nvocal critic of the Oslo process and its 'land for peace' formula. They pointed to \nincreased expropriations of Palestinian land, the demolition of thousands of \nPalestinian homes, and the creation of more illegal Israeli settlements. They were also \nangered that Israel had created a grid of military checkpoints and bypass roads across \nthe occupied territories, which severely limited their freedom of movement, and \nwhich had been likened to South Africa's pass laws (cited in Philo & Berry, 2004). \nMany Palestinians believed that the peace process was being manipulated to allow \nIsrael to take more and more occupied land, and feared that Yasser Arafat's \nPalestinian Authority could not be relied on to negotiate an equitable settlement. \nThe purpose of the content analysis is to examine the range of explanations \noffered to viewers during reporting of the peace conference. These explanations, \n124 \nwhich were contested by the opposing parties, related to various different aspects of \nthe conflict, and the moves towards a settlement. Some explanations referred to the \nhistorical origins of the conflict. Others focused on why the peace process had ground \nto a halt and who was to blame. There were also the differing perspectives on the \nissues which separated the parties, like settlements and the status of Jerusalem, as well \nas the factors which led some parties to oppose the peace process. The purpose is to \nascertain whether certain perspectives and explanations were highlighted in coverage \nand whether others were marginalized. It thus looked at questions of representation, \naccess and power. \nMethodolggy \nIn October 2002 Stephen Bates reported that the Israeli state had commissioned two \nof America's most renowned public relationships professionals in order to try and \nimprove Israel's public image and counter what was argued was a bias against Israel \nin the British media (Guardian 12 October 2002). Bates cited comments by Gidon \nMeir, the Israeli foreign ministry's deputy director for public affairs, who described \nthe Palestinian public relations strategy as a 'strategic threat'. Meir argued that the \n'Palestinians understand that one of the most important weapons in this conflict is a \ncamera \n... \nIn some places we are winning and in others we are losing and are engaged \nin damage control'. Meir is emphasizing the importance of the mass media as a site in \nthe struggle for public legitimacy. The winning of public consent in democratic \nsocieties is vital for the exercise of power and this is no less true in an international \ncontext. The ability to engineer that consent is partly dependent on the capacity to \nmake sure that a particular perspective or ideology becomes widely accepted. The \nmass media then serve as a site of conflict where various groups struggle to make sure \nthat their perspective predominates whilst that of the their rivals is marginalized. \nHowever this struggle does not take place on a level playing field. Some groups \nbecause of their place in the institutional structure of British political life, or ability to \naccess public relations resources have inbuilt advantages in making sure their \nperspective is heard. The methodology employed here, Thematic Analysis, examines \nhow competing viewpoints are covered (or excluded) by journalists in controversial \nareas of coverage. The methodology has been developed by the Glasgow Media \nGroup and applied to a number of different areas of news coverage such as industrial \n125 \nnews, war reporting and coverage of public health issues. In the mid 1970s the group \nexamined the coverage of British industrial news and in particular focused on the \ndiffering explanations put forward for Britain's declining industrial performance. \nWhilst business leaders and the Conservative party blamed the decline on the power \nof unions and the prevalence of strike action, the trade unions pointed to low levels of \ninvestment in plant and machinery which meant that workers in competing countries \nwere using more modem and efficient equipment. The group examined the published \nevidence which supported both positions and then examined which perspectives were \nhighlighted or downplayed in television news coverage. The group found that while \nthere was much coverage which blamed the decline on strike action and the behaviour \nof trade unions, there was none which linked it to low levels of investment or \nmanagement failings. They also suggested that once the explanation that 'strikes were \nto blame' became established in the news this then set the pattern and structure for \nfurther reporting. Journalists would visit factories and interview workers about strikes, \nbut not interview or question management about investment decisions. Thus the \npattern of coverage could implicitly assume the explanation that strikes were the \nculprit without actually having to state it explicitly. \nIn the previous chapters I reviewed how the historical record of the conflict \nhas been contested by Israelis and Palestinians. The purpose of this exercise was to \nlay out the range of views which exist on the conflict. In the content analysis, I want \nto examine how journalists have utilised elements of history of the conflict to \ncontextualise their coverage, and explain events. I begun by transcribing all news \ncoverage of the Wye Accords on all five terrestrial channels. In total 44 bulletins were \ntranscribed over six viewing days yielding 1417 lines of text. I then calculated the \namount of space give to different subject areas. The most prominent area of coverage \ndealt with the latest progress of negotiations and discussion of America's role in \nbrokering the conference, accounting for nearly half the coverage. This was followed \nby an examination of the range of explanations offered to viewers in relation to \nvarious aspects of the conflict. Some explanations related to the history and origins of \nthe conflict, others concerned the issues under discussion at the summit and a third \ncategory dealt with the final status issues, such as Jerusalem, which were at the heart \nof the conflict. This was followed by an analysis of howjournalists evaluated the \nhealth of the peace process and discussed those who opposed the process. Finally I \nexamined the access given to the Palestinian and Israeli sources, the quantity of space \n126 \ngiven to reported statements from both sides and the language used by j ournalists in \ntalking about the conflict. \nWhilst discussing the coverage I also reference audience research which \nexamined public understanding of the conflict. This research involved both \nquestionnaire and focus group methods. The focus groups consisted of seven to eight \npeople on average, who were brought together by a mediator to discuss various \naspects of the conflict. In total 100 people were involved in the focus groups who \nwere selected on the basis of income, age and gender. The questionnaire part of the \nstudy involved more than 700 students from Britain, America and Germany \nanswering questions about various aspects of the conflict. This research can be found \nin Philo and Berry (2004). \nTheme 1: Progress of talks/Movement of dignitaries/Discussion of America's role in \nthe Peace Process \nThis was by far the largest single aspect of the coverage accounting for 53 percent of \nthe total (753 lines out of 1417). Within this category was grouped all news coverage \nthat dealt with the movement of important dignitaries, the progress of peace \nnegotiations and discussion of America's role in brokering the conference. Any \nreferences to the issues being discussed or the history or causes of the conflict were \nnot included within this category. Much of the coverage consisted of updates on the \nprogress of talks, with extensive description of the latest developments. However \nthese reports on the progress of the talks were rarely accompanied by any in depth \ndiscussion of what was being negotiated or the factors underpinning the conflict. Here \nfor example is a news bulletin from ITN reproduced in its entirety: \nNewscaster: The West Bank Peace talks in America are on the brink of \ncollapse tonight with the Israelis saying they have their engines running and \nare ready to pull out. The negotiations have gone on longer than scheduled. \nPresident Clinton has been trying to nudge the two sides together. King \nHussein of Jordan left his sick bed to help. \n127 \nJournalist: The talks in this secluded mansion outside Washington were \nsupposed to last two days. That was seven days ago. In that time the \nPalestinian and Israeli leadership have been deadlocked unable to get the \npeace process that began in Oslo five years ago back on schedule. King \nHussein of Jordan has come from his sick bed in a Minnesota cancer clinic to \ntry and achieve a breakthrough, so far to no avail. President Clinton has made \nrepeated visits to negotiate with the leaders separately and together but he too \ncannot bridge the gap. Perhaps the most striking thing about these talks is the \namount of time the President has invested personally he has been here six days \nout of seven. It means that if they succeed they will be seen as a considerable \npersonal triumph but if they fail a serious setback for the prestige of American \ndiplomacy. And with the Israelis today threatening to pack up and go home \nfailure seems the most likely outcome. The State Department spokesman was \ntoday brutally realistic. \nUS State Department Spokesman: We can't hold people here against their will \nand we can't make them make the tough choices. This is their security \ninterests that are at stake, for both the Palestinians and the Israelis, their future \nthat is at stake and they have to make those decisions. \nJournalist: President Clinton is deciding now whether to make another visit to \nthe talks this evening. After seven days patience is running short. There may \nnot be much time left. (ITV, Evening News, 21 October 1998) \nTelevision news because of its format puts a premium on the latest updates \nand breaking news. However this emphasis on immediacy can marginalize \nexplanations that are necessary if viewers are to understand stories. There is nothing \nin the above broadcast, except the brief comment from an official US source that \n4 security interests... are at stake' that gives the viewing audience any clues as to what \nwas actually under discussion at the talks or what the conflict is about. Here is another \nreport this time from an early evening news bulletin on BBC 1: \nNewscaster: King Hussein of Jordan has flown from his hospital bed to join \nPresident Clinton's attempt to cajole the Middle East talks to some sort of \n128 \nagreement. The talks in Maryland have entered their sixth day with no sign of \na breakthrough. Meanwhile the armed wing of the militant Islamic movement \nHamas, has said that it carried out the grenade attack which brought the talks \nto the brink of collapse. And our Washington correspondent Stephen Sackur is \nat the talks in Maryland. Stephen, King Hussein is clearly very ill why is his \nintervention considered necessary? \nJournalist: The Americans believe that King Hussein could make the \ndifference between success and failure in this six day long summit. They \nbelieve that he is the one man who has the ear of both Benjamin Netanyahu, \nthe Israeli prime minister, and Yasser Arafat the Palestinian leader. And in \nparticular King Hussein is going to express fears, also expressed by President \nClinton that if no deal is done here in Maryland then the whole Middle East \ncould go into a series of conflicts and turmoil which would be very bad for the \nPalestinians, bad for the Israelis and bad for neighbours like King Hussein of \nJordan. So its going to be a clear message a simple message to both sides that \na deal must be done and it must be done now. \nNewscaster: Is yesterday's grenade attack still having an effect on the talks? \nJournalist: In a sense not so much. The Israelis yesterday in the immediate \naftermath of that attack in Beersheba in Israel said that they would talk about \nnothing in these negotiations except security. They suspended all other talks. \nWell today their position has shifted and I understand that is because of \nsubstantial American pressure. The Americans were frustrated that the Israelis \nwere allowing that terror attack to shift the whole nature of these talks there \nwere serious words between President Clinton and Benjamin Netanyahu about \nthat last night. And now all of the committees are doing their work I've just \nspoken to the State department spokesman who says that very hard bargaining \nis taking place and it does look as though in the words of the Americans we \nare reaching the end game in this long summit. (BBC 1, Early Evening News \n20 October 1998) \n129 \nIn this example there is a very brief mention that the Israeli delegation 'would talk \nabout nothing in these negotiations except security' but little information about the \nissues at the talks. The pronounced emphasis on the latest events and the role of \nimportant dignitaries, tends to crowd out explanations for the conflict which might \nhelp viewers understand the motivations and positions of the Israelis and Palestinians. \nAs will be discussed in more detail in the chapter dealing with production factors, this \nappears partly to be a function of the pressure to produce dramatic bulletins which \nwill maximise audiences. The former BBC correspondent Tim Llewelyn has spoken \nof the 'intense competitiveness' between news channels. News editors, he suggests, \n4 want stuff that has immediate impact, they don't want somebody explaining \nanything \n... \nthe competition, the bang bang aspect, the drama of news has overridden \neverything else' (Interview, 16 April 2004). In the above news bulletins there seems \nto be an attempt by j ournalists to inject drama into the proceedings at the expense of \nproducing more analytical coverage. Journalists' talk of the Israelis with their \n4engines running \n... \nready to pull out', the arrival of the cancer-striken King Hussein \nfrom his 'sick bed'. the 'striking' personal commitment of Bill Clinton and the danger \nthat 'the whole Middle East could go into a series of conflicts and turmoil' is \ndramatic. However other areas of coverage appeared to suggest that what was being \ndebated at the Summit was not as significant as the reports above indicated. For \ninstance an ITV correspondent later reported that an Israeli source had told him that \n'what has been negotiated over the past week are simply peanuts compared to the \nmajor issues that have yet to emerge in a final agreement' (ITV, lunchtime news, 23 \nOctober 1998). The essential point is that by devoting more than half of all coverage \nto latest developments, or descriptive accounts of America's role in negotiations this \nleaves less space to provide analysis of the conflict. As will be seen, vital aspects of \nthe dispute, necessary for a coherent understanding of the conflict were barely \nmentioned. \nThe role of the United States received a great deal of attention in reporting. \nComments about American diplomacy and in particular President Clinton's role \naccounted for 23 percent of all coverage (328 lines out of 1417). All comments \nregarding the role of the United States were extremely positive, arguing that President \nClinton had expended a great deal of effort in attempting to bring peace to the Middle \nEast and that if the summit failed it would be a 'serious setback' for American \ndiplomacy: \n130 \nPresident Clinton wants a Middle East peace agreement very badly perhaps \nmore than the Israelis and the Palestinians themselves. His extraordinary \ninvestment of time and prestige in this summit continued today, he went to \nMaryland with a familiar message. (BBC I Early Evening News, 22 October \n1998) \nIt took 20 hours of non-stop talks away from the TV cameras to clinch the \ndeal. President Clinton pressured Benjamin Netanyahu and Yasser Arafat \nthrough a series of last minute problems. Just after 3am local time the deal was \ndone. The Palestinians get more West Bank land the Israelis receive new \nsecurity commitments, the Americans will oversee the deal. (BBC I Early \nEvening News, 23 October 1998) \nPresident Clinton has made repeated visits to negotiate with the leaders \nseparately and together but he too cannot bridge the gap. Perhaps the most \nstriking thing about these talks is the amount of time the President has \ninvested personally he has been here six days out of seven. It means that if \nthey succeed they will be seen as a considerable personal triumph but if they \nfail a serious setback for the prestige of American diplomacy. (ITV Evening \nNews, 21 October 1998) \nWell it is a big deal for President Clinton and I would argue that President \nClinton needed this deal at this particular time more than either Mr Arafat or \nmore than Mr Netanyahu as well. He had invested so much time and prestige \nin this summit and in the effort to get this interim deal together that it would \nhave a terrible blow to his prestige and his international credibility if he failed. \nThere was a blazing row today I understand between the Israeli Prime Minister \nand Bill Clinton and it looked as though at the very last minute the Israelis \nmight withdraw from the deal because of a row over an Israeli spy in an \nAmerican jail. But Bill Clinton stood his ground he got through that and he \nwon a standing ovation tonight from all sides for his effort to make this work. \n(BBC2 Newsnight, 23 October 1998) \n131 \nThe clear message of the coverage appears to be that President Clinton is acting a \npeace broker, attempting to 'bridge the gap' between two bitter enemies. The \npresident is portrayed as having put an 'extraordinary investment of time and prestige' \ninto the peace process, having 'stood his ground' in the face of Israeli demands and \n4won a standing ovation tonight from all sides for his effort to make this work'. In one \nexchange between a BBC news anchor and a foreign correspondent it was suggested \nthat American pressure on Israel had been so great that it might threaten the \nrelationship between the two countries: \nCorrespondent: The Israelis say those security proposals are simply not \nenough and that the Palestinians are breaking promises, in this case you've got \nthe Palestinians and Americans on one side and the Israelis on the other. It \nmay be a situation in which the Israelis feel they have no option but to walk \nout. \nNews Anchor: And could we be looking here, briefly Stephen, at the \nbreakdown of a relationship between the United States and Israel. \nCorrespondent: Its to early to say that Peter, but I've just had James Rubin, the \nstate department spokesman, say that this is a key moment in the history of the \nMiddle East peace process. (BBC I evening news, 21 October 1998) \nFor Newsnight's David Sales the prerequisite for any further moves towards a \npeaceful solution was even more American involvement: \nIt will take a miracle for a permanently reluctant Netanyahu and a much \nweakened Arafat to bring about any final agreement on schedule given the \nblood, sweat, tears, and brinkmanship that have plagued even this week's \nmodest interim deal. The absolute must for any success will be for Mr Clinton \nto get down there in the trenches as he has done this past week. Without him \nnothing. (BBC2, Newsnight 23 October 1998) \nHowever a rather different image of the Clinton administration's position in \nthe conflict appeared in the Israeli press some time before the summit. Under the title \n132 \n'The Jews who run Clinton's Court' Maariv columnist Avinoam Bar-Yosef, spoke of \nthe 'enormous Jewish influence' within the Clinton administration manifested in the \nhigh proportion of Jews employed in the most senior and sensitive positions within \nthe government (2 September 1994). Bar-Yosef noted that 'in the National Security \nCouncil, 7 out of II top staffers are Jews' whom Clinton had placed 'in the most \nsensitive junctions in the U. S. security and foreign policy administrations'. He further \nmaintained that 'the situation is not much different in the president's office, which is \nfull of warm [pro-Israel] Jews' and the State Department which has a 'a long list of \nsenior Jewish officials' including many members of the pro-Israel lobby. Bar-Yosef \nalso noted that two members of the pro-Israel lobby, Dennis Ross and Martin Idnyk \nheaded the Clinton administration's Middle East policy team. Martin Idnyk was \npreviously a media consultant to the far right Israeli prime ministers Menachem Begin \nand Yitzak Shamir. He later became director of research for the leading pro-Israel \npressure group, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). AIPAC \nconsistently features in Fortune magazine's list of America's most influential lobby \ngroups and it's website states that 'the US must stand by its loyal ally, Israel, and not \nsubscribe to an unprincipled policy of 'even-handedness\" in its dealings with the \nIsrael-Palestine conflict (AIPAC, 2004). It has been suggested that AIPAC and the \nwider pro-Israel lobby create such political pressure that it is very difficult for \nAmerican administrations to take an objective stance on the conflict: \nAIPAC has a lot of influence on foreign policy. They work very hard to make \nsure that America endorses pretty much Israel's view of the world and the \nMiddle East. They do partly by convincing, partly by implied threats. AIPAC \ndoes not raise money for candidates but there are Jewish PACs (Political \nAction Committees) that raise campaign funds for candidates. Four or five \ntimes over the last twenty years, these PACs have gone after members of \nCongress who voted in ways that AIPAC didn't like. They have flooded their \nopponents with money and enabled them to beat the incumbents. Sent a \nmessage that if you really want to go against AIPAC, you'd better know where \nyour next dollar is coming from. So that, as I've been told by a number of \ncongressional aides over the last few years, if the congressman doesn't vote \nagainst Arafat, they'll pay a price. If they do vote against Arafat, there's no \nprice to be paid. There's no percentage for the member of Congress to stand \n133 \nup for peace, for compromise. Nobody is going to reward them they'll be \npunished. (A Lobby to Reckon With, BBC Radio 4,7 May 2002, cited in Philo \n& Berry, 2004: 253) \nThe Clinton administration provided more than three billion dollars worth of \nannual aid to Israel. Much of the funding was spent on military equipment, which was \nused against Palestinians. Some of the aid was also used for building illegal Israeli \nsettlements in the occupied territories (Said, 1996). The Clinton administration had \nalso provided diplomatic support for successive Israeli governments' illegal \nsettlement building programs. Palestinians believed that the creation of more \nsettlements was undercutting the peace process, because once these 'facts on the \nground', as some Israeli leaders had referred to the settlement blocks, were \nestablished, it was highly unlikely they would ever be returned in a peace agreement. \nThe United Nations had repeatedly criticized Israel's settlement drive, which it \ndescribed as an 'obstacle to peace'. The previous year when the Netanyahu \ngovernment began construction of a 6,500 unit settlement block in occupied East \nJerusalem, the General Assembly had condemned the move by 130 votes to 2 (Israel \nand the United States). When the issue moved to the Security Council the Clinton \nadministration twice vetoed resolutions condemning the settlement activity. It was not \ndifficult to find alternative voices which questioned what Clinton was actually \nsupporting under the banner of the Oslo process, even in the Israeli press. A week \nbefore the talks began, Edward Said wrote of the 'bankruptcy' of the Oslo process: \nIf the last few years have proved one thing, it is the bankruptcy of the vision \nproclaimed by Oslo, and of the leadership that engineered the whole wretched \nthing. It left huge numbers of Palestinians unrepresented, impoverished and \nforgotten; it allowed Israel to expropriate more land in addition to \nconsolidating its hold on Jerusalem, the Golan Heights, and the West Bank \nand Gaza settlements; it validated the notion of what can only be called petty \nPalestinian nationalism, which in reality was little more than a few wom-out \nslogans and the survival of the old PLO leadership \n... \nOslo, in my view, was a \nclever way for the Labor Party to create a series of Bantustans in which the \nPalestinians would be confined and dominated by Israel, at the same time \n134 \nhinting that a quasi-state for Palestinians would come into being. (Haaretz, II \nOctober 1998) \nLikewise Robert Fisk writing in the Independent after the talks was very critical of \nwhat had been agreed and America's role in the process: \nOslo and Wye destroyed any Palestinian hope for a just peace. Israel was \nallowed to build more Jewish settlements on Palestinian land, confiscate \nPalestinian identity papers, demolish Palestinian homes. And Arafat \n- \nfor \nperhaps 14 per cent of the land of 'Palestine' \n- \nhad to promise to protect the \nIsraelis who were building the settlements, confiscating the paper and \ndemolishing the homes. And they called it peace. (Independent, 16 December \n1998). \nThe views presented above represent a very different view of the American \nadministration than that presented to viewers. Many Palestinians did not believe that \nthe 'absolute must for any success [in the peace process] will be for Mr Clinton to get \ndown there in the trenches' (BBC2 Newsnight, 23 October 1998). Instead many \nbelieved the American president was giving unconditional support to unilateral Israeli \nmoves which were undermining any possibility of a just settlement. \nTheme 2: Explanations for the Conflict \nIn this section were analysed all references to the history of the conflict and the \nvarious factors which underpinned the dispute. This area of coverage is important \nbecause it provides rationale and explanations for the actions and motivations of the \nprotagonists. It is difficult for viewers to comprehend why the dispute has been so \nbitter, bloody and protracted without some information regarding the history of the \nconflict and the various issues which still separate the two parties. This area dealing \nwith explanations is also the most controversial aspect of reporting because it involves \na great deal of contested history. For instance, the Israeli and Palestinian perspectives \non issues such as refugees and settlements are markedly different. Three important \nareas of coverage were identified. The first deals with the origins and historical roots \n135 \nof the conflict, the second deals with explanations of the issues that were actually on \nthe table during the Wye Summit and the third deals with the issues which were \npostponed to the final status negotiations. These final status issues, such as the future \nof settlements, Jerusalem, and Palestinian refugees are at the heart of the conflict and \nit is very difficult to understand the conflict without some knowledge of them. \nThe Historical Origins of the Conflict \nThere were no attempts in the coverage to outline the history of the conflict or explain \nhow the protagonists had become involved in such a long running dispute. Out of \n1417 lines of coverage only 4 or 0.28 percent of the total coverage mentioned any \naspect of the conflict's history: \nAnd this morning in Israel settlers from the West Bank tried blocking \nPalestinian traffic praying for the talks to fail and urging Benjamin Netanyahu \nto return none of the land captured in 1967 (Channel 5 Lunchtime News, 22 \nOctober 1998) \nIn East Jerusalem which Israel has occupied since the 1967 war Palestinians \nwere relieved that the deadlock has been broken. (BBC I Early Evening News, \n24 October 1998) \nThe Luz family live in the settlement of Beit-El on land Israel captured in the \n1967 war because they feel this is the heartland of the Jewish people (BBC I \nEvening News, 24 October 1998) \nA swap of more Palestinian land occupied by Israel since 1967 in return for \ntougher Palestinian measures against Islamic terrorists. (BBC2 Newsnight, 23 \nOctober 1998) \nThese brief allusions to the six day war offer little to those who do not already possess \na knowledge of the conflict's history. All of the major issues separating the two \nparties, i. e. the settlements, Palestinian statehood, the refugees, the military \n136 \noccupation, the status of Jerusalem, and control of the region's water resources relate \nto key moments in the region's history. For instance, to understand the refugee issue \nrequires the knowledge that the refugee problem was created during the birth of the \nstate of Israel when approximately three quarter of a million Palestinians were \ndisplaced from their homes (Gilbert, 1999). Despite many UN resolutions they were \nnever allowed to return. To understand the military occupation, the significance of \nJerusalem, and why Israel has security concerns requires knowledge about the events \nof 1967 when Israel conquered the West Bank, Gaza Strip, Golan Heights and East \nJerusalem. Israelis and Palestinians, of course, offer different accounts of those two \npivotal years, but without any knowledge of events in 1948 and 1967 it is very \ndifficult to understand the conflict. However with a little historical background it \nbecomes easier to understand the significance of the various contentious issues and \nthe motivations of the two Parties. \nWhat is particularly ironic about the lack of historical context presented to \nviewers, is that many of the BBC reports were presented by its chief Middle East \ncorrespondent, Jeremy Bowen, who has written extensively about how the present \nconflict is in large part a consequence of the events of 1967. In Six Days: How the \n1967 War Shaped the Middle East Bowen argues that in order to understand why the \nconflict is so deep seated one must go back to the events of 1967: \nThe six day war swept up a generation of Israelis and Arabs whose children \nstill cannot live peacefully in the world the war created. Israelis deserve \npeaceful, safe lives. Palestinians who were dispossessed and exiled if they \nbecame refugees, humiliated and abused if they stayed, deserve justice. \nIsrael's overwhelming victory turned into a curse. It has never been able to \ndigest the land it swallowed in 1967. It has poured money in colonising the \nOccupied Territories, defying international law and splitting its own people. \nThirty six years after six days of fighting with Jordan, Egypt and Syria, after \nthousands more deaths and the failure of six years of negotiations Israelis and \nPalestinians are still fighting over the future of the West Bank and Gaza. It is \nstill a low intensity war. But if another full blown Middle East war breaks out, \nits roots will live in those six days in 1967. The Middle East will have no \npeace until Israelis and Palestinians, as equal partners settle the future of the \n137 \nland that was captured in 1967 and unwind the consequences of the war. \n(Bowen, 2004: 3-4) \nAn obvious question arises- if the journalist recognises so clearly the \nimportance of knowing about key moments in the region's history as a prerequisite \nfor understanding the conflict (and how to resolve it), then why doesn't he provide \nany information about those pivotal moments when he's standing in front of a camera \nas a BBC correspondent? Focus group work suggests that the lack of historical \ncontext has a serious impact on audiences' ability to understand the conflict and the \nmotivations of Israelis and Palestinians. However it was found that even providing a \nvery brief potted history of the conflict could have a 'dramatic effect' on the \nunderstanding of viewers: \nThe majority [of focus group members] also had no knowledge of the link \nbetween the wars of 1948 and 1967 \n- \nthat Palestinians who were displaced \nfrom what became Israel in 1948 moved to areas such as Gaza, the West Bank \nof the Jordan and East Jerusalem and were then subject to military occupation \nafter 1967. In the focus groups, the moderator was sometimes asked by the \nparticipants about the origins of the conflict. In response they were given a \nvery brief account of the events of 1948 and 1967, based on the work of the \nIsraeli historian Avi Shlaim (2000), and sometimes helped by the comments of \njournalists who were present. Although the account given was extremely brief \nit could have a very dramatic effect on the understanding of group members. \n(Philo and Berry, 2004: 213) \nThe lack of historical context is a particular problem for Palestinians because their \ngrievances such as the refugee issue and the military occupation, which are related to \nparticular historical events, are occasionally named but never properly explained so as \nto make clear their importance. Conversely, as will be seen, the major issue for \nIsraelis, their personal security, received extensive coverage. \n138 \nInterim Issues \nThis area of coverage involved what was actually under discussion at the Wye \nSummit. Understandably j ournalists chose to focus far more extensively on these \ninterim issues than on the more intractable and important final status issues, which \nhad been postponed to a later date. The discussion of interim issues accounted for 15 \npercent of total coverage (217 lines out of 1417). \nLand and Security \nOne of the ways the interim issues were explained was to group two main issues, the \nreturn of Palestinian land and the security of Israelis together. This accounted for 2.7 \npercent of total coverage (39 lines out of 1417) and approximately a third of all \ncoverage of interim issues. Journalists employed phrases such as 'land and security' \nor 'land for peace' as a form of shorthand for the central focus of the summit \nThe two sides have been talking for eight days trying to reach a deal over land \nand security in the West Bank (BBC I Evening News, 22 October 1998) \nNegotiators have been working through the night to draw up a new deal over \nland and security issues and President Clinton is expected to return later today \nto add his weight to any agreement (ITV Lunchtime News, 22 October 1998) \nAnd its an interim deal based on the exchange land for security (Channel 4 \nNews, 23 October 1998) \nBack in America President Clinton who has already spent 57 hours at the talks \nwaits in Washington, hoping to be called back to the talks if the two sides can \nconclude a deal on land and terrorism (Channel 5 Lunchtime News, 22 \nOctober 1998) \nJournalists are expected to point out what was actually being debated at the \nsummit but explanations presented in this format are not very informative to viewers \n139 \nwho lack detailed background knowledge of the conflict. With virtually no historical \nbackground provided in coverage it maybe difficult for viewers to understand what \n'land' in this context means. Is it Israeli land that is being given up as a compromise \nfor peace? or is it land that was conquered by Israel and is being returned to its legal \nowners? In coverage the status of the 'land' is unclear. Focus group research suggests \nthat viewers' understanding of the territorial dimensions of the conflict are confused \nand contradictory, with many viewers believing that the conflict involved two states \nfighting over a coveted piece of land, as in a border dispute (Philo & Berry, 2004). \nThe occupied territories are regarded under international law as Palestinian territory, \nand j ournalists could have made this clear by stating that Israel was returning land that \nit had captured during the six day war in 1967. On some occasions this was made \nclear. For instance on one Channel 5 bulletin (Lunchtime, 22 October 1998) a \njournalist reports that settlers were urging the Israeli Prime Minister 'to return none of \nthe land captured in 1967'. However on nearly 90 percent of occasions (28/32 \nreferences, 87.5 percent of the total) journalists used neutral phrases such as transfer, \npullback, withdrawal, or phrases which suggested Israel was transferring territory it \nowned such as 'giving up', 'giving away', or 'making concessions'. On only four \noccasions out of 32 was it made clear that Israel was 'returning' or 'handing back' \nterritory. \nIsrael's Security \nThe single issue which received the bulk of coverage was the subject of \nIsrael's security presented on its own. In total this accounted for 9 percent of all \ncoverage (129 lines out of 1417) and approximately 60 percent of the coverage of all \ninterim issues (129 lines out of 217). This theme became particularly pronounced \nafter a grenade attack on Israeli soldiers by a Palestinian at a bus station in Southern \nIsrael on the I 9th October 1998, which was frequently cited as a justification for \nIsrael's hard stance on security issues at the negotiations. Security was often \npresented as the central issue dividing the two parties and the 'stumbling block' to any \nfurther progress: \n140 \nA spokesman for Mr. Netanyahu said that it [the grenade attack in Southern \nIsrael] really reinforced the need for Israel to get strong and complete \nguarantees both in word and deed from the Palestinian side that they could \ncontrol terrorism and they could provide security on the West Bank (BBC I \nLunchtime News, 19 October 98) \nWhat you have now is an Israeli decision to talk about nothing at this summit \nconference except security. The Palestinians are furious about that, they are \nsaying it's a form of blackmail but as far as the Israelis are concerned they are \nsaying look no troop withdrawals can happen no meaningful negotiations can \ntake place unless we feel that the Palestinians are doing all within their power \nto ensure there are not attacks on Israelis and according to the Netanyahu \ngovernment the Palestinians simply cannot and will not deliver on that \nsecurity pledge (BBC I Evening News, 19 October 98) \nIt is perfectly legitimate to highlight the security concerns of Israelis. However \nthere are a number of problems with this coverage. Firstly without any information \nregarding the causes of the conflict it may be difficult for viewers without a deep \nknowledge of the dispute to understand why Israel has security concerns. The term \nneeds to be elaborated to make more explicit its meaning or meanings for audiences, \nbecause for Israelis and Palestinians the word has different connotations. The Israeli \ngovernment argues that Israel has a security problem because the Palestinian \nAuthority cannot or will not control 'terrorists' intent on killing Israelis. This was the \nperspective of the security issue provided by j ournalists especially on BBC, as in the \nfollowing examples: \nYes even before this bomb attack this was always going to be the stumbling \nblock the reluctance of Israel to pull out of the West Bank, the 13 percent they \nare negotiating about until the Palestinian Authority can provide guarantees \nthat they can control the terrorists (BBC lunchtime news, 19 October 1998) \nSecurity is the central sticking point. Yesterday's grenade attack at a bus stop \nin Beersheba injured 64 Israelis and while the Palestinians insist it was an \nisolated incident to the Israelis it was further evidence that Yasser Arafat \n141 \ncannot control Islamic militants. The Palestinian leader has instructed his \npolice force to clampdown on Hamas and other extremist groups. Mr. Arafat \nsays he gives the issue 100 percent commitment but admits he cannot promise \n100 percent results. The talks will resume later today the Palestinians say it's \ntime for the Israelis to make a brave decision for peace. The Israelis will once \nagain insist that their people must be safe from terrorist attack (BBC 1, \nLunchtime News, 20 October 1998) \nAn obvious unanswered question arises here: why are Palestinians risking \ntheir lives to attack Israelis? Since there is no historical background provided to \nviewers it may be difficult for them to understand Palestinian motivations. Focus \ngroup work in this area suggests that many viewers are confused about the \nmotivations of the parties. Whilst most participants had absorbed the message that \nIsrael-Palestine was a place of bloodshed, suffering and death, far fewer participants \nwere able to provide cogent explanations as to why the two sides were fighting. Some \nviewers linked this lack of understanding to the structure of television news and a lack \nof explanation in this area: \nFirst speaker: There's too many gaps, if you are being shown a partial picture, \nyou are obviously not being shown a whole picture \n... \nthey are showing you \nwhat they want you to see, and it shows, what we are seeing is what we are \nbeing fed. \nSecond speaker: They never really tell you the in-depth reasons about it- 'This \nguy went into bomb a pizza restaurant'- why? 'The Israelis are going to \nattack' - why? \nFirst speaker: What pushes them to that extreme? (Low income male group, \nLondon, cited in Philo & Berry, 2004: 211-212) \nThere is a recognition here that bombing a pizza restaurant is an 'extreme' \naction which requires some kind of explanation. People, unless they are mentally ill, \ngenerally don't behave in such ways unless they have some motive. Amnesty \nInternational, for instance, have repeatedly stressed that Israeli security concerns are a \nconsequence of human rights violations carried out against Palestinians by the Israeli \narmy and armed settlers: \n142 \nWithout human rights there can be no genuine security and no sustainable \npeace. Amnesty International requests the Commission to call on the Israeli \ngovernment to immediately cease violations of basic human rights and to \napply fully United Nation human rights treaties, as well as the Fourth Geneva \nConvention of 1949, in the Occupied Territories (Amnesty International, \n1999a) \nHowever there were no attempts in coverage to link the conditions created by \nthe occupation to Israel's security concerns and in one bulletin a BBC I journalist \nreports that the Israeli 'government here rejects emphatically all Palestinian \nsuggestions that its actions provoke attacks like this morning's' (BBC 1, Evening \nNews, 19 October 1998) There is no explanation of what these Israeli actions might \nbe, because the nature of the occupation and its social consequences for Palestinians \nare not discussed in coverage. One aspect of the occupation which has been linked to \nIsraeli security concerns involves the extensive use of torture by the Israeli security \nservices: \nA similar cycle of humiliation and mistreatment fomenting hatred has been \nobserved by the Palestinian psychiatrist Dr Eyad el-Sarraj, who studied suicide \nbombers. 'Most of them had suffered serious trauma when young, often that \ninvolved close relatives being tortured by the Israelis. 'he said. 'Children grow \nup wanting to take revenge for their trauma. Torture is an integral part of that \ncycle of violence. More oppression is making people more violent, in the way \nthat abused children become abusive fathers. '(Guardian, 24 January 2003) \nThere was also the question of what the security provisions of the agreement \nwould actually entail. Journalists here spoke of arresting 'terrorists', collecting \nweapons held by Palestinians and instituting a 'security clampdown': \nThe specifics of a Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants in the West \nBank and Gaza are still being worked out. Imprisonment of radicals and \nconfiscation of illegal weapons and key components. (BBC 1, early evening \nnews, 22 October 1998) \n143 \nThe Palestinian charter, their constitution, will abandon its demand for the \ndestruction of Israel and the CIA will help with a new security clampdown by \nthe Palestinians involving the arrest of 30 top Arab extremists (ITV, evening \nnews, 23 October 1998) \nThe nib of the agreement is that the Palestinians will curb violent extremism \n(Channel 4 news, 23 October 1998) \nHowever human rights groups and some print j ournalists had pointed out at \nthe time, that the security measures were rather more controversial than they appeared \nin the television news coverage. Robert Fisk noted that security provisions would \nmean more 'prison, hatred and (let's not be squeamish) torture' (Independent, 24 \nOctober 1998) The day before the agreement was signed on the 22 October 1998 \nHuman Rights Watch released a statement in Washington which urged the United \nStates and Israel not to pressure the Palestinian Authority to -implement the security \nprovisions of the agreement without all sides making a clear commitment to safeguard \nhuman rights. Hanny Megally, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Middle \nEast and North Africa Division, noted that the 'Palestinian Authority's human rights \nrecord is already deplorable, 'and that the 'U. S. doesn't condemn these violations now \n-- will the U. S. condemn violations once it is formally part of the process that creates \nthem? ' The Israeli human rights group B'Tselem published a report a month after the \nsigning of the Accords titled The Human Rights Fruits of the Wye Memorandum \nnoting that the two weeks after the signing the fruits are already apparent: 'mass \narbitrary arrests by both the Palestinian Authority and Israel'. The report further noted \nthat 'the agreement merely pays lip service to human rights, with no intention by any \nof the parties - Israel, the Palestinian National Authority or the United States \n- to hold \nthe sides accountable for human rights violations. ' The television news coverage \nmade no mention of the fact that the security provisions of the agreement might lead \nto an increase in human rights abuses including torture. \nIt was also argued that the security issue was that it was being used as a way \nof extending military control over Palestinians and undermining any prospect of land \ntransfers during the Oslo process. Prime Minister Netanyahu had consistently \ncampaigned against the 'peace process' before becoming Prime Minister and Avi \n144 \nShlaim has argued that Netanyahu by increasing house demolitions and settlement \nbuilding whilst cancelling the scheduled IDF redeployments was adopting a \"work\u0002to-rule' approach designed to undermine the Oslo process' (2000: 576). Similarly, \nProfessor Ian Lustick has argued that the Netanyahu government: \nfavored offering lip-service to the peace process in deference to the opinions \nof the majority of Israelis, while in fact using a 'work-to-rule' approach to the \nOslo Accords-treating them not as a basis for an evolving partnership, but as \nan array of legalist and public relations weapons that can free Israel of its \ncommitments, prevent further transfers of territory to Palestinian control, and \ndelegitimize Arafat and the idea of a Palestinian state in the mind of Israeli \npublic opinion. (1997: 87) \nWhen Palestinian spokespersons were given the opportunity to speak this \nscepticism towards negotiations was made explicit: \nThese incidents should not be used as an excuse to run away from negotiations \nabout the real problems in this area. And the real problem is the fact that the \nIsraelis are still occupying most of the Palestinian lands and the Palestinians \nare in need of self-determination. (BBC I, Lunchtime news, 19 October 1998) \nFrom my experience and assessment of the extremist ideological right wing \nfundamentalist stance of Netanyahu and the settlers and his cabinet it is very \nclear there is no commitment to a genuine peace and that the process is being \nmanipulated to continue Israeli control and to undermine Palestinian rights. \n(BBC 1, Evening News, 19 October 1998) \nThe Palestinian people are certainly much more sceptical they do not look at \nthis as a serious breakthrough or as an earth-shattering agreement it's like \npulling teeth and there's certainly is no confidence in the Israeli government or \nin the follow up steps (Channel 4 News, 23 October 1998) \nHowever when journalists provided commentary on the peace negotiations \nthey reproduced only the official Israeli perspective. In many bulletins, and \n145 \nparticularly on BBC 1 which featured the majority of explanations for the conflict, the \nIsraeli security perspective was given such overwhelming prominence that it \novershadowed all other questions appearing to be virtually the only issue, or at least in \nthe words of the BBC's Stephen Sackar 'the key issue'. Here are some exchanges \nbetween journalists illustrating this: \nNewscaster: But Stephen what are the main obstacles to peace? \nJournalist: Well I just mentioned security arrangements Moira, and those are \nthe key issues and in a sense the key obstacles. It's quite clear now that the \nIsraelis are committed to pulling back from a further 13 percent of the West \nbank but only if the Palestinians can convince them that they are able to offer \nnew written cast-iron security commitments, better than anything they have \noffered in the past. There are key issues like the Israelis wanting the \nextradition of more than 30 Palestinian Islamic militants to Israel for trial. For \nexample they want to make sure that illegal weapons held by Palestinians in \nthe West Bank and Gaza are confiscated. Those are specific detailed issues the \nIsraelis want the Palestinians to deliver and they want American intelligence \nto be involved to verify Palestinian compliance. (BBC I, Early Evening News, \n18 October 1998) \nNewscaster: Joining me now is our Washington correspondent Tom Carver. \nTom its early morning there, I know, but has there been any reaction yet to \nthis attack in Israel. \nJournalist: Yes officials from both sides have said that they will not leave the \nnegotiating table that they will continue to stay here despite the attack. A \nspokesman for Mr. Netanyahu said that it really reinforced the need for Israel \nto get strong and complete guarantees both in word and deed from the \nPalestinian side that they could control terrorism and they could provide \nsecurity on the West Bank. So this clearly will have played into the hands of \nthe hard-liners in Netanyahu's government and will make it very hard for him, \nI think, to convince his hard-liners back home that he can get those sort of \nguarantees from the Palestinians. \n146 \nNewscaster: And it is those security issues that are proving the most difficult \nto overcome in the talks is it? \nJournalist- Yes even before this bomb attack this was always going to be the \nstumbling block the reluctance of Israel to pull out of the West Bank, the 13 \npercent that they are negotiating about until the Palestinian Authority can \nprovide guarantees that they can control the terrorists and it seems that this is \nexactly the sort of thing that Israel is dreading this sort of attack. And, of \ncourse, the Palestinians will say we can provide the security but we must also \nnegotiate about other things about Israel's continued occupation of the \nterritories. (BBC I, Lunchtime news, 19 October 1998) \nIn one of the above examples aj ournalist argues that 'It's quite clear now that \nthe Israelis are committed to pulling back from a further 13 percent of the West bank' \nif they can get the required 'security guarantees'. However as already noted \nPalestinians regarded this as far from 'clear' which is why Palestinian spokespersons \nhad expressed 'no confidence in the Israeli government or in the follow up steps'. \nPrime Minister Netanyahu had repeatedly suspended previous scheduled troop re\u0002deployments and six weeks after Wye again cancelled the scheduled troop \nredeployments unless the Palestinians fulfilled five conditions most of which were \nnew and according to Avi Shlaim 'designed to torpedo the peace process and put the \nresponsibility on the Palestinians' (2000: 605). However there was no attempt by \njournalists on any channel to articulate the Palestinian position that the arguments \naround security were being employed as an excuse to avoid land transfers and extend \nIsraeli control over the occupied territories. It would not have been difficult for \njournalists to provide the Palestinian perspective along with the Israeli viewpoint: \nYes officials from both sides have said that they will not leave the negotiating \ntable that they will continue to stay here despite the attack. A spokesman for \nMr. Netanyahu. said that it really reinforced the need for Israel to get strong \nand complete guarantees both in word and deed from the Palestinian side that \nthey could control terrorism and they could provide security on the West \nBank. However Palestinians argue that the Israelis government, which is \n147 \ncomposed ofparties opposed to the peace process, are using arguments about \nsecurity to avoid the return of occupied Palestinian land and instead \nstrengthen their hold on the Palestinian territories. \nOne reason why there was so much coverage dealing with the security \nprovisions of the agreement was that j oumalists used this element of the accords as a \npoint of linkage to the concerns of Israeli settlers living in the occupied territories. \nThis made specific connections between the security provisions of Wye and the \ndangers faced by individual settlers. Here are some exchanges between joumalists and \nsettlers: \nJournalist Less than a mile away rabbi Benny Alon, one of the leaders of the \nreligious right in Israel's parliament is getting ready for the Jewish Sabbath at \na synagogue in an otherwise Palestinian area that his supporters have just re\u0002occupied. Rabbi Alon says the right will try to bring the government down \nbecause he believes Benjamin, BB, Netanyahu has put Israel in danger. \nIsraeli Settler: BB Netanyahu established in this summit the Palestinian state \nand by this he risks not only the Jewish revival he risks the Jewish state of \nIsrael's survival. (BBC 1, Evening News, 23 October 1998) \nJournalist: Mecaby Luz is worried about his children's safety. The Luz family \nlive in the settlement of Beit-El on land Israel captured in the 1967 war \nbecause they feel this is the heartland of the Jewish people. Now they're \ndisgusted that the prime minister they voted for is transferring more territory \nto the Palestinians. \nIsraeli Settler: This agreement endangers us more than we were endangered \nbefore. We're worried because we've seen friends of ours killed and the \nmurders run away it takes them two minutes to flee into the autonomy areas \nand now there's going to be more of these areas and we are very scared and \nwe are very disappointed. (BBC 1, Evening News, 24 October 1998) \n148 \nJournalist: At the Israeli West Bank settlement of Beit-El hardline settlers \nfollowed the news on car radios as they hurried home before the sabbath \nshutdown. The settlement is already close to Palestinian homes and maybe \nvirtually surrounded by Palestinian territory under the new agreement. Many \nof the settlers are bitterly disappointed and planning protest action. \nIsraeli Settler: We believe that we are going to be subject to firebombs to arms \nto bombings to you name it. (ITV Evening News, 23 October 1998) \nIt is perfectly legitimate forjoumalists to highlight the security concems of \nIsraeli settlers and how the provisions of Wye will affect them. However there was \nlittle attempt to show or discuss how the security provisions, or as many Palestinians \nsaw it \n- the extension of military rule, had affected the lives of ordinary Palestinians. \nThe closest any broadcaster came to this was this single brief mention in one BBC I \nbulletin: \nJournalist: At the Palestinian house restaurant in Ramallah, one of the biggest \ntowns controlled by Yasser Arafat on the West Bank, they were getting ready \nfor a birthday party. They didn't see any point in celebrating the peace process \nthough when Israel still controls Palestinian lives. \nPalestinian civilian: You need pennission to go to Jerusalem first of all, \nJerusalem is closed always. If you have a West Bank ID there's no way you \ncan get in. If you want to go to Nabulus if there's a closure you can't even \nreach Nabulus. If you want to go anywhere you can't, it's ridiculous I think \nit's a joke. \nThis was a very important facet of the military occupation which wasn't \nhighlighted anywhere else in coverage. The reason why Israel still controls Palestinian \nlives' is that during the Oslo process Israel had built a matrix of military checkpoints \nacross the occupied territories which meant that Palestinians found it difficult to travel \nanywhere in the West Bank. This building programme which had drastically altered \nthe geography of the West Bank and would have been difficult for j ournalists to miss. \nThe enforcement by Israel, of what the United Nations had condemned as illegal \n149 \nclosures and 'flagrant violations of international law', had a serious impact on the \nPalestinian economy which had been severely damaged, and all other aspects of social \nlife: \nDuring years of waiting for promised benefits, Palestinians have seen their \nstandard of living steadily decline. In the seven years between the signing of \nthe Oslo Accords and the start of the uprising in September 2000, Israeli \npolicies -- including border controls, retention of Palestinian funds, and \nrestrictions on trade, investment, and access to water resources -- resulted in \ngrowing trade and budget deficits for the Palestinians. Unemployment was \nhovering at 50 percent, poverty rates increased, health standards deteriorated, \nand any sense of opportunity among Palestinian youth began to fade (Yackley \n& Zunes, 2002) \nThis was the only time that i ournalists mentioned the social impact of the \ndemographic changes initiated by the Israelis during the peace process. \nThe Military Occupation \nIn total mentions of the occupation accounted for 15 lines or I percent of coverage. \nOn each occasion the issue was merely named. The fact that it was military in nature \nand had serious social consequences for Palestinians wasn't mentioned: \nAnd, of course, the Palestinians will say we can provide the security but we \nmust also negotiate about other things about Israel's continued occupation of \nthe territories. (BBC 1, Lunchtime News, 19 October 1998) \nIn East Jerusalem which Israel has occupied since the 1967 war Palestinians \nwere relieved that the deadlock has been broken. (BBC 1, Early Evening News, \n24 October 1998) \nHe comes from the occupied West Bank and is said by the Israeli authorities to \nhave deliberately targeted soldiers. (ITV, Lunchtime News, 19 October 1998) \n150 \nA swap of more Palestinian land occupied by Israel since 1967 in return for \ntougher Palestinian measures against Islamic terrorists. (BBC2, Newsnight, 23 \nOctober 1998) \nHowever, human rights groups have been less reticent in documenting the social \nconsequences of living under the military occupation: \nAmnesty International has for many years documented and condemned \nviolations of international human rights and humanitarian law by Israel \ndirected against the Palestinian population of the Occupied Territories. They \ninclude unlawful killings; torture and ill-treatment; arbitrary detention; unfair \ntrials; collective punishments such as punitive closures of areas and \ndestruction of homes; extensive and wanton destruction of property; \ndeportations; and discriminatory treatment as compared to Israeli settlers. \nMost of these violations are grave breaches of the Fourth Geneva Convention \nand are therefore war crimes. Many have also been committed in a widespread \nand systematic manner, and in pursuit of government policy; such violations \nmeet the definition of crimes against humanity under international law. \n(Amnesty International, 2002) \nIf the nature and consequences of the military occupation are not explained by \njournalists it is unlikely that viewers will be aware of them. Focus group work \nsuggests that many participants did not understand that the Palestinians had been \nsubject to a military occupation since 1967. They also found that few viewers were \naware that human rights abuses were a part of the occupation. They related this \nignorance to omissions in news coverage: \nThere was little understanding of areas such as human rights- only two people \nin all the focus groups raised these as an issue. Even in groups that tended to \nbe sympathetic with the Palestinians (such as low-income males in London) \nthere was some surprise that there were pass laws and identity cards which \nrestricted movement. There was no almost no knowledge of the large number \nof UN resolutions which have been passed, either those relation to the legality \n151 \nof the occupation or those relating to human rights abuses in the occupied \nterritories. (Philo & Berry, 2004: 218) \nCoverage of the interim issues was dominated by the issue of Israeli security \nconcerns, which was the only aspect of the agreement which was explained in a \ndetailed manner. Most other issues like the land issue and the military occupation \nwere named without being explained. Journalists spoke in a kind of shorthand which \nassumed a level of background knowledge, which focus group research suggests is \nlacking in most viewers. There were three other issues referred to: \n\" The release of Palestinian Prisoners (0.8 percent of total coverage, II lines) \n\" The rewriting of PLO charter (0.3 percent of coverage, 4 lines) \n\" Economic development in occupied territories \n- \nland links, port, airport (0.1 \npercent of coverage, 2 lines) \nFinal Status Issues \nCoverage of final status issues accounted for 4 percent of coverage (63 lines \nout of 1417). More than two thirds of this (42 lines out of 63) dealt with Israeli \nsettlements and settlers' anger and concerns. The other primary issues of concern to \nPalestinians: statehood, refugees, water and Jerusalem accounted in total for 1.5 \npercent of coverage (21 lines out of 1417). The final status issues were only \nmentioned in the final two days coverage of the talks, when j ournalists switched their \nattention to the issues that hadn't been part of the negotiations. Reporters stressed the \nlimited aspect of what being signed at Wye, and then named without explaining the \nfinal status issues still to be resolved. \nSettlements \nThe issue of Jewish settlements is one of the most contentious issues in the conflict. \nThere are a number of different ways for journalists to approach the issue of \n152 \nsettlements and their significance in the conflict. Journalists can present the Israeli \nsettler's perspective which maintains that Israeli Jews have a right to construct \nsettlements anywhere in the occupied territories because the land was given to them \nby God. The Israeli government has also argued that the settlement blocks close to the \nGreen Line have a security function because they act as a bulwark preventing \nPalestinians from entering Israel. For the Israeli government and settler groups the \ntwo primary issues in relation to the settlement question are whether any of the \nsettlements will have to be removed in the course of the peace process and the safety \nof Israelis living in settlements, who have come into conflict with Palestinians. There \nis also the question of the political muscle of settler groups who have a powerful \nvoice within Israeli political life, and formed a significant part of Prime Minister \nNetanyahu's ruling coalition. They have been strongly opposed to the peace process \nand any return of Palestinian land captured in 1967. The perspective on settlements \nheld by Palestinians and the international community is at odds with the Israeli \nperspective. Palestinians see settlements as a form of colonisation whereby the settler \npopulation has been stealing Palestinian land and dispossessing the local Population. \nThe settlements close to the Green line were designed to have a strategic function in \nthat they allowed the Israeli state to gain control of West Bank land and the region's \nwater supply (Shlaim, 2000). This is a serious issue for Palestinians because their \neconomy is largely agricultural and so access to water is vital. Palestinians also point \nout that all settlers are armed with automatic weapons and mount attacks against the \nPalestinian population who are not legally allowed to own weapons. A report by the \nIsraeli human rights group B'Tselem argued that armed intimidation was used as a \ntactic to force Palestinians off their land: \nActions initiated by settlers against Palestinians and their property are carried \nout by individuals or organized groups to intimidate, deter, or punish, using \nfirearms and ammunition provided to them by the IDF. Such action may be a \nreprisal operation following Palestinian violence, or it may be unrelated to any \nspecific previous incident. Among the settlers' actions against Palestinians are \nsetting up roadblocks to disrupt normal Palestinian life, shooting at roof-top \nwater heaters burning cars, smashing windows, destroying crops and \nuprooting trees, and harassing merchants and owners of stalls in the market. \nSome of the settlers' violence against Palestinians is intended to force \n153 \nPalestinians to leave their homes or land, so that the perpetrators can take \ncontrol over Palestinian land. (B'Tselem, 1998) \nThe friction between Palestinians and Israeli settlers has worsened during the \npeace process because of the large rise in the settler population, and the fact that \nsettlers are rarely prosecuted when they attack or kill Palestinians (Amnesty \nInternational, 200 1 a). Between the start of the peace process in 1991 and the Wye \nAccords the settler population in the occupied territories (excluding East Jerusalem) \nrose by 80 percent from 94,100 in 1991 to 169,400 in 1998 \n. \nRunning concurrently \nwith this rise has been an increasing expropriation of West Bank land for settlement \npurposes. It is widely argued that the settlements are illegal under international law \nbecause they breach the Fourth Geneva Convention, article 49 of which stipulates the \noccupying power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own population into the \nterritories it occupies. ' The United Nations has been extremely critical of the \nsettlement program in the occupied territories passing annual resolutions that have \ndeemed the settlements illegal and in need of removal. These resolutions have been \npassed with large majorities at the General Assembly with one passed ten months \nprior to Wye by 149 votes to 2 (Israel, United States). The European Parliament has \nalso issued statements condemning settlement building. 41 \nIn coverage j oumalists highlighted only three aspects of the settlement question: \nwhat would be the future of Israeli settlements in the occupied territories, the security \nof settlers living in the occupied territories and settler opposition to the Wye Accords: \nThey haven't even started to tackle the most serious issues yet those include \nthe future of Jewish settlements like this one, the future of Jerusalem, of \nPalestinian refugees and the shape of Israel's final borders. (BBC I Evening \nNews, 23 October 98) \n... \nthese are small measures of Progress compared to the really big issues \nwhich remain to be addressed in any kind of final settlement. That's for \nexample the fate of Jerusalem, the fate of the Israeli settlements on the West \nBank, and whether or not the Palestinians get a state. Those are the ones that \nthey'll really have to try for (ITV Early Evening News, 23 October 1998) \n154 \nI was just at an Israeli settlement on the West Bank called Betel, they run the \nrisk of being virtually isolated, virtually cut off under this agreement. Not \nsurprisingly they are bitterly against it (ITV Early Evening News, 23 October \n1998) \nJewish settlers mounted protests on West Bank roads. There is a feeling that \nMr. Netanyahu's decision to pull back from the brink of a walk out yesterday \nmakes an agreement and a 13 percent Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank \nmore likely (BBC I Early Evening News, 22 October 1998) \nThis is a rather incomplete and partial treatment of the settlement issue. There \nis no discussion of what a settlement is or its strategic role in controlling the land and \nwater resources of the occupied territories. There is also no mention of the fact that \nsettlers are heavily armed and have been repeatedly censured by the United Nations \nand human rights groups for taking land and attacking Palestinians. From the \ncoverage it could appear as if they are civilians who are being attacked for no obvious \nreason. Focus group work suggests that some viewers had internalised this view of \nsettlements as vulnerable communities, subject to violent attacks for no clearly \ndiscernable reason (Philo & Berry, 2004). On the issue of the legitimacy of the \nsettlements viewers are only presented with the settlers' perspective: \nJewish settlers who held prayer demonstrations believe this land was given to \nthem by God and their homes and their families already heavily guarded will \nbe in danger if any more of it is turned over to the Palestinians (BBC I \nEvening News 23 October 1998) \nThe Luz family live in the settlement of Beit-El on land Israel captured in the \n1967 war because they feel this is the heartland of the Jewish people. Now \nthey're disgusted that the prime minister they voted for is transferring more \nterritory to the Palestinians. (BBC I Evening News, 24 October 1998) \nIsrael will stay quiet until the Jewish Sabbath ends at sunset this evening. Only \nthen will the religious nationalistic right start the campaign which it promises \nwill bring down the Netanyahu government to try to stop the handover to the \n155 \nPalestinians of more of the land that religious Israelis believe God gave to the \nJews (BBC I Early Evening News, 24 October 1998) \nThere is no attempt to balance the claim of divine right to the land held by \nsettlers with the view that most governments regard the settlements as being illegal \nand a violation of the Geneva Convention. It is also noteworthy that in the above \nexample that the journalist presents the settlers' perspective that they 'will be in \ndanger if any more of it is turned over to the Palestinians'. In another broadcast on \nITV a reporter states that: \nAt the Israeli West Bank settlement of Beit-El hardline settlers followed the \nnews on car radios as they hurried home before the Sabbath shutdown. The \nsettlement is already close to Palestinian homes and maybe virtually \nsurrounded by Palestinian territory under the new agreement. Many of the \nsettlers are bitterly disappointed and planning protest action. (ITV Evening \nNews, 23 October 1998) \nPalestinians and independent human rights groups have argued that the settlers \nare putting themselves in danger not because of an agreement to hand back territory, \nbut because they have been forcing Palestinians off their land and constructing illegal \nsettlements. However this perspective is absent. The above example from ITV is \nparticularly confused arguing that the settlements 'maybe surrounded by Palestinian \nterritory' which misses the obvious point that the settlements were actually built on \nwhat the international community regards as Palestinian territory, which is why they \nare so bitterly resented by Palestinians. Out of the 42 lines of coverage which dealt \nwith the settlement issue only one referenced the Palestinian perspective (though \nwithout actually interviewing any Palestinians): \nIsraeli peace campaigners went to help Palestinians on the West Bank with the \nolive harvest. The Palestinians here say Jewish settlers are trying to take their \nland. These Israeli leftists believe their country will never have peace until the \nPalestinians have justice. (BBC I Evening News, 24 October 1998) \n156 \nThere is no indication as to whether the Palestinian claim that settlers 'are \ntrying to take their land' is true, it is reported as an unsubstantiated claim. The \njournalist then tells viewers that 'these Israeli leftists believe their country will never \nhave peace until the Palestinians have justice', but it is far from obvious to viewers, \nwho lack a detailed knowledge of the conflict, how the existence of settlements \naffects Palestinian 'justice', or even for that matter what 'justice' in this context \nmeans. Without providing any information on the pivotal role of settlements in the \nstruggle to control the region's land and water, statements such as these are unlikely \nto be comprehensible to most viewers. \nJerusalem \nJerusalem is the centre of the religious, cultural, social and economic existence of \nIsraelis and Palestinians. The city has particular significance to the Judean, Christian \nand Muslim faiths due to the presence of important holy sites. Israel argues the city is \nits 'eternal and undivided capital' because of its religious significance and the fact \nthat the city has always had a significant Jewish population. Palestinians want Arab \nEast Jerusalem as the capital of any prospective Palestinian state, and have been \nangered by Israeli moves to alter the demographic composition of the city. Arab East \nJerusalem has been under military occupation since 1967 and in the interim period \nhuman rights groups note that Israel has carried out sustained illegal settlement \nprograms and has been expelling Palestinians and destroying their homes at an \nincreasing rate. According to Amnesty International the purpose of these practices in \nEast Jerusalem has been 'to transform the ethnic character of the annexed area from \nArab to Jewish' by the restriction and confiscation of residency documents, and the \ndestruction of Palestinian homeS42 \n. \nAt present Amnesty estimates that about 35 \nperecnt of East Jerusalem has been confiscated, more than 90 percent of which had \nbeen owned by Palestinians and used for grazing or cultivation. Of the current \nestimate of 28,000 Palestinian homes in East Jerusalem, Amnesty reports that \napproximately 12,000 or 43 percent of the total are under demolition orders from the \nIsraeli authorities. The UN has also been heavily critical of these Israeli Practices in \nArab East Jerusalem. Ten months prior to the Wye Accords a UN resolution \ncondemning the expulsions and house demolitions was passed by 148 votes to one \n157 \n(Israel) with nine abstentions. It has also passed numerous General Assembly and \nSecurity Council resolutions asking Governments not to move their embassies to \nJerusalem and declaring all moves by Israel to alter the demographic character of the \ncity as invalid. In this coverage, the future of Jerusalem accounted for 0.6 percent of \ntotal coverage (9 lines out of 1417). None of the references to the issue extended \nbeyond a single sentence, and none explained the significance of the issue: \nThe big issues, the future of Jerusalem and the Palestinian demand for \nstatehood must now be faced. (BBC 1: 21: 00,23 October 98) \nAnd the really tough stuff lies ahead, the so called permanent status issues \nwhich should by rights be decided within the next six months, can Jerusalem \nbe shared? The Palestinians want a part of it as their capital. (BBC2: 22: 30,23 \nOctober 98) \n.. \nthese are small measures of progress compared to the really big issues which \nremain to be addressed in any kind of final settlement. That's for example the \nfate of Jerusalem, the fate of the Israeli settlements on the West Bank (ITV: \n17: 45,23 October 98) \nThere is an acknowledgement by j ournalists that the future of Jerusalem is a \n'big issue' but no explanations as to why. This is significant because another major \nPalestinian grievance that is driving the conflict is left unexamined. Focus group \nresearch suggests that most viewers who rely on television news as their main source \nof information are very confused about what the two sides are fighting over (Philo & \nBerry, 2004). Some viewers believed that the conflict involved neighbours who \ncouldn't get along, or fanatics who harboured inexplicable and irrational hatreds. This \nis to be expected, if there is little explanation of the political and territorial dimensions \nof the dispute. \n158 \nPalestinian Refugees \nThe fate of Palestinian refugees is one of the most intractable issues separating the \ntwo sides. It is so important that many on both sides regard it as a 'deal breaker' with \nthe potential to scupper any attempts to reach a final settlement. The bulk of the \nrefugees were created in 1948 when approximately 750,000 Palestinians were \ndisplaced during the creation of the Israeli state (Gilbert, 1999). A further 320,000 \nPalestinian refugees (and 90,000 Syrian refugees) were created in 1967 when Israel \ninvaded the West Bank, Gaza Strip and Golan Heights (Harris, 1980). The refugees \nand their descendents now number more than five million according to the United \nNations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA) and are \nconcentrated primarily in the occupied territories, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria, with \n1.2 million living permanently in very poor social conditions in refugee camps. A \nreport published in the British Medical Journal by the British charity Medical Aid for \nPalestinians catalogued the severe health problems experienced by people living in \ncamps including infectious diseases linked to poor sanitation; mental health problems \nassociated with displacement and with experiencing prolonged bombardment; \nintellectual and physical disability among children; poor health among pregnant \nwomen and infants; and chronic diseases such as diabetes. (17 March 1999). \nAll Israeli political parties (excluding the Arab and Communist parties) are \nopposed to the return of Palestinian refugees to Israel because they argue that it would \nthreaten both the security and the Jewish character of the State. 43 For Palestinians the \nright of return for refugees lies at the heart of the conflict. The expulsion of the \nrefugees in 1948 is remembered by Palestinians as Al Nakba, the catastrophe, and \npossible solutions to the refugee problem have generated much debate amongst \nPalestinianS44 \n. \nThe United Nations has been supportive of the right to return. On the \nI Ith December 1948 the United Nations General Assembly passed UN resolution 194 \nwhich established the right of return for all Palestinian refugees displaced in the 1948 \nWar: \nResolves that the refugees wishing to return to their homes and live at peace \nwith their neighbours should be permitted to do so at the earliest practicable \ndate, and that compensation should be paid for the property of those choosing \nnot to return and for loss of or damage to property which, under principles of \n159 \ninternational law or in equity, should be made good by the Governments or \nauthorities responsible \nTen months prior to Wye the 'right of return' was re-affirmed by the United \nNations by the margin of 159 votes to two (Israel, United States) with one abstention. \nThere has also been support for the right to return from the European Union. 45 \nAlthough both sides admit the absolute centrality of the issue to any resolution of the \nconflict it received scant mention in coverage. References to the refugee question \naccounted for 0.2 percent of coverage (3 lines out of 1417). On each occasion the \nissue was named but not explained: \nThey haven't even started to tackle the most serious issues yet those include \nthe future of Jewish settlements like this one, the future of Jerusalem, of \nPalestinian refugees and the shape of Israel's final borders. (BBC I Evening \nNews, 23 October 98) \nIs there to be a right of return for Arab refugees? How many will be permitted \nto come in from exile, and when? (BBC2 Newsnight, 23 October 98) \nAhis really only takes us through till the final settlement which will involve \nthe most difficult problems of all, questions like the final settlement of \nJerusalem, the return of refugees (ITV Lunchtime News, 23 October 98) \nControl of Water Resources \nAnother key final status issue concerns the water supplies of the occupied \nterritories. As previously noted the construction of Jewish settlements in the occupied \nterritories was linked to the struggle over the water supplies of the region. This has \nmeant that Israel has taken control of the water supply of the occupied territories most \nof which is diverted for the use of settlements and Israeli industry. The Israeli human \nrights organisation B'Tselem has noted that Israeli water practices breach \ninternational law and have a highly negative impact on all aspects of life in the \noccupied territories: \n160 \nHundreds of thousands of Palestinians suffer from a severe water shortage \nthroughout the summer. This shortage of water affects every function that \nwater plays in human life: drinking, bathing, cleaning, and watering of crops \nand animals The shortage drastically affects the residents' health and economic \nwell-being. The shortage of drinking water can cause dehydration and the \ninability to maintain proper hygiene and thus lead to illness. Failure to water \ncrops and animals affects the livelihood of the residents. The water shortage \nviolates the basic human rights of Palestinian residents of the Occupied \nTerritories such as the right to health, to adequate housing, to equality, and to \nbenefit from their natural resources. This harin results from Israeli policy, in \neffect since 1967, based on an unfair division of resources shared by Israel and \nthe Palestinians. (B'Tselem, 1998, The Water Crisis in the Occupied \nTerritories) \nThe United Nations has been critical of the Israeli policy on West Bank water \nnoting that it breaches international law. It has passed numerous resolutions pointing \nout that Israel must not exploit the water resources of the occupied territories. 46 The \nissue of water is of central importance to the conflict yet it accounted for only 0.07 \npercent of total coverage (I line out of 1417). The single reference to the issue \nappeared during BBC2's Newsnight, rather than during the mass audience bulletins \non BBC I or ITV: \nHow is water to be shared an eternal and crucial problem in the Middle East \n(BBC2: 22: 30,23 October 1998) \nThis reference is rather brief and requires explaining so as to make clear the \nimportance of water in the context of the conflict. Sometimes journalists grouped a \nnumber of interim issues together in their discussion of what was still to be negotiated \nas in the following examples: \nThey haven't even started to tackle the most serious issue yet. Those include \nthe future of Jewish settlements like this one, the future of Jerusalem, of \n161 \nPalestinian refugees and the shape of Israel's final borders (BBC I evening \nnews, 23 October 1998) \nWe have to recognise above all that this is an interim deal that really only \ntakes us through to the final settlement which will involve the most difficult \nproblems of all, questions like the final settlement of Jerusalem, the return of \nrefugees and for example the final borders of a Palestinian state. (ITV, \nlunchtime news, 23 October 1998) \nWell if so they're going to get there by inches because these are small \nmeasures of progress compared to the really big issues which remain to be \naddressed in any kind of final settlement. That's for example the fate of \nJerusalem, the fate of the Israeli settlements on the West Bank, and whether or \nnot the Palestinians get a state. Those are the ones that they'll really have to \ntry for. (ITV, early evening news, 23 October 1998) \nJust naming the major issues is unlikely to be helpful to most viewers. Each \nissue must be individually explained by j ournalists so as to make clear its relevance \nand importance. \nTheme 3: The Peace Process: Effects and Implications \nThis area involved Israeli and Palestinian perspectives on whether the process \nwas achieving its objectives. Under the terms of the Oslo Accords by the time of \nWye, Israel was due to have withdrawn its troops from most of the West Bank, and \npennanent status negotiations should have been underway for more than a year, with \ntheir completion scheduled for May 1999. However when the Wye Accords took \nplace Palestinians had total control over only 3 percent of the West Bank and the final \nstatus talks had not even begun, with each side accusing the other of bad faith in \nfailing to implement their obligations under the agreements. Discussion of the peace \nprocess accounted for 2 percent of total coverage (30 lines out of 1417). All of this \ncoverage merely stated that the peace process has been stalled for approximately 18 \nmonths or that the Accords have brought 19 months of deadlock to an end: \n162 \nTonight the summit is in deep trouble it was supposed to revive the peace \nprocess which effectively collapsed 19 months ago. Because the gap between \nthe two sides is so wide the Summit was never going to produce anything \nmore than a limited and fragile agreement. (BBC I, Evening News, 19 October \n98) \nA clearly elated Yasser Arafat has been in Austria today taking the plaudits \nfrom European ministers for his part in the settlement which has broken the \ndeadlock in the Middle East. (ITV, Early Evening, 24 October 98) \nAfter nine days of titanic negotiations it seemed the Americans had managed \nto broker a deal on a land for peace settlement that would break 19 months of \ndeadlock. (Channel 4, News, 23 October 98) \nHere is a discussion on the subject between a Channel 4 news anchor and a \njournalist on the state of the 'peace process' and its prospects: \nNewscaster: And what is the Armageddon scenario? In other words if it does \ngo wrong and people are saying it's pretty serious? \nJournalist: It's serious. It just drags on. It seems to go on forever. These talks \nhave been stalled for the last 18 months. They're going nowhere. \nNewscaster: But on the ground people are saying it could be disastrous. \nJournalist: On the ground people are getting angry, Palestinians are getting \nangry, Israelis are getting angry. Both sides are getting extremely angry, it \nnever seems to quite boil up and boil over. But I think that this is extremely \nserious because what it means is that all the accords that were signed in Oslo, \nall those years ago, they really are going absolutely nowhere. (Channel 4 \nNews, 21 October 1998) \n163 \nThis exchange offers a descriptive account letting viewers know that there are \nserious problems with the peace process and that this is intensifying anger on both \nsides. However it offers viewers no explanations. As previously noted, the Israeli \nargument that the breakdown in the peace process were caused by the failure of the \nPalestinian Authority to halt attacks by Palestinians was extensively reported by \njournalists. The Palestinian position that the Israelis had used the Oslo process to take \nmore land and water and build settlements wasn't provided by j ournalists. There were \nfour references claiming that the Oslo process hasn't achieved its objectives for either \nPalestinians or Israelis: \nThe peace process has been in a state of collapse for 19 months. Even if the \nSummit does produce an agreement it will be limited and fragile. It's almost \nimpossible these days to find anybody Israeli or Palestinian who still has faith \nin the peace process. After four years it hasn't delivered peace or security for \nIsraelis, or the land, dignity and self-determination that the Palestinians want. \n(BBC I, lunchtime & early evening news, 19 October 1998) \nThe previous Oslo deal was signed amid euphoria but then failed to deliver \nmuch freedom for the Palestinians or security to the Israelis. (ITV: 13: 00,23 \nOctober 98) \nWe'll have to see whether this is a turning point reviving the peace process or \nwhether this is one good day in a process which for so long has been deeply \nwretched and has delivered nothing either to the people of Israel or the \nPalestinians. (BBC2: 22: 30,23 October 98) \nThese statements may be difficult for viewers, who lack detailed knowledge of \nthe conflict, to understand. The journalists speak in a shorthand which assumes a high \nlevel of background knowledge that focus groups research suggests most audience \nmembers don't possess (Philo & Berry, 2004). Words like 'security', 'freedom', and \n'self-determination' which are employed without explanation are only really \ncomprehensible if you understand the history of the conflict and the ramifications of \nthe military occupation. One of the reports above argues that the process 'has \ndelivered nothing either to the people of Israel or the Palestinians'. This is a \n164 \nquestionable statement which ignores some of the central factors driving the \ncontinuance of the occupation. Although the Oslo process had failed to deliver \nsecurity to ordinary Israelis it had allowed the Israeli state to appropriate more West \nBank land, expand settlements in Jerusalem and across the occupied territories, \nnionopolise the regions water resources on which Israeli industry is heavily reliant, \nand open up Arab markets to Israeli goods and services. There was one reference on \nChannel 4 that Israel at this summit may finally 'sign up properly to the Oslo \nAccords' (19: 00,23 October 98) and one reference on Channel 5 that 'Palestinians \nargue that peace is fragile because Israel hasn't even enforced what's already been \nagreed' (12: 00,22 1998). However these brief and cryptic comments needed to be \nexpanded and explained. Journalists appear to be shying away from providing \nexplanations as to why Palestinians had lost faith in the peace process. \nTheme 4: ODDosition/Attitudes to the Wve Accords \nCoverage of opposition to the Wye Accords accounted for 10 percent of all coverage \n(138 lines out of 1417). Two thirds of this coverage (93 lines out of 138) dealt with \nthe issue of Israeli settler opposition to the Accords, a fifth (29 lines out of 138) dealt \nwith Palestinian opposition and approximately a tenth (16 lines out of 13 8) lumped \nPalestinian and Israeli opposition together as in the examples below: \nThey [delegates at the summit] all radiated optimism but they also warned that \nopponents of peace Israeli and Arab might use violence to try to destroy what \nthey had achieved. (BBC I, Early Evening News, 24 October 1998) \nIn both camps zealots will do their damnedest to bring down the peace process \nas it continues to unfold. Islamic terrorists on the one side fighting what they \ncall a holy war, nationalists bigots and ultra-religious fundamentalists in \nIsrael's midst. (BBC2, Newsnight, 23 October 1998) \nIsrael's security forces will now be braced for attacks from either hardline \nJews or Palestinian extremists who will both seek to destroy the deal by \nprotest or violence even as it's born. (ITV, Lunchtime News, 23 October 98) \n165 \nIsraeli settlers had opposed the Oslo Accords for two reasons. The first involved \nthe claim that Israeli Jews had the right to settle anywhere in the occupied territories \nbecause the land were promised to their ancestors thousands of years ago by God. The \nsecond maintained that any return of land captured by Israel in the 1967 war would \nthreaten both their personal security and the security of the entire Israeli state. Both of \nthese arguments were represented in coverage. Journalists also discussed the power of \nsettler groups, their political opposition to the Oslo process and their attempts to \npressurise Netanyahu into not handing back any of the occupied territories. The \npotential threats to the security of Israeli settlers was emphasised by journalists \nvisiting the homes of settlers and discussing their fears. Settlers were also permitted to \nmake very contentious statements without being challenged by j ournalists as in two of \nthe examples below: \nMichael Kleiner- Knesset Member: I believe its a black day for Israel, a black \nday for the Jewish people if one knows history it reminds me of the days of the \nMunich agreement when Chamberlain came very happy with a piece of paper \nsigned with Mr Hitler and later on everyone found out it was a terrible \nmistake. (Channel 4 News, 23 October 1998) \nBenny Alon- Israeli Settler: BB Netanyahu established in this summit the \nPalestinian state and by this he risks not only the Jewish revival he risks the \nJewish state of Israel's survival. (BBC I Evening News, 23 October 1998) \nJewish settlers who held prayer demonstrations believe this land was given to \nthem by God and their homes and their families already heavily guarded will \nbe in danger if any more of it is turned over to the Palestinians. (BBC I \nEvening News, 23 October 1998) \nI was just at an Israeli settlement on the West Bank called Betel, they run the \nrisk of being virtually isolated, virtually cut off under this agreement. Not \nsurprisingly they are bitterly against it. (ITV Early Evening News, 23 October \n1998) \n166 \nPalestinian opposition to the Accords was motivated by many factors. \nProfessor Khalil Shikaki (1999), the fon-ner director of the Centre for Palestine \nResearch and Studies in the West Bank city of Nablus has argued that the \ndemographic transformation of the occupied territories had led to a substantial shift in \nPalestinian public opinion during the five years between Oslo and Wye. Shikaki \nreports that when the Oslo process began in 1993 support for the process stood at \napproximately two thirds of the population but that 'uncertainty about Israel's \nintentions and prospects for establishing a Palestinian state led most Palestinians to \nsupport both continued negotiations and violence against Israelis'. By early 1996 in \nthe wake of troop withdrawals support for the peace process had risen to 80 percent \nwhilst support for attacks on Israelis had fallen dramatically to about 20 percent of the \npopulation. Support for militant Islamic and nationalist groups also slumped by half to \nless than 20 percent of the population. However the election of Netanyahu as Prime \nMinister which led to a further expansion in settlement activity resulted in a \ndeterioration in all peace indicators by the time of Wye. Palestinian faith that the Oslo \nprocess would lead to the creation of a Palestinian state slumped to only 37 percent of \nthe population, whilst only 31 percent of the population believed that the two sides \nwould reach an agreement on final status issues. Support for violence against Israelis \nincreased dramatically to approximately 50 percent of the population and this support \nwas 'equally widespread among men and women of all age groups and educational \nlevels, and among residents of cities, villages, towns, and refugee camps, reflecting \ndeep anger about Israel's failure to honour its peace commitments'. Shikaki explains \nthat support for armed violence against Israelis was not seen as an alternative to the \npeace process but as tactic designed to prevent further Israeli land appropriations and \nsettlement building which in Palestinian eyes was making the proposed final status \nnegotiations largely irrelevant: \nPalestinian public opinion approved of diplomacy as a strategic choice while it \nsupported armed attacks as a tactical response to perceived Israeli \nintransigence and broken promises... rather than viewing violence as an \nalternative to diplomacy, some Palestinians regard[ed] violence as a \nsupporting tactic to improve the Palestinian negotiating position and to force \nIsrael to stop creating facts on the ground that prejudge[d] the outcome of \nnegotiations. (Shikaki, 1999) \n167 \nIn news coverage Palestinians who opposed the Oslo process were described as \n4extremists', 'militants' or 'terrorists': \nIn Gaza the extremist group Islamic Rhad demonstrated against any \ncompromise with Israel. They burnt a coffin meant to symbolise the peace \nprocess. The Palestinian Authority which controls Gaza has promised Israel \nthey will stop demonstrations like this and arrest people who attack Jews. \nSheik Ahmed Yassem the leader of Hamas, the other hard-line Islamic group, \nsaid the new agreement might obstruct them for a while but they would fight \nIsrael until freedom or martyrdom (BBC I Evening News, 23 October 1998) \nSo far its the extremists on both sides who've done most to make their views \non this agreement known. On the Gaza Strip Palestinian supporters of Islamic \nJihad marched in the white shrouds of suicide bombers. A speaker declared \nthat the struggle against Israel will continue. (ITV Evening News, 23 October \n1998) \nYasser Arafat also has to overcome his normal opponents. Sheik Yaseem the \nleader of the militant group Hamas said he would just ignore today's accord. \nAnti-agreement demonstrators were out in Gaza expressing their habitual \ndisapproval for the benefit of the cameras. But there is more than that \nprofound despair amongst most Palestinians who believe that after two years \nof foot dragging president Netanyahu can't be trusted. (Channel 4 News, 23 \nOctober 1998) \nIt might be asked whether it is appropriate top use a term like 'extremist' if half \nthe population supports such groups. The Channel Four journalist appears aware of \nthis, when she adds that there is 'profound despair amongst most Palestinians who \nbelieve that after two years of foot dragging president Netanyahu can't be trusted' but \nthis brief reference to the fact that scepticism to the peace process was widespread \namongst Palestinians isn't developed. Many of the Palestinian grievances were not \ncomplicated or difficult to present. It viewed the Israeli settlement building programs, \nhuman rights abuses and the removal of the Palestinian population from East \n168 \nJerusalem as the opposite of what the Oslo process was supposed to achieve. Many \nPalestinians and some Israelis believed that the end of the Oslo process would not \nresult in a viable sovereign Palestinian state but in the creation of Bantustans as used \nto exist in South Africa, a prediction that Hamas, Islamic Jihad the PFLP, and some \nPalestinian intellectuals, such as Edward Said, had made at the outset of the Oslo \nprocess in 1993 (see p. 113 -4). Shortly before the Wye Summit, Shlomo Ben-Ami, the \nIsraeli historian and Ehud Barak's chief negotiator at the 2000 Camp David talks, \nwrote that 'in practice, the Oslo agreements were founded on a neo-colonialist basis, \non a life of dependence of one on the other forever. ' The peace agreements were \ndesigned to impose on the Palestinians 'almost total dependence on Israel, ' creating \n4 an extended colonial situation. ' which is expected to be the 'permanent basis' for 'a \nsituation of dependence. '(Ben-Ami, 1998, cited in Carey, 2000: ). In this context \njournalists' descriptions of Palestinians who opposed what was occurring as 'devoted \nto wrecking the peace process' (BBC 1, evening news, 20 October 1998) or 'the \nenemies of peace' (BBC 1, lunchtime news, 24 October 1998) could sound \nincongruous. It highlights the lack of a critical informed edge in reporting, and the \ntendency ofjournalists to accept at face value the American perspective on the \nintegrity of the peace process. Alternative perspectives which questioned both the \nlegitimacy and trajectory of the peace process were not present in coverage. \nSourcing and Reported Statements \nHere I was interested in ascertaining whether there was an equivalence in the level of \ncoverage offered to Israeli and Palestinian sources, and whether journalists proffered \nthe perspectives of all sides equally when they reported statements from the different \nparties. To do this I tallied up the total space given to direct and reported statements \nfrom both sides. Three lines of direct statements would look like this: \nUzi Landau- Government MP: I believe that the minister has to halt these talks, go \nback home and make it clear to the Palestinians that we are prepared to negotiate with \nthem but only on condition that they are negotiating really for peace above the table, \nand not standing behind terrorism under the table. \n169 \nWhilst three lines of reported statements would look like this: \nJournalist: A spokesman for Mr. Netanyahu said that it really reinforced the need for \nIsrael to get strong and complete guarantees both in word and deed from the \nPalestinian side that they could control terrorism and they could provide security on \nthe West Bank. \nFigure 1. Lines of direct statements Provided by Israeli, Palestinian and American \nsources.. \nFigure 1. Lines of direct statements from different parties. \nBBC1 BBC2 ITV Channel 4 Channel 5 Total \nIsraeli 18 4 9 11 13 55 \nPalestinian 22 2 5 5 3 37 \nAmerican 37 7 13 8 3 68 \nOverall Israeli sources were given fifty per cent more space than Palestinians, though \nboth were eclipsed by American sources who were the most accessed particularly on \nthe mass audience bulletins on BBC I and ITV. Since the American representatives \ntended to support the Israeli positions this served to reinforce the imbalance in Israel's \nfavour. \nFigure 2. Reported statements from different parties \nBBC1 BBC2 ITV Channel 4 Channel 5 Total \nIsraeli 26 4 5 5 5 45 \nPalestinian 19 2 1 2 1 25 \nAmerican 9 7 0 6 0 23 \nThe reported statements shown in Figure 2 again show that Israeli statements are \noverall reported almost twice as much as statements by Palestinians, which are given \napproximately as much space as American ones. \n170 \n'Terrorism' and Descriptions of Violence \nThe choice of language is extremely important in indicating the social legitimacy, or \nlack of thereof \n, \nof different groups or positions. Terms used in conflicts, such as \n4soldier', 'rebel', 'militant', 'insurgent', 'freedom fighter', 'resistance fighter', \nýguerrilla' and 'terrorist' all imply different levels of social legitimacy and are likely \nto have important consequences for how viewers see those involved. In coverage \nimportant differences were evident in the terms employed to describe Palestinians and \nIsraelis. Israelis were described as 'soldiers', 'civilians', 'settlers', 'right wing \nsettlers', 'hardliners' and on one occasion, during a Newsnight broadcast, 'nationalist \nbigots and ultra-religious fundamentalists'. Palestinians were described as 'terrorists', \n41slarnic terrorists', 'militants'. 'Islamic militants', 'zealots', and 'hardliners'. \nJournalists from all channels except Channel Four described the Palestinians fighters \nopposing the occupation as 'terrorists'. This trend was Particularly noticeable on the \nBBC: \nYes even before this bomb attack this was always going to be the stumbling \nblock the reluctance of Israel to pull out of the West Bank, the 13 percent that \nthey are negotiating about until the Palestinian Authority can provide \nguarantees that they can control the terrorists and it seems that this is exactly \nthe sort of thing that Israel is dreading this sort of attack (BBC 1, Lunchtime \nNews, 19 October 1998) \nThe Middle East peace talks are in deep trouble tonight after a Palestinian \nterrorist hurled two grenades into a bus queue in Israel. (BBC 1, Evening News \n19 October 1998) \nThe Americans were frustrated that the Israelis were allowing that terror attack \nto shift the whole nature of these talks there were serious words between \nPresident Clinton and Benjamin Netanyahu about that last night. (BBC 1, Early \nevening, 20 October 1998) \n171 \nThe Israelis will withdraw troops from a further 13 percent of the West Bank. \nThey'll also release hundreds of Palestinians from Israeli jails. In return the \nPalestinians will adopt a security plan to arrest terrorists and crack down on \nanti-Israeli violence. (BBC I, Evening News, 23 October 1998) \nThe Middle East Peace talks are in serious difficulties tonight after a \nPalestinian terrorist hurled two grenades into a bus queue in Israel. (BBC2, \nNewsnight, 19 October 1998) \nA swap of more Palestinian land occupied by Israel since 1967 in return for \ntougher Palestinian measures against Islamic terrorists \n... \nIn both camps zealots \nwill do their damndest to bring down the peace process as it continues to \nunfold.

(Channel 5, Lunchtime News, 19 \nOctober 1998) \nBack in America President Clinton who has already spent 57 hours at the talks \nwaits in Washinton, hoping to be called back to the talks if the two sides can \nconclude a deal on land and terrorism (Channel 5 Lunchtime News, 20 \nOctober 1998) \nThere are a number of problems with j ournalists using the label terrorist. Firstly it is \nso emotive that it can serve to demonise the accused to such an extent, that it can \nobscure both motives and possible resolutions. The conflict clearly has underlying \npolitical dimensions that have to be resolved if there is to be a settlement. However if \njournalists use words like 'terrorist' the danger is that these can be lost and the \nsolution to the conflict get reduced to 'controlling the terrorists'. Amnesty \nInternational never use the words 'terrorism' or 'terrorist' in their literature (unless it \nis in inverted commas). Marie-Anne Ventoura an information officer for Amnesty \nInternational explained that this was partly because there was 'no internationally \nagreed definition of the term' (Email, 22 September 2004). She also claimed that \nAmnesty adopted the same reasoning as been taken by Ms Kalliopi Koufa, the Special \nRapporteur of United Nations Sub Commission on the Promotion and Protection of \nHuman Rights, who noted in 2001 \nthat the issue of 'terrorism' has been 'approached from such different \nperspectives and in such different contexts that it has been impossible for the \ninternational community to arrive at a generally acceptable definition to this \nvery day' The Special Rapporteur also points out that 'the term terrorism is \nemotive and highly loaded politically. It is habitually accompanied by an \nimplicit negative judgement and is used selectively. ' The Special Rapporteur \nunderscores the risk of mixing definitions with value judgements, which often \nleads commentators to qualify as 'terrorist' those acts they are opposed to, or \nto reject the use of the term when it relates to activities they support. (Email, \n22 September 2004) \n173 \nInstead of using the words 'terrorism' and 'terrorist' Amnesty specify when \ninternational human rights law has been violated and by whom. This is also more \nimpartial because it means that both state and non-state actors can be held to account \nwithout prejudice. This is perhaps a tactic thatjournalists could adopt. This points to \nanother problem in that there is a certain double standard in the way that human rights \nviolations are reported by the media. Whilstiournalists described Palestinian violence \nas 'terrorism'. Israeli 'security measures', at the this time being largely carried out by \nthe Palestinian Authority were described in very euphemistic language. However \nmany Palestinians regarded these measures as 'state terrorism' and some \ncommentators and human rights groups suggested that the Wye Memorandum would \nmake them worse: \nThe most significant and innovative aspect of the Memorandum is its barely \nconcealed call for state terror to achieve the goals of the US led program. That \nbreaks new ground for international agreements. The memorandum emphasizes \nthat the Palestinian security forces, which have a shocking record of torture and \nterror, must act to ensure the safety of Israelis. The CIA will supervise them as \nthey carry out arrests, hold mock trials, collect arms, and 'criminalise' incitement \nagainst the agreements. (Chomsky, 1999: xvii) \nChomsky points to an Amnesty International reports on a history of major human \nrights violations committed by security forces (both Palestinian and Israeli) during the \nOslo process: \nAmnesty International published an assessment of the human rights situation \nsince Oslo as the Wye Agreement was signed. Al estimates 1600 Palestinians \nroutinely arrested by Israeli forces every year, half 'systematically tortured'. AI \nnotes again as other major human rights organisations regularly have, that Israel \nis alone in having 'effectively legalised the use of torture' (with the Supreme \nCourt's approval), determining that in pursuit of Israel's perceived needs 'all \ninternational rules of conduct could be broken' AI reports similar practices on the \npart of the Palestinian Authority, including execution of two Palestinians for \n'incitement against the peace process'. The State Security Courts which conduct \nsuch abuses have been endorsed by the US State Department as demonstrating \n174 \n'Arafat's commitment to the security concerns of Israel' with the support of Al \nGore. (1999: xvii) \nThis appears to be a persistent feature of coverage. In their examination of \ncoverage of the Intifada, some two years later, Philo and Berry (2004) also found that \nnews media sometimes used very different language when describing the activities of \nthe two parties. Whilst the killing of two Israeli soldiers by Palestinians was \ndescribing using emotive language such as 'lynch mob' and 'murder', Israel \nlaunching rocket attacks from helicopter gunships on crowds of demonstrators was \nreported as 'Israel still wielded a big stick' (BBC 1,18: 00,4 October 2000). Some \nprint journalists have also accused the news media of using more euphemistic \nlanguage when referring to Israeli behaviour. Robert Fisk writing in the Independent \nnoted that when Israel captures Palestinian fighters they are often taken away by the \narmy and killed (17 April 2002). He points out that j ournalists, who are well aware of \nwhat is occurring, often refer to these actions as 'mopping up' exercises. \nAnother issue in relation to the use of language involved j ournalist's descriptions \nof the legal status of the West Bank and Gaza. In most instances journalists did \ndescribe the territories as being 'occupied'. However in three bulletins a BBC I \nreporter refers to the West Bank as being 'disputed' territory (BBC I Lunchtime, Early \nEvening & Evening News 19 October 1998). Channel Five journalists also referred to \nthe territories as 'disputed' on two occasions (Channel 5 Evening News, 23 October \n1998 & 24 October 1998). The distinction here is important, 'disputed' territory \nimplies that the legal ownership of the West bank and Gaza strip is unclear, whilst \n'occupied' indicates that the territory is Palestinian and the Israeli presence there is \nillegal. This seems strange since the official British government position (like almost \nall other governments) is that the territories are 'occupied', not 'disputed'. \nThis content analysis has pointed to a situation where j ournalists seem able to more \neasily present the Israeli perspective on most aspects of the conflict than the \nPalestinian perspective. In the next chapter I will examine why this might be so. \n175 \nChapter 4 \nProductions Factors in the Reporting of the Israel-Palestine Conflict \nYears of experience have taught me that one should never venture an opinion, favourable or unfavourable, on events concerned in any way with Israel. Any attempt \nat a detached view opens the wayfor letters, telegrams, personal exasperations and, \nabove all, telephone calls on what the late Sir Lewis Namier called 'the terror by \ntelephone. ' The only safe course is never, never, never to have any opinion \nwhatsoever on the Middle East. \nAJP Taylor, London Review ofBooks, 17 November 1982. \nHere I will relate the theoretical issues discussed in chapter one to the specific \nproblems encountered by j ournalists reporting on the conflict. \nTime Constraints, New Technologies and Commercial Pressures \nJournalists operate in a commercial and highly competitive environment in which \nthere are time constraints, which can make it a challenge to provide the necessary \nlevel of context or historical background. This is made all the more difficult for \njournalists when they are dealing with an area like the Israel-Palestine conflict which \nis uniquely controversial. Journalists have commented that it a challenge to provide \ncontext and background when time is short, and the historical record is fiercely \ncontested by the different Parties. The Channel 4j oumalist Lindsey Hilsum has \nsuggested that: \nThere are two problems \n... \nhow far back do you go is one and the other is with \na conflict like this, nearly every single fact is disputed \n... \nI think, I Oh God the \nPalestinians say this and the Israelis say that' and I have to, as a journalist\u0002make a judgement and I say this is what happened and it's quite clear and \nthere are other things where I wasn't there and I didn't see it with my own \neyes. I know it's a question of interpretation so I have to say what both sides \nthink and I think sometimes that stops us from giving the background we \nshould be giving, because I think well, bloody hell, I've only three minutes to \ndo this piece in and I'm going to spent a minute going through the arguments. \n(cited in Philo & Berry, 2004: 245) \n176 \nThe emergence of new technologies and television formats also seems to have \nhad important repercussions. The proliferation of new digital channels and in \nparticular the arrival of 24 hour news channels have been cited as important changes \naffecting the way journalistic operate. Some have argued that the proliferation of new \nchannels have meant that j ournalists now spread themselves more thinly, further \nreducing the time available for researching stories and providing context: \nPart of the problem is just the way the news medium works nowadays - where \nyou are geared up to having constant twenty-four hour news and you get the \nfeeling that some of the journalists on the spot are spending more time in front \nof a camera because they have to do fifteen different TV news programmes \nand four different radio programmes, than they are actually finding out what's \nhappening in the story, and that means we do not get as much analysis, as \nmuch colour, as much depth in what's going on. You get moment by moment \nrepetition. (Photographer, cited in Philo & Berry, 2004: 244) \nOthers have suggested that the advent of 24 hour news has meant that \ncontroversial views can be shunted to the margins of programme schedules where \nthey are unlikely to reach many viewers. The former BBC correspondent Tim \nLlewelyn has suggested that the BBC has marginalized the Palestinian perspective in \nthis manner: \nThe BBC can banish the awkward squads who might raise (or answer) real \nquestions about the Middle East to the watches that end the night. Critics who \nsay that the Palestinian or Arab view has not be aired can be referred to the \nWorld Service at 3.00am, or News 24 at 6: 00am, and so on. (Llewelyn, 2004: \n227) \nOthers have pointed to how the progressive relaxation of media regulation \nover the last two decades has affected the climate journalists operate in. Greg \nLanning, an experienced documentary producer, has argued that such regulatory \nchanges have led to the creation of a more competitive and rating driven broadcast \nculture, and that extended into all aspects of the schedule including news, current \n177 \naffairs and documentaries. Lanning maintains that even the BBC, which is supposed \nto be isolated from such commercial strictures, was under pressure to maintain at least \na 30 percent audience share in order to justify the licence fee, and this inevitably led \nprogrammers to seek material that was immediate and dramatic, at the expense of \nproviding context or analysis. Lanning also pointed to the effects of new media \nmonitoring technologies which allow broadcasters to ascertain the exact point in \nprogrammes when viewers switch channels: \nWe are coming under tremendous pressure to make the first five minutes of \nprogrammes quick, irresistible \n... \nWe always used to have hooks but now you \ncan't let the pace drop until you are well into the programme because they are \nreally scared that people will change channel. You should ask Channel 4 to \nshow you their meters. They can tell you where people leave the programme \nand where they go, and they do that for every program now. So they can tell \nyou that after 90 seconds you mentioned the Bosnian war and everyone went \nto Delia Smith or something. That's what is driving it [programme production] \n(Interview, Greg Lanning, 2 November 1999) \nThe BBC's George Alagiah has also spoken of the effects that such monitoring \nequipment has had at the Corporation's news service. Alagiah claims that according \nto the BBC's meters, approximately three million viewers change channel during the \nfirst minute of BBC I's early evening bulletin. This he suggests is why editors are \n4constantly' telling journalists that 'the attention span of our average viewer is about \ntwenty seconds' and that broadcasters must seek to 'grab' them with arresting \nmaterial (cited in Philo & Berry, 2004: 211). This in part explains the tendency for \nbroadcasters to emphasise the dramatic at the expense of the analytical. \nCultural Preference, Sourciniz and Public Relations \nMost international journalists covering the Israel-Palestine conflict are stationed in \nWest Jerusalem and have close links with the Israeli public relations machine. In \ncontrast, there are very few j ournalists stationed in the occupied territories. Tim \n178 \nLlewelyn suggests that makes it more difficult for reporters to understand the reality \nof military occupation and hence the Palestinian perspective: \nThe news people should move people out of West Jerusalem. It should base a \nnews team in the West Bank- not just some luckless stringer but a senior, \nknown correspondent who can force his or her way onto the main bulletins \n(what the BBC likes to call a 'brand' reporter). Here the reporters will get to \nfeel what daily life under occupation is like, live it and empathise with the \npeople crushed under it, as news crews lived the invasion of Baghdad or as we \nexperienced the Israeli invasions and occupation of Lebanon- from the inside, \nnot just down there on a visit. (2004: 229-23 0) \nHe also argues that the inability of journalists to cover the Palestinian \nperspective is partly a function of a cultural preference in that Israelis are seen as \ncloser culturally to Europeans, and partly because state actors with their attendant \nprestige and trappings are seen as more important and credible sources than the \nspokespersons of what is still a resistance movement: \nTo a westerner sitting at a screen in London a dead or suffering Arab in the \nrubble of a bazaar is more remote than a dead or suffering Israeli in a shopping \nmall with a Wal-Mart in shot; studios favour good English-speakers rather \nthan men with heavy accents; producers like quality sound and vision. It is a \npresenter's inclination, in many cases, to take more seriously a representative \nof a state and an authority, a uniform or a dark suit, than a denizen of what is, \nafter all, not quite a state but still a national revolutionary and resistance \nmovement, a man perhaps in a keffiyeh or a militia uniform, speaking in poor \nEnglish or being translated or subtitled. (2004: 229) \nA current senior BBC executive has also suggested that cultural preference plays a \nstrong role in how 'London-based British j ournalists who are not themselves Middle \nEast specialists' see the conflict. Their 'mind-set' he suggested could be: \nSummed up like this: (i) Israel is a liberal democracy, like the UK, with a free \npress, freedom of speech and frequent elections in which governments are \n179 \ndefeated; (ii) the Palestinians say their want their own state, they were offered \nit at Camp David and rejected it; (iii) throwing stones at tanks is one thing, but \nsuicide bombs on buses and in cafes is something else and places them beyond \nthe pale. (Letter, 9 July 2004) \nSome might question the characterisation of Israel as a 'liberal democracy like the \nUK' in light of reports produced by human rights groups and the United Nations. It is \nalso interesting that the executive claims that j ournalists were likely to blame the \nPalestinians for not accepting what was offered at Camp David. The events of Camp \nDavid are highly contested (see Philo & Berry, 2004: 83-86), but London based \njournalists, according to the BBC executive, appeared far more likely to accept the \nIsraeli perspective. Similarly the perspective on the use of violence is revealing. \nHuman rights groups have pointed to serious breaches of international law (including \nwar crimes and crimes against humanity) committed by both sides in the conflict but \nit seems that violence committed by Palestinians is viewed in a different light than \nthat committed by Israelis. \nIsrael also appears to have a most more developed public relations operation. \nA number of journalists have commented on the professionalism and effectiveness of \nthe Israeli PR machine. Jim Hollander, chief photographer for Reuters in Jerusalem \nhas remarked on how 'savvy' Israeli officials are in getting their side of the story \nacross to the foreign press corps: 'The Israeli officials are very literate and very \nprofessional in presenting their points of view and availing themselves to the media' \n(cited in el-Nawawy & Kelly, 2001: 102). Some journalists have also commented that \nthe Israeli PR machine operated by the Netanyahu administration was especially \nforceful in getting its views across. Lyse Doucet, a Canadian reporter for the BBC, \nnotes that the Israeli public relations machine is unrivalled in the Middle East and that \nBinyamin Netanyahu, whose background is in PR, is the 'ultimate spin-doctor' (cited \nin el-Nawawy & Kelly, 2001: 102). Likewise, Nicolas Tatro, the bureau chief for \nAssociated Press in Jerusalem, has commented that: \nEach Israeli government is different; they all flood us with information, but \nthis current government [the Netanyahu administration] has been more \naggressive in presenting its point of view. It very much has an edge to it. The \n180 \nrhetorical factor is much higher than it has been since the early days of the \nBegin govenunent. (cited in el-Nawawy & Kelly, 2001: 102) \nThis proactive approach involving 'flooding' journalists with infonnation \nemphasising your perspective, is not matched by anything comparable on the \nPalestinian side. Edward Said claims that during the Al-Aqsa intifada the Israeli \npublic relations operation was employing numerous proactive strategies to get the \nIsraeli message across, helped by many pro-Israel supporters in publishing and the \nwider media: \nNever have the media been so influential in determining the course of war as \nduring the Al-Aqsa Intifada \n... \nIsrael has already poured hundreds of millions of \ndollars into what in Hebrew is called hasbara, or information for the outside \nworld (hence, propaganda). This has included \n... \nlunches and free trips for \ninfluential journalists \n... \nbombarding congressmen- and women with invitations \nand visits; pamphlets and most important, money for election campaigns; \ndirecting (or, as the case requires harassing) photographers of the current \nintifada into producing certain images and not others \n... \ntraining commentators \nto make frequent references to the Holocaust and Israel's predicament today; \nmany advertisements in the newspapers attacking Arabs and praising \nIsrael \n... \nBecause so many powerful people in the media and publishing \nbusiness are strong supporters of Israel, the task is made vastly easier. (Said, \n2001) \nThe Independent's journalist Robert Fisk has also commented on how the \nproactive approach involving a constant flow of information from PR professionals to \njournalists can help to set news agendas: \nThe journalists' narrative of events is built around the last thing someone has \nsaid and the last thing, given the constraints of time and the rolling news \nmachine, that they have heard on the agency wire. So what you would find on \ntelevision in the last few weeks is that every time an Israeli statement was \nmade, it was pushed across at the Palestinians. So the Israelis would say: 'Can \nArafat control the violence? ' and instead of the television reporters saying: \n181 \n'Well that's interesting, but can the Israelis control their own People? ' the \nquestion was simply taken up as an Israeli question and became part of the \nnews agenda. There seemed to be no real understanding that the job of the \nreporter is to analyse what's really happening, not simply to pick up on the \nrolling news machine, the last statement by one of the sides. And given the \nfact that the Israelis have a very smooth machine operating for the media, \ninvariably what happened is, it was Israel's voice that came across through the \nmouths of the reporters, rather than [having] people who were really making \nenquiries into both sides and what both people were doing. (The Message \nBBC Radio Four, 20 October 2000, cited in Philo & Berry, 2004: 247) \nIn Britain the Israeli embassy has been a significant player in setting the media \nagenda. The Independent has reported that the 'Israeli embassy in London has \nmounted a huge drive to influence the British media', and cited comments from the \nembassy's press secretary that \nLondon is a world centre of media and the embassy here works night and day \nto influence that media. And in many subtle ways, I think we don't do a half \nbad job, if I may say so \n... \nWe have newspapers that write consistently in a \nmanner that supports and understands Israel's situation and its challenges. And \nwe have had influence on the BBC as well. (Independent, 21 September 2001, \ncited in Philo & Berry, 2004: 248) \nIn contrast some Zionists have argued that there are problems with Israeli public \nrelations. For instance Joy Wolfe of the Women's International Zionist Organisation \nhas commented on the 'inexperience' of representatives from the IDF who have 'very \npoor communications equipment and not even a proper speaking English translator \nwho can put out a decent press release' (cited in Philo & Berry, 2004: 246). However \nmost commentators suggest that that the Israelis are far more skilled in this \ndepartment than the Palestinians. A number of j ournalists have commented that the \nPalestinian public relations apparatus is amateurish and confused in comparison to the \nIsraeli operation. A US journalist who ran a Jerusalem based news agency commented \nthat: \n182 \nPalestinian spokesmen are their own worst enemy. They often come across as \nboorish, the message is often incoherent. Official Palestine does have a \nmethod problem. They miss the essential points. Arafat is a one man show,, \nhe is almost always incoherent. (cited in Philo & Berry, 2004: 246) \nPalestinian public relations also suffers from the disadvantage that the Israeli \nperspective is far more easily accessible through the English language versions of the \nIsraeli press, whilst little of the Arab press is available in English. As Dr Toine Van \nTeeffelen, a Dutch human rights worker who lives in Bethlehem notes: \nArab newspapers appear only in Arabic while some major Israeli newspapers \n(Jerusalem Post, Raaretz) appear in English, thus allowing for a daily stream \nof Israeli-oriented reports and analyses easily accessible through the internet. \nIn fact, most westernjoumalists are more familiar with the realities of \noccupation through the critical accounts of the Israeli Haaretz journalists \nAmira Hass and Gideon Levi than through accounts from the Palestinian or \nArab press. (Van Teeffelen, 2003) \nOther J oumalists have argued that the lack of a Palestinian perspective is not \njust a function of poor Palestinian public relations, but is also related to an \nunwillingness on the part of some broadcasters to prominently feature some of the \nmore articulate Arab spokespersons: \nThe BBC has been plied with list of suitable people by organisations such as \nthe Council for the Advancement of Arab-British Understanding, the Arab \nLeague, individual embassies and private people, only for these lists to be \nignored. Whether this is through inefficiency or deliberation, it is hard to say. I \ndo know for example that the Ambassador for the Arab League had, between \nJanuary 2003 and the end of the Iraq war in early April, appeared once on \nBBC TV; a colleague of mine who is one of Britain's most articulate and \nintelligent Palestinian spokespersons is missing almost completely from \nmainstream BBC television and rarely heard on domestic radio. (Llewelyn, \n2004: 224-5) \n183 \nThere does seem to be some evidence that Israeli public relations did set the \nmedia agenda, in the manner described by Fisk above, during the coverage of the Wye \nAccords. As already noted, there were essentially two explanations about why the \npeace process was stalled. The Netanyahu administration argued that the central \nproblem was that the Palestinians wouldn't control the 'terrorists' and disarm \nPalestinians. The Palestinian position was that the peace process was being \nmanipulated so as to allow the Israelis to take more land, build more settlements, and \neffectively re-package rather than end the military occupation. Whilst the official \nIsraeli perspective was featured extensively in reported statements, the Palestinian \nview was largely absent. \nPressure, Intimidation and Accusations of Anti-Semitism \nIn chapter one I discussed work by Mayhew and Adams which suggested that \nthe BBC was under intense pressure from Israeli officials and lobby groups during the \n1970s. Journalists have suggested that thirty years later little has changed. The BBC \nbureau chief in Jerusalem, Andrew Steele, has spoken of the extensive monitoring \ncapabilities of the official Israeli public relations operation and the pressure this can \ncreate: \nWe fairly regularly get an official summons from one side or the other to \nexplain our actions. I would say the frequency is higher on the Israeli side, but \nthat possibly is a reflection on the size and sophistication of their publicity \nmachine. They are able to monitor every single word that we say- someone \nsits at the Israeli Foreign ministry watching BBC World 24 hours a day. If \nthey ever have an issue about a story, they have a taped transcript of what we \nsaid and they can quote it back verbatim. They are completely open about this \nand even give tours of their monitoring facility. One person watches Sky \nNews, another CNN and another the BBC [the three international 24-hour \nnews channels broadcast in Israel]. We are very aware of the pressure. \n(Palestine-Israel Journal ofPolitics, Economics and Culture, 2003, vol. 10,2) \n184 \nSometimes the pressure can involve attempts to have journalists removed if \nthey produce critical coverage or fail to report stories which the Israeli press office \nwants covered. In April 2004 Chris McGreal reported on a letter sent by Natan \nSharansky, Israel's minister for Diaspora affairs to the BBC accusing Orla Guerlin of \nanti-Semitism and 'total identification with the goals and methods of the Palestinian \nterror groups' for questioning Israeli motives in their handling of a 16 year old would \nbe suicide bomber. He noted that this came at a time when a number of foreign news \nbureaus had complained about pressure from the Israeli press office: \nThe letter comes as several foreign news organisations complain of increasing \ngovernment pressure to curtail critical coverage or to report stories Israel \nbelieves help identify the Palestinian conflict with global Islamist terrorism. \nOfficials have presented editors with dossiers on individual reporters and \nsingled out organisations such as Sky News for allegedly having an anti-Israel \nagenda. The Tel Aviv press has called for the expulsion of correspondents \nfrom Sky, the Times and several French papers for failing to cover a story the \ngovernment mobilised embassies worldwide to get into the media last month. \n(Guardian, I April 2004) \nMcGreal also reported that 'CNN sources say the network has bowed to \nconsiderable pressure on its editors' and that 'Israeli officials boast that they now \nhave only to call a number at the network's headquarters in Atlanta to pull any story \nthey do not like'. This accusation was later denied by CNN. The BBC bureau chief in \nJerusalem, Andrew Steele has also spoken of the pressure that the corporation is under \nfrom organised lobby groups: \nThe pressure is enormous. And not just from our audiences in the UK. \nBecause the BBC is broadcast in Israel, the West Bank, Gaza and everywhere \nelse, every pressure group in the world is on our case. I have never had as \nmany emails as I get here. People don't just phone up to complain, they know \nhow to get their complaint noticed in a way that means we actually have to \naddress it, which is incredibly time-consuming. (Palestine-Israel Journal of \nPolitics, Economics and Culture, 2003, vol. 10,2) \n185 \nIn the United Kingdom there also exist a number of well resourced lobby \ngroups who attempt to influence the media agenda. The Britain Israel \nCommunications and Research Centre (BICOM) is one of the most prominent lobby \ngroups working in the United Kingdom. In its mission statement the organisation says \nthat its objective is 'to bring about a significant shift in opinion in favour of Israel \namongst the general public, opinion-formers and the Jewish community'. To achieve \nthis the organisation engages in numerous activities including 'operating a fully \nfunctioning media centre, providing real-time briefings and high quality in-depth \nresearch, publishing daily and weekly briefing of media coverage on Israel with \nanalysis, and organising and delivering visitor programs for key politicians, \nacademics and journalists' (BICOM website). In October 2002 Stephen Bates \nreported that BICOM had hired both Stanley Greenberg, former pollster and advisor \nto Bill Clinton, Tony Blair and Ehud Barak, and Frank Lunz, former advisor to \nGeorge Bush, Silvio Berlusconi, and Rudy Giuliani (The Guardian, 12 October \n2002). The report cited comments from Lee Petar, the acting director of BICOM, that \n4we are looking at ways to sharpen the message and to choose the right people to do \nit. To get the world's best professionals - and these are the world's best professionals - \nyou have to pay the top price. ' \nAll of Britain's three major political parties also have internal pro-Israel lobby \ngroups. The Labour Friends of Israel (LFI) claims to be 'one of the largest interest \ngroups within the Labour party' that can call on 'wide support from MPs, MEN and \nPeers' (LFI website). There is also the affiliated Trade Union Friends of Israel (TUFI) \nwhich arranges trips to Israel for trade union delegates. The organisation claims that \nits 'packed annual lunches at the TUC congress' were able to attract 'over 200 people \nand leaders of the largest trade unions and in particular TUC General Secretary John \nMonks' in 1997 (TUFI website). The Conservative Friends of Israel (CFI) claim to \nhave the support of many MPs including senior cabinet members, and argues that \n'much of the reason for this is due to the diplomatic and behind the scenes operation \nof CFI. ' The CFI organises many events at each year at the Houses of Parliament \ninvolving j ournalists, Peers, MPs and visiting dignitaries from Israel. The Observer \nreported that 'for those working for organisations perceived as being biased against \nIsrael these can be uncomfortable affairs'. Members of these lobby groups frequently \nclaim that the media is biased against Israel. For instance the Conservative MP Gillian \nShephard has argued that: \n186 \nLet's not suggest that Israel feels under siege. And it literally is. That is what \ndrives the feeling of ultra-sensitivity. They feel that there is a bias and there is \na conspiracy against them. There is a perception that Israelis are portrayed as \ninstigating the problems and that the historical context of the threat against \nthem is forgotten. There is a feeling too that Israel- which is a tiny island of \ndemocracy amid much less democratic neighbours- never gets enough credit \nfor what it has achieved. (Observer, 17 June 200 1, cited in Philo & Berry, \n2004: 250) \nOthers go further and claim that the media itself is anti-Semetic. The Daily \nMail columnist Melanie Phillips has repeatedly levelled this charge against the British \nmedia: \nCoverage of Israel is obsessive and disproportionate, and marked by a hysteria \nand malice not applied to any other conflict. And it cannot be divorced from \nthe overt Jew-hatred that has now surfaced in Britain and Europe, particularly \nthe give-away calumny of world Jewish power. The claim that Jews conspire \nto dominate the world is one of the oldest tropes of classic Jew-hatred. \nAstonishingly, claims made by the European Left are not far removed. It \nrepeats claims that the 'powerful Jewish lobby' is now running American \nforeign policy. (The Observer 22 February 2004) \nTim Llewelyn. has suggested that the BBC is particularly sensitive to \naccusations of anti-Semitism, and would rather avoid having to answer the charge. \nThe pressure from lobby groups, he maintains has led the corporation to tone down \nany criticism and avoid using terms like 'ethnic cleansing' which could generate \npressure: \nThey [the BBC] know that in the case of Israel the use of the term ethnic \ncleansing would bring down hell on their heads and the BBC are extremely \nnervous about Israel. They have a big bureau there, they've been threatened \nalready by the Israelis with being turfed out. They're under constant pressure, \nthe phones ring all the time, the Israeli lobby here know exactly who to ring \n187 \nand how to pester, how to persist and who to get at and of course people in \npositions like that, executives in public service corporations like the BBC are \nextremely nervous they don't like this and they don't want to be accused of \nanti-semitism however false the charge may be \n... \nand so they play it safe they \nplay it carefully. They are public servants and that's the way they respond. \n(Interview, 16 April 2004) \nJournalists have also been personally targeted for abuse by lobby groups. \nSome have spoken of the hate mail they receive, after they have written stories, \nquestioning Israeli policy. It has also been suggested that the quantity of hate mail \nreceived by j oumalists has increased greatly with the advent of electronic mail. The \nGuardian's reader's editor Ian Mayes has commented on the rise of the 'electronic \nlobby' and noted how organised email campaigns 'can mean two or three hundred \norganised emails piling into a queue in the paper in the space of a few hours and \nthreatening to clog up the works. ' (Guardian, 31 March 2001). He suggests these \norganised campaigns 'are perceived by most of those on the receiving end, not as the \nbearers of reasonable argument but as bullying and inhibiting to real debate. ' Mayes \npoints out that although there is an organised pro-Arab or pro-Palestinian lobby it 'is \nnot on anything like such a large scale' as the pro-Israel operation. The Independent \njournalist Robert Fisk has also spoken of the hate mail addressed to both himself and \nthe newspaper: \nThe Independent's web-site received an e-mail suggesting that I was a \npaedophile. Among several vicious Christmas cards was one bearing the \nlegend of the 12 Days of Christmas and the following note inside: 'Robert \nFiske (sic) - aka Lord Haw Haw of the Middle East and a leading anti-semite \n& proto-fascist Islamophile propagandist. Here's hoping 2002 finds you deep \nin Gehenna (Hell), Osama bin Laden on your right, Mullah Omar on your left. \nYours, Ishmael Zetin. '... Almost anyone who criticises US or Israeli policy in \nthe Middle East is now in this free-fire zone. My own colleague in Jerusalem, \nPhil Reeves, is one of them. So are two of the BBCs'reporters in Israel, along \nwith Suzanne Goldenberg of the Guardian. (Independent 14 May 2002) \n188 \nIn these campaigns Jews who criticise Israel appear to have been subjected to \nparticular abuse. In early 2004 Brian Whitaker reported on the case of Deborah Fink, \na singer and music teacher living in London. Fink, who was a member of Just Peace \nUK, a predominately Jewish group which campaigns for an end to the Israeli \noccupation and the creation of an independent Palestinian state, had organised an \nalternative Christmas carol concert in which traditional carols were sung with new \nwords, some questioning the occupation. There followed a 'deluge of hateful emails': \nOne came from a rabbi in New York, informing her: 'Your soul, my dear, is \npetrified and lost. ' Another said, menacingly: 'Hitler killed the wrong Jews. ' \nYet another - ostensibly from a Jewish doctor of medicine in the US \n- \nelaborated on the Holocaust theme. 'Too bad Hitler didn't get your farnily, ' it \nsaid. 'With six million Jews dieing [sic] 60 year [sic] ago it's a shame scum \nlike you somehow managed to survive. ' (Guardian, 19 January 2004) \nMany of the letter writing campaigns are organised via the internet by activists. One \norganisation honestreporting. com, which claims to have 12,000 subscribers, has \nclaimed that its letter writing campaigns have directly influenced newspaper \ncoverage. After the Evening Standard art critic Brian Sewell had written an article \ncalling on Israel to 'become a multicultural society' and stop using the Holocaust to \njustify unacceptable behaviour, honestreporting. com mounted a campaign. 'The next \nday, [we] sent out a letter to subscribers. ' Standard articles recorded 'a wave of \ncomplaints... hundreds of Jewish readers have written in'. Then 'after more pressure' \nthere followed a pro-Israel article by Simon Sebag-Montefiore. 'This is an example of \nwhat we can do. ' (cited by David Leigh in the Guardian, 22 February 200 1). Other \nattempts to influence the media agenda have been carried out in a more subtle \nmanner. David Hirst has written of the Middle East Media Research Institute (Memri) \nwhich distributes its Arab and Jewish translations from the Middle East to thousands \nofjournalists, diplomats, politicians and activists. The organisation which presents \nitself as an impartial translation service is run by Colonel Yigal Carmon, a former \nadvisor on terrorism to two former Israeli prime ministers, and half Memri's staff are \nformer Israeli intelligence agents. Hirst notes that Memri is highly selective in its \n189 \nchoice of translations choosing the most 'rabid and outrageous' anti-western and anti\u0002semetic, statements from Arab speakers. Hirst claims that that Memri never produces \ntranslations of extreme statements from fundamentalist Jewish groups and that 'its \ntendentious choice of material casts the Arab world in a much worse light than that \ndiscourse taken as a whole could reasonably justify' (2003: 77). \nPress Coverage \nMany studies examining the operation of broadcast news organisations have \nnoted that much news gathering is not proactive but structured around various pre\u0002determined routines. For instance all news organisations utilise what is know as a \ncnews diary' where significant future events such as state visits, elections, legislation, \nand the release of official reports are pre-logged and anticipated. Similarly what \nappears in the broadsheet press is also important in determining the content of \ntelevision news. If a story or perspective is reported in the broadsheets it acts as a \nmarker highlighting it as a potential area of coverage for television news. It also \nimparts the story or perspective with a sense of legitimacy and credibility. If it has \nbeen reported in the broadsheets it becomes a story 'worth covering'. Conversely if a \nstory or perspective has not been covered by the broadsheet press, it may be more \ndifficult for aj ournalist to convince his editor that it is a legitimate piece of news. As \nthe Glasgow Media Group have noted: \nTwo other key factors in routine journalistic practice are the general reliance \non the press to define the parameters of an 'acceptable' story plus the reliance \non news services such the Press Association to supply a large amount of basic \nnews material. Journalists in television news to whom we spoke complained of \nthe difficulties of initiating news stories unless something like them had \nalready appeared in the press. Attempts by j ourrialists to initiate new themes \nwere met by the question, 'where are the press cuttings on this? ' (Glasgow \nMedia Group, 1985: 2) \nThere have been claims in the media that the two highest circulation British \nbroadsheets employ editorial policies which are strongly supportive of Israel, and that \n190 \njournalists have been discouraged from airing the Palestinian perspective. In \nSeptember 2001 Sam Kiley aj ournalist at The Times resigned from the publication, \nclaiming that his reports had been subject to pro-Israeli censorship. In an interview in \nthe Evening Standard he pointed to the friendship between Rupert Murdoch and Ariel \nSharon and the press baron's extensive investments in Israel. He maintained that this \nled executives to rewrite copy so as to be favourable to Israel: \nThe Times foreign editor and other middle managers flew into hysterical terror \nevery time a pro-Israel lobbying group wrote in with a quibble or complaint \nand then usually took their side against their own correspondent (cited in The \nGuardian, 5 September 2001) \nHe also claimed that he was told 'not to refer to 'assassinations' of Israel's \nopponents, nor to 'extra-j udicial killings or executions'. On one occasion when he \ninterviewed an Israeli army unit responsible for killing a 12 year old Palestinian boy, \nhe claimed that he was told to file the report without mentioning the dead boy. He \nconcluded that 'no pro-Israel lobbyist ever dreamed of having such power over a great \nnational newspaper'. \nSimilar claims have been made in relation to Britain's highest circulation \nbroadsheet, The Daily Telegraph. In a letter to the Spectator, three writers from \nConrad Black's Telegraph group argued that Mr Black's strong pro-Israeli views \nmade it impossible for any journalist to cover the Palestinian perspective (cited in the \nGuardian, 16/3/2001). They pointed to a strongly worded attack by Black on a \nSpectator journalist who had criticised Israel, as well as a blanket condemnation of \nthe Independent, Guardian and BBC, who according to Black were guilty of \npropagating pro-Palestinian propaganda. The writers argued that such attacks made it \ndifficult for editors or j ournalists on his publications to air opposing views. \nLack of Specialist Knowledge \nTo produce critical informed journalism requires journalists with a deep \nknowledge of the issues they are writing about. However in an area such as the \nIsraeli-Palestine conflict, which is complicated and contested, it has been suggested \n191 \nby a senior BBC executive that many of the Corporation's London based joumalists \nmay lack a firm grounding in the history of the conflict, and that this can adversely \naffect coverage: \nMy hunch is that you would find that many of the words, phrases, etc that \nreflect either ignorance or lack of balance were written in London, rather than \nby correspondents in the field. It might be an interesting exercise one day to \nseek to analyse the historical knowledge and understanding of TV newsroom \nwriters and sub-editors, which I fear may not always be much greater than that \nof the viewers in your focus groups. On a matter of weeks ago, a senior BBC \nprogramme editor asked me if I could recommend a good Middle East history \nbook, as how felt he had an inadequate grasp of the issues and background. \n(Letter, 9 July 2004) \nThis certainly seems to back up the comments made by Kevin Williams in \nchapter one concerning the need for j ournalist training to incorporate in its remit some \nknowledge of world politics and history. If senior editors are worried about their grasp \nof one of the most covered stories in international news, this is likely to present \nproblems. \nBritain's 'SDecial RelationshiD' with the United States \nThough it is sometimes argued that the Foreign Office is more pro-Arab than Israeli, \nthe close political, economic and diplomatic links between the US and Britain, often \nreferred to as 'the special relationship', are likely to have an effect on how j ournalists \nreport the conflict. There was little in the coverage of the Wye Accords about the \nmore controversial aspects of America's role in the conflict, such as its financing and \ndiplomatic support for settlement building in the occupied territories. There was also \nno information about its supply of weaponry to Israel, much of which is provided free \nof charge. More recent research examining news coverage of the Al-Aqsa intifada \nalso found that journalists tended to avoid discussing the more controversial aspects \nof America's role in the conflict (Philo & Berry, 2004). This appeared to leave \nviewers confused about motives. For instance, few understood that Palestinians might \n192 \nbe hostile to American involvement, because the US supplies Israel with weapons. \nPhilo and Berry also found that 'even those people who were concerned about how \nmuch explanation could be included in news programmes said that this was 'the least' \nthey should be told (2004: 211). \nSo why do journalists avoid discussing the 'American connection'9 Previous \nresearch suggests that the tone of BBC journalism is partly shaped by pressures \nfiltering in from senior politicians. In his ethnography of BBC news gathering in the \n1970s Philip Schlesinger (1978) examined how the Corporation's news output was \nideologically tuned to conform to British foreign policy, through the editorial system \nand the vetting of personnel. The corporation, which had always had close links with \nM15, employed an ex-army officer Ronnie Stonham, whose task was to weed out \njournalists with 'subversive' views who were then blacklisted. The vetting process \nwas conducted in strict secrecy with no right of appeal (see also 'Revealed how M15 \nvets BBC staff, The Observer 18 August 1985). Schlesinger also revealed how the \nminutes of meetings involving senior editors and the Director General demonstrated \nthe pressures feeding into the top BBC hierarchy from politicians and organised lobby \ngroups. Decisions taken in response to these pressures were then diffused downwards \nthrough the editorial system. Schlesinger notes that this top-down system of control is \nrarely perceived in this way by j ournalists because of a desire to maintain an image of \nautonomy and because decisions taken by upper management become taken up as \npersonal decisions by those lower down the hierarchy. Coverage of certain 'sensitive' \nareas such Northern Ireland or official secrets were delegated to senior sub-editors \nwho had shown conformity and could be trusted as a 'safe pair of hands'. In contrast \nthose who took controversial positions such as a sub-editor 'who had insisted on \ndamning the American presence in Vietnam' were subject to a range of official or \nunofficial sanctions (1978: 15 1). \nTim Llewelyn suggests that the BBC will have picked up on New Labour's \nattitude towards the conflict, and shaped the 'tone of its correspondents' and \nreporters' coverage, and its presenters' and producers' attitudes accordingly: very \ncautiously, in lockstep as close as can be with the government and the policymakers at \nNo. 10 Downing Street' (2004: 228) \nIt is no secret that Blair is very close to Israel. His old crony and party \nfinancier, Lord Levy, has been rewarded with the post of special adviser on \n193 \nMiddle East matters. Lord Levy is a peer who has close contacts with Israel \nand a multi-million pound villa near Tel Aviv- his son David Levy worked in \nthe office of Israel's former Justice Minister Yossi Beilin... The Blair vision \nof the Middle East- that the Americans have all the answers, but need a little \ngentle coaxing from Whitehall, that the Israelis are victims of terror, and \n'terror' is our main universal enemy, that the Palestinians are their own worst \nenemies and must do what they are told- will have been sensed at the BBC and \npassed on down the line \n... \nThe process of getting the boys in the front-line into \nline does not work by diktat from above but by hint and nudge and whispered \nword, almost, in such a very English way by extra-sensory perception (2004: \n225-226) \nThe pressures that I have highlighted in this chapter have not created a situation where \nno criticism of Israel is possible in the media. Critical documentaries such as Channel \nFour's The Killing Zone (19 May 2004) and BBC's reports on Israel's nuclear \nweapons (Correspondent, 17 March 2003) and the Sabra and Shatilla killings \n(Panorama June 17,2001) continue to be made and broadcast. However the complex \nmixture of economic, political and cultural factors indicated above do help to explain \nwhy journalists tend to find it easier to present the Israeli perspective. \n194 \nChapter 5 Conclusions \nSix months after the start of the September 2000 al-Aqsa intifada Harpers magazine \nfeatured an article examining the public relations strategy employed by the Israelis. \nThe piece featured comments from the Israeli government spokesperson Nachman \nShai and Danny Yatom, the national security advisor under Ehud Barak. The title of \nthe article was 'Fighting the Media War' and in it Shai commented that: \nPrior to the Shann el-Sheikh summit I put together a committee of ten to \ntwenty Israelis to Plot our media strategy in the United States. And I told \nthem: we are losing the media battle and it is our job to put each of you on \ntelevision to call the Palestinians liars. We have to win the media war to win \nthe larger war. We designated one week for planning, rebutting the Palestinian \nposition, and giving assignments to people. These were the top people - \nItamar \nRabinovich, Peres's top aides, former Rabin people, you name it \n- and we \ngave out assignments. Our purpose was to turn around American public \nopinion. We were very fortunate, because we aimed at putting our strategy \ninto effect at Sharm el-Sheikh. And we succeeded, but like I said we were \nlucky. There were no Palestinian media people at Sharm el-Sheikh, and so we \nhad the American media to ourselves. We gave interview after interview and \nthey [the Palestinians] were very under-staffed. We should not underestimate \nour victory, in many ways, the media war will decide who is wrong and who is \nright in this struggle, and we must convince people that we are right. We have \nsome major problems with the American media. There are many media outlets \nthat understand our position, but there are others that are completely against \nus. We are especially upset at CNN. They have two Palestinian reporters, and \nthey are very anti-Israeli. And we are putting real pressure on the heads of \nCNN to have them replaced with more objective pro-Israeli reporters who are \nwilling to tell our side of the story. You know the importance of the media in \nmolding public opinion, so we need you cooperation. We need our friends in \nthe United States to counter the Palestinian allegations. We need to get our \nstory out. (Harpers Magazine, May 2001) \n195 \nShai's comments reiterate some of the important themes and issues long highlighted \nby media researchers in discussions over the power and influence of the mass media. \nThese include the importance of systematic propaganda and public relations as well as \nthe significance of attempts to intimidate and pressure media outlets to toe a particular \nline. Shai certainly sees the public relations campaign as vital as evidenced by his \ncomment that 'we have to win the media war to win the larger war'. The media thus \nserve as a site of ideological struggle where parties seek to win public consent for \ntheir own policies and perspectives, as well as to degrade the arguments of their \nopponents. In the midst of these propaganda wars stand j ournalists and news \norganisations whose job is it to somehow pick their way amongst the minefield of \ncompeting explanations and simplify a fractious and complicated reality for the \nviewers at home. The purpose of this research was to address how i ournalists \napproached this task when reporting on the Wye River Peace Accords signed in \nOctober 1998. Although the Oslo peace process was widely seen to be in crisis there \nwere a whole series of competing explanations for the breakdown. The Israeli \ngovernment stressed that the problems were related to 'terrorism' and the failure of \nthe Palestinian Authority to prevent incitement and attacks against Israelis. The \nPalestinian delegation, on the other hand, were keen to stress that they had grave \ndoubts about Israeli intentions. As one delegate interviewed on BBC I had put it 'it is \nvery clear there is no commitment to a genuine peace and that the process is being \nmanipulated to continue Israeli control and to undermine Palestinian rights' (BBC 1, \nEvening News, 19 October 1998). There was also the position of the various groups \nboth Israeli and Palestinian who opposed the Oslo process for a variety of reasons, \nand the somewhat ambiguous position of the United who was ostensively acting as a \npeacemaker. \nThe results of the content analysis reported in chapter three indicated that there \nwas a strong emphasis, especially on BBC I, on the security concerns of the Israelis at \nthe expense of reporting on issues which were important to Palestinians. The \nPalestinian view that the security issue was being used to avoid returning occupied \nland, although expressed by Palestinian sources when given an opportunity to speak, \nwas not picked up and elaborated on by journalists. In contrast the Israeli argument \nthat the central problem was the Palestinian failure to curb 'terrorism' was frequently \npicked up on and explained to viewers. Palestinian 'terrorism' was presented by \njournalists on a number of occasions as the 'key issue' or 'stumbling blocking' to the \n196 \nattainment of a peace agreement. Furthermore the highly controversial aspects of the \n6 security clampdown' which were heavily criticised by human rights groups at the \ntime were not highlighted by j ournalists. The central issues for Palestinians including \nending the occupation, curbing human rights abuses and resolving the status of \nJerusalem and the future of the refugees were barely mentioned in coverage. This also \nties in closely with previous research (Philo & Berry, 2004; Ackerman, 2002; \nLowestedt & Madhoun 2002; Chomsky, 2000,1999,1996a, 1996b, 1993,1992, \n19919 1988; Mayhew and Adams, 1975). Compounding this problem was the absence \nof historical context or information about the origins of the conflict in news bulletins. \nAll of the major issues: Jerusalem, the military occupation, the settlements, refugees \netc. are tied in to the events of 1948 and 1967. Without any knowledge of what \noccurred in these years it is very difficult to understand the motivations of Israelis and \nPalestinians. As Lindsey Hilsum noted in chapter four this is made especially difficult \nwhen the historical record is so fiercely contested and j ournalists are working under \ntime constraints. \nAnother finding from the research was that j ournalists presented only one \nview of the peace process. This was that Israelis and Palestinians, helped along by Bill \nClinton, were striving to reach a peace agreement but that extremists on both sides \n(the 'enemies of peace' BBC 1, lunchtime news, 24 October 1998) threatened to \ndestroy their good work. However this was not how the peace process was regarded \nby many Palestinians, perhaps the bulk of the population. Some time after Wye the \nIsraeli j ournalist Danny Rabinowitz reported in the Israeli press on a letter send by \nPalestinian leaders, illustrating the gap between mainstream depictions of the peace \nprocess and how many Palestinians saw it: \nOne view, which is accepted by the majority of Israelis, considers Oslo a \npositive, symmetric process: an elected government in Israel is conducting \npeace negotiations with a Palestinian leadership that reflects the true interests \nof the Palestinian people. Pursuing this joint path will ultimately lead to a \ndurable peace between the two peoples. The second view, which is asserted by \nthe signatories to the letter, considers Oslo an inherently asymmetric process \nwhose forgone conclusion is not only unfair, but also dangerous. The gist here \nis that Israel, which is strong, big, rich and backed by a superpower, is \n197 \nconducting negotiations of a coercive nature with a weak Palestinian \nleadership that has sold out. (Haaretz, 19 March 2000) \nSome Palestinians viewed the peace process as likely to lead not to an equitable \nsettlement but to the creation of a series of South African style Bantustans, a \nprediction made at the outset of Oslo in 1993 (see p. 113-4), and the belief gained \nmore adherents with Israeli moves to change the demographics of the West Bank over \nthe next five years. These included the doubling of the settler population, the seizure \nof more than 40 percent of the West Bank, and the creation a matrix of Israeli only \nroads across the West Bank which effectively cantonised the area and made it difficult \nfor Palestinians to move any distance. It also severely damaged the economy. \nJournalists on a number of occasions spoke of the anger and frustration felt by \nPalestinians but did not, apart from on a single occasion, mention these major \ndemographic changes that were generating resentment. This pattern of presenting \nPalestinians as motivated by hate or anger without explaining the factors behind their \nresentment was also found by Ackerman (2002) and Philo and Berry (2004) in their \nanalyses of the al-Aqsa intifada. \nThe letter cited above by Rabinowitz also points to the remarkably ambivalent \nattitude between Yasser Arafat and the Palestinians in the occupied territories. \nArafat's Palestinian Authority had been accused of corruption and human rights \nabuses and some Palestinians doubted that Arafat could be trusted to negotiate a fair \nsettlement. In fact he had been declared a 'collaborator' by a number of prominent \nPalestinians including Edward Said (1996). More than a year before the Wye \nagreements the Israeli journalist Tanya Reinhardt had written in the Israeli press: \nAt the eve of the Oslo agreement, the PLO was in a serious crisis, whose \ncentre was a growing resentment of Arafat's leadership, There were many \nreports in the press of public gatherings in the West Bank denouncing the lack \nof democracy, the dissociation of the Tunis group from the reality of \noccupation, and, especially, the complete control Arafat had over the budget \nand the finances. Arafat may have felt that the way to regain control is a \nsweeping agreement with Israel. Today it is already a public knowledge that in \nthe circles of Rabin, the idea was formed that under these circumstances, it \nmay be possible to extort Arafat into a complete surrender. The process in \n198 \nwhich a brave national leader becomes a pathetic collaborating ruler, like \nLahad of South Lebanon, is complex, but with a fixed script of pressure and \nbribery. (YediotAharonot, 4 July 1997) \nHowever in news bulletins the only issue appeared to be whether Arafat could \n4control the terrorists' amongst his people. This is certainly the official Israeli \nperspective. The lack of a more balanced account of how Arafat and the Oslo \nagreements were perceived by Palestinians was partly a result of the restricted range \nof sources used by j oumalists. As already noted Israeli and American sources were \ngiven more television access than Palestinian sources and their perspectives were \nmore likely to highlighted by j oumalists in the form of reported statements. \nPalestinian authority officials were the only Palestinians interviewed, apart from a \nsingle bulletin in which a young Palestinian mentioned that he couldn't move freely, \nand a reported statement from a Hamas leader who declared that the Palestinians \n'would fight Israel until freedom or martyrdom'. The same was true in relation to \nIsraelis interviewed by journalists. Israeli officials were most featured, followed by \nsettlers and on one occasion Channel Four featured a representative of a British pro\u0002Israel lobby group. The range of Israeli and Palestinian public opinion is much \nbroader than this. Israel has a number of well developed peace and human rights \norganisations such as Meretz, Peace Now, Gush Shalom, Rabbis for Human Rights, \nB'Tselem and the Israeli League for Civil and Human Rights. However none of these \nwere interviewed or featured in news reports. A brief interview with a member of an \nIsraeli peace group might have offered a very different picture of the peace process. \nFor instance nine months before Wye, Gush Shalom published a report on the \nprogress of the Oslo process which was very different from anything featured in \nBritish news broadcasts: \nThe Netanyahu government has stopped the peace process and threatens to \nbury it altogether, putting all the blame on the Palestinians. It asserts that, \nwhile Israel has faithfully fulfilled all the provisions of the agreements, the \nPalestinians have systematically violated them. The Israeli media, nearly \nwithout exception, are aiding and abetting this propaganda. However, the facts \nare quite different: while the Palestinian violations are few and quite marginal, \nas clearly emerges from the pathetic document composed by government \n199 \nsecretary Danny Naveh, the contraventions by the Netanyahu government are \nsystematic and substantial. (Gush Shalom, 1998) \nThis reliance on a narrow selection of powerful institutional sources appears a \nconsistent feature of coverage in this area. Research conducted on the al-Aqsa intifada \nalso found that official sources were routinely over-accessed in bulletins and this \neffectively meant that there was a wider level of debate featured in the Israeli media \nthan on British television (Philo & Berry, 2004). Similarly the image of Israeli settlers \nalso replicated the findings of Philo and Berry (2004). These tended to be presented as \nvulnerable to attacks from Palestinians, though j ournalists didn't explain why their \npresence might be resented by Palestinians. There was no mention that settlers had \nbeen censured by the UN and human rights groups for attacking Palestinians and \ntaking their land, or that their presence in the occupied territories is considered by \nmost countries as illegal under international law. \nAmerica's role in the peace process was also more contradictory than it appeared in \ncoverage. Journalists presented an image of an American president working hard to \nbring two bitter enemies together and forge a peace. One j ournalist even questioned \nwhether the pressure from the Americans had been so great that it might lead to a \nfracture in the relationship between Israel and the United States. However such \ncoverage tends to overlook the fact that many members of the pro-Israel lobby were in \nsenior positions in the Clinton administration including the two men who headed \nClinton's Middle East negotiating team, Martin Idynk and Dennis Ross, both \nmembers of AIPAC, the most powerful pro-Israel lobby group in American politics. \nSome might also consider it contradictory to emphasise the American role as \npeacemaker whilst neglecting to mention that the US was arming one side, as well as \nproviding economic and diplomatic support for settlement building, which many \nPalestinians thought was undercutting the possibility of a just settlement. Chomsky \nhas argued that whilst reporting the conflict American journalists tend to accept at \nface value whatever the US claims to be doing, such as supporting peace, even when \nit may be actually carrying out policies which undermine that goal: \nThe most interesting element of the doctrinal framework is the notion of \n'peace process' itself. That the U. S. and its Israeli partner have always sought \npeace is not in question: everyone seeks peace, even Hitler, Stalin, and Attila \n200 \nthe Hun. The question is: what kind of peace? In U. S. discourse, the term \n6peace process' is conventionally used to refer to whatever the U. S. \ngovernment happens to be doing, often undermining diplomatic efforts. That is \ndramatically true in the present case. For 25 years, the U. S. has stood virtually \nalone in rejecting two basic principles of the international consensus on a \npeace settlement: that Israel withdraw from the occupied territories in \nexchange for peace, and (from the mid 1970s) that Palestinian national rights \nbe recognized in the West Bank and Gaza. (I 996b) \nHowever the close political, economic and military ties between Britain and the \nUnited States, meant that it was always unlikely that j ournalists themselves would \nquestion the dominant American perspective on what was occurring. As Philo and \nBerry have noted to 'explain in detail the rationale of those who oppose US policy is \nto court controversy. It is simpler to avoid explanations or to leave them to the \nmargins of television and radio' (2004: 107). The problem with this approach is that \nviewers are likely to receive a partial and sometimes misleading account of events. \nA final point to make about coverage was the tendency for journalists on all channels \nexcept Channel Four to go beyond merely reporting the Israeli perspective on \n'Palestinian terrorism'. but to actually endorse it. Groups such as Amnesty \nInternational have suggested, that the use of the expressions 'terrorism' or 'terrorist' \ncan create problems. The organisation's view is that the terms are imprecise, emotive, \npolitically loaded and employed selectively. For instance some Palestinians regard a \nnumber of Israeli actions such as extra-judicial killings and torture as 'state terrorism' \nbut j ourrialists, do not endorse or even report on this perspective. An alternative course \nof action would be for j ournalists to report but not to endorse the use of such terms, \nand indicate when international law has been violated. This approach is more \nimpartial and allows for a clearer legal and moral accounting. \nNews Coverage and Public Belief \nThe results from the content analysis indicated that television news was largely \ndevoid of history and context, featured a preponderance of official Israeli perspectives \nat the expense of providing the Palestinian point of view, and tended to avoid \nexplaining the ambivalent and contradictory position of the United States. How might \n201 \nsuch coverage influence public knowledge in this area and can direct parallels be \ndrawn between how the conflict is presented by journalists and how it is understood \nby viewers? Focus group and questionnaire research reported by Philo and Berry \n(2004) suggests there is evidence that it can. The authors found that television news \nwas the key site on information about the conflict for over 80 per cent of those \nquestioned and that those who were comparatively well informed (and tended to come \nfrom middle-class and professional backgrounds) augmented their knowledge of the \nconflict by reading books and broadsheet newspapers. Some viewers interviewed \nwere openly disparaging about the lack of context in television news. One commented \nthat: \nThere is no depth to it \n- \ntelevision news more or less covers everything \nsuperficially. I think we are dumbing down. Someone has told the BBC that \nthe average person has an attention span of less than two minutes and that is \nrubbish but they are buying into it. More and more it's all about 'How can we \nkeep them watching - whether we are giving information or not? ' I certainly \nwouldn't rely on BBC television news for anything that I though was really \nimportant. (Middle class male focus group, cited in Philo & Berry, 2004: 210) \nSome news editors have reacted defensively to accusations that television news fails \nto provide enough context when reporting on the conflict. For instance Roger Mosey, \nthe head of BBC television news has argued that too much is expected of the medium: \nTelevision is still the dominant medium of our age, and 36 million people a \nweek watch BBC news. But if you printed a transcript of the Ten O'Clock \nNews it would not fill one page of a newspaper like this: it is, inevitably, a \nbrief digest of the day's events with as much analysis as we can manage. For \nthe complete background you may need to go to a website or a newspaper or a \nbook \n... \nnews is an account of the world as it is and not as we want it to be, and \ntelevision news is a starting point for our exploration of it and not the last \nword. (Guardian, 27 July 2004) \nIn an ideal world people most people might seek out information from alternative \ninformation sources but for the great bulk of the population television news remains \ntheir primary window on the world. This can be seen very clearly by comparing the \n202 \nlack of context in news bulletins to audience understandings of the key events and \nissues in the conflict. The absence of historical background found in television news \nreports was strongly mirrored in the audience research studies. Philo and Berry (2004) \nfound that few viewers were aware of the historical origins of the conflict or could \nname any of the region's wars. In the focus groups only 19 per cent were aware that \nthe Palestinian refugees were related to the establishment of the state of Israel in \n1948. The lack of historical knowledge made it very difficult for viewers to \nunderstand the key issues in the conflict. So for instance, whilst a number of viewers \nexpressed the opinion that 'land' was an issue, in practice there was a great deal of \nconfusion about what this actually signified. One viewer expressed his surprise that \nthe Palestinians had actually had land taken from them in the conflict: \nThe impression that I got was that the Palestinians had lived around that area \nand now they were trying to come back and get some more land for \nthemselves -I didn't realize that they had actually been driven out, I just \nthought that they didn't want to live as part of Israel, and that the places they \nwere living in they decided they wanted to make self-govemed -I didn't \nrealize that they had been driven out in wars previously. (Student group, \nGlasgow, cited in Philo and Berry, 2004: 216) \nWhat this illustrates is that without some kind of understanding of a narrative \nstructure viewers lack the ability to fit the major issues into an interpretive framework \nto help them understand what is occurring in the conflict. When for instance during \nthe Wye Accords a BBC journalist stated that 'they haven't even started to tackle the \nmost serious issues yet those include the future of Jewish settlements like this one, the \nfuture of Jerusalem, of Palestinian refugees and the shape of Israel's final borders', \nmost viewers would not understand such a statement because they lack the historical \nknowledge to appreciate the salience of each issue in the overall context of the \nconflict. Philo and Berry (2004) found the absence of historical background left many \nviewers bewildered by the conflict and how it might be resolved. The lack of \nhistorical context also had another important and deleterious effect in that it led \npeople to avoid news bulletins dealing with the conflict. Ironically broadcasters' \ndesire to maximise audiences by prioritising dramatic scenes of violence and conflict \nover analysis, actually had the opposite effect in that it led many viewers to turn away \n203 \nfrom what was perceived as an endless and incomprehensible procession of death and \nsuffering. \nThere were also other areas where audience understandings closely mirrored \nthe presence or absence of issues within news coverage. For instance, during coverage \nof the Wye Accords journalists did not explain the nature of the military occupation \nthat the Israelis were imposing on the Palestinians or its consequencesuch as \nrestrictions on movement and lack of access to clean water. There was also no \nmention of human rights abuses such as torture and extra-judicial killings that have \nbeen committed by the Israelis or the large number of United Nations resolutions \ncondemning these and the illegality of the occupation. Since so many viewers rely on \ntelevision news as their main source of information on the conflict it is perhaps \nunsurprising that so few were aware of such issues: \nGiven that so many did not know there was a military occupation, it is not \nsurprising that the consequences of it for Palestinians were little understood. \nEven in groups that were comparatively well informed, such as middle class \nmales in Glasgow, there was little knowledge of economic consequences such \nas those caused by the Israeli control of water. In the focus groups as a whole \nonly 9 per cent were aware of this issue. There was little understanding of \nareas such as human rights - only two people in all the focus groups raised \nthese as an issue. Even in groups that tended to be sympathetic to the \nPalestinians (such as low income males in London) there was some surprise \nwhen they heard that there were pass laws and identity cards which restricted \nmovement. There was also no knowledge of the large number of UN \nresolutions, which have been passed, either those relating to the legality of the \noccupation or to human rights abuses in the territories (Philo & Berry, 2004: \n218) \nStrong parallels could also be drawn between media coverage and audience \nunderstanding of issues such as Israeli settlements and American mediation. Philo and \nBerry (2004) report that there was a strong tendency for viewers to see Israeli \nsettlements in the manner in which they were presented in news bulletins, as small \nembattled communities subject to attack from Palestinians for no clearly identifiable \nreason. Few viewers interviewed in the focus groups saw the settlements as serving a \n204 \ncritical strategic role as part of the military occupation or were aware that they are \nwidely seen as illegal under international law. Similarly only a minority of viewers \nwere aware that the United States supplies Israel with economic and military support. \nWhilst many saw the United States as fulfilling a peace-brokering role, far fewer \nunderstood why Palestinians might distrust this mediation. \nOverall audience research tends to suggest that many gaps in audience \nunderstandings are related to specific absences in television news coverage. The \nconsequence of this appears to be that most viewers are badly informed, lack a basic \nunderstanding of the Palestinian perspective and are confused about the ways in \nwhich the conflict might be resolved. \nMedia, Power and Ideological Closure \nIn chapter one I outlined a number of factors which affected the production of \nnews. These included commercial imperatives, sourcing, public relations, intimidation \nby government or private bodies, cultural assumptions and j ournalism training. A \nnumber of theorists have formulated models which incorporate some of these factors \nin order to address the question of the relationship between journalism and \neconomic/political power (Milliband, 1973; Althusser, 1971; Murdock and Golding, \n1979; Glasgow Media Group, 1975; Herman & Chomsky, 1988). In The State in \nCapitalist Society Ralph Milliband argues that the mass media play an instrumental \nrole in providing the ideological justification for a particular pattern of class \ndomination. He identifies three key factors that produce this outcome: the ownership \nand control of media, the economic and cultural effects of the mass media's reliance \non advertising and pressure from Government and other parts of the state. Milliband \nargues from a strong structuralist position, rooted in political economy, which leaves \nlittle space for journalists to challenge (even if they had the inclination, which he \nsuggest they mostly do not) the assumptions of the status quo: \nGiven the political and economic contexts in which they function [the mass \nmedia cannot fail to be, predominately, agencies for the dissemination of ideas \nand values which affirm rather than challenge existing structures of power and \nprivilege \n.... \nThe notion that they can, for the most part, be anything else is \neither a delusion or a mystification (1973: 211) \n205 \nHerman and Chomsky's propaganda model takes the three factors in Milliband's \nmodel and adds an organizational dimension by pointing to way in which \nrelationships between institutional sources and j ournalists tend to filter out \noppositional voices. Like Milliband, Herman and Chomsky see the media as Primarily \nfulfilling the role of reflecting and legitimizing the present social order and the \nactivities of the state. Also like Milliband, Herman and Chomsky see this outcome not \nas the result of deliberate intent or a conspiracy but rather as a consequence of the \ninterplay of various structural factors, primarily rooted in political economy. \nA rather different model of media filters was suggested by Richard Hoggart in \nthe foreword to Bad News. Hoggart's model is more concerned with the constraints of \nthe medium and the practices of journalism than with political economy. It is a \nformulation which is far less overtly ideological and functional than those offered by \nMilliband or Herman and Chomsky. Hoggart suggests that the 'news selects itself by \nfour main filtering processes' (Glasgow Media Group, 1976: x). These are time and \nresource constraints inherent to the medium, 'news values', 'television values' and \nwhat Hoggart describes as the 'cultural air we breathe, the whole ideological \natmosphere of our society, which tells us that some things can be said and that others \nhad best not be said' (Glasgow Media Group, 1976: x). Hoggart was also critical of \nwhat he describes as 'high conspiracy theories' of the mass media which he suggests \nassume too great a degree of ideological closure: \nBut the basic inadequacy, even of the most subtle forms of 'high conspiracy \ntheory ' is that, useful and revealing though they can be, they miss the \ncomplexity of the matter if you hang onto them for too long. For in \ncommercial democracies such as Britain the agenda is not wholly structured \nand the deviant items are not simply 'permitted variations', the repressive \ntolerances of an authority which is wholly in control in the background. \nSomething sometimes escapes, precisely because the controls, explicit or \nimplicit, are not complete, because the claims for ob ectivity and neutrality by \nthe broadcasters- though often made too smugly and blandly- do also have \nbehind them, in some people, a belief that the effort at objectivity and \nneutrality is important beyond all outside pressure (Glasgow Media Group, \n1976: xii) \n206 \nHoggart here is alerting the reader to the potential slippage between how the powerful \nwould wish to see issues reported and how they are actually reported in practice. We \nare, he suggests, not dealing with a completely rigid and closed ideological system, \nbut a more complicated situation in which political and economic power confers \nsignificant advantages in ideological struggles but does completely determine them. \nCommercial imperatives, organizational priorities and the journalistic ethos of \n'impartiality' can all mediate this relationship and we should be aware of the potential \ncomplexities that are involved. In many ways Hoggart's criticisms of 'high conspiracy \ntheories' are analogous to Schlesinger's (1990) criticisms of Stuart Hall's concept of \n6primary definers'. In Policing the Crisis Hall et. al. (1978) had argued that powerful \ninstitutional sources are consigned the role of 'primary definers' who because of their \nprivileged access to the media are able to set the terms of debate for issues. Those \nwho then engage in the media debate must work within the framework that has been \nset down by the primary definers. Hall illustrated this by pointing to a debate about \nsocial disorder and immigration where he suggested the primary definition was that it \nwas a 'problem of numbers'. He then showed how the debates around immigration \nwere structured around the issue of numbers rather than drawing in alternative \nexplanations such as white, working class racism. However as Schlesinger (1990) has \nargued this leaves open the question of how and why the framework of debate \nestablished by the primary definers might break down. Again we are back to the \nargument that media are not a completely closed ideological system where the views \nof the powerful are handed down like tablets from Mount Sinai. Hall's model can also \noverstate the degree of ideological conformity amongst institutional sources, and \nunderestimate the potential for non-institutional sources such as pressure groups to \nalter the terms of the debate. We can see this very clearly if we look at two others \nstudies. In their research on the struggle over the definition of the AIDS crisis Miller \net. al., suggest that although the institutions of the state were able to access \npromotional resources and influence media agendas, they did not completely control \nthe debate: \nDefinitions of social issues do not simply emerge from the centres of political \npower. Campaigners did manage to influence the production and circulation of \ndefinitions around AIDS. In addition, the media can themselves contribute to \n207 \nmodifying the definitions of the powerful. Most importantly, we have \nsuggested that the construction of 'primary' definitions in the media may not \nnecessarily set the terms for policy decisions. As we saw in the discussion of \nthe health education campaign, the ability of ministers or others to intervene in \nthe production process was sometimes quite independent of the dominant \ndefinitions carried in the media (Kitzinger & Miller, 1998: 223-224) \nSimilarly in their study of how the Toronto media interacted with the state's \nlaw enforcement agencies, Ericson, Baranek and Chen (1989) point to a complex \nseries of negotiations between j ournalists and source bureaucracies over how issues \nwere to be framed in news reports. The public relations staff employed by the state's \ncriminal justice certainly worked hard to try and get their perspective across but were \nnot always successful, and their efforts were mediated by the commercial and \norganizational priorities of the media organizations they interacted with. \nThere is however one way in which at least a partial rapprochement can be \nachieved between the stronger structuralist theories such as the Herman and Chomsky \npropaganda model and those who advocate the existence of a more fluid, contested \nspace. This requires an acceptance that the space for ideological openness and closure \non issues is related to both the nature of the issue and the particular moment at which \nthe issue is debated. Certain issues will have more latitude for contestation because \ntheir definition is not considered important or 'sensitive' by governments. The issue \nof AIDS information strategies discussed by Miller et. al. above, would appear to fall \ninto this category. How the issue was defined and debated was not likely to \nsignificantly affect the fortunes of the Conservative party. Conversely on issues such \nas the reporting of unemployment or the Northern Ireland conflict, both subjects \nwhich were important for the image of the Tories in the 1980s, it was clear that \nsignificant pressure was brought to bear on broadcasters to limit dissent, though this \nwas not always successful (see chapter one). The contours of openness and closure on \ncontroversial issues is also strongly determined by political and economic \ncircumstances. At certain moments governments may face a potential crisis of \nlegitimacy and the space for dissent may become constrained. This of course is \nparticularly noticeable during wartime when the need to win public consent is \nprobably at its peak. Those who express alternative opinions at such moments may be \n208 \nparticularly vulnerable to orchestrated attacks from politicians. The fate of the former \nBBC journalist Andrew Gilligan is perhaps the most obvious recent example. \nSo how does the research in this thesis relate to these arguments about \npolitical/economic power and ideological openness and closure? In many ways the \nresearch provides evidence that many of the factors identified by theorists have a \ncrucial impact on reporting on the Israel-Palestine conflict, but it also suggests that \ncoverage is not completely monolithic or rigid. Of particular importance appears to be \nthree of the factors identified in Herman and Chomsky's propaganda model: 'flak', \nsourcing and the need to maximize profits (or audiences). The pro-Israel lobby \nappears able to intimidate both news organisations and journalists. The application of \npressure through organised campaigns of letter and email writing, as well as \ncomplaints from Israeli officials and embassies, together with interventions from well \nconnected Israel supporters in the media and political life appears to have created a \nclimate where journalists and editors are sometimes reluctant to air the Palestinian \nperspective. There is also the charge of anti-Semitism which is sometimes levelled \nagainst j ournalists and broadcasters, which it has been suggested has a particularly \nchilling impact on dissent, especially at the BBC. According to Mayhew and Adams \n(1975) this is not new. Nearly thirty years ago they alleged that attempts were made to \nsilence and discredit those who criticised Israeli behaviour. This they alleged was \ncarried out using the same techniques, organised campaigns of letter writing and \ntelephone complaints directed at media outlets and the interventions of influential \nIsrael supporters in the media and political spheres. This points to the enduring impact \nof networks of power and influence, able over decades to fundamentally influence the \nclimate in which j ournalists operate. \nThe obverse of 'flak', public relations, also seems to be of crucial importance. \nWhilst the Israelis run a slick and highly professional operation, the Palestinian effort \nhas been rather amateurish in comparison. The proactive approach employed by \nIsraeli PR professionals involving 'schmoozing'journalists and flooding them with \nthe official Israeli perspective appeared effective in setting the media agenda during \nthe Wye negotiations, as evidenced by the prominence given to the Israeli perspective \non security at the expense of reporting what was of concern to Palestinians. Israeli \nsources with their good English, excellent presentational skills and use of soundbites \nare likely to come across as more credible to viewers than Palestinians representatives \n209 \nmany of whom are poor English speakers. It has been suggested that this is in part a \nconsequence of the cronyism of Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority where the \nresponsibilities for putting the Palestinian perspective has been delegated to Arafat \nsupporters many of whom lack the necessary public relations skills. \nThe issue of sourcing also appears highly significant. Israeli sources were featured \nmore often than Palestinian sources but neither were as accessed as much as \nAmerican sources. Since American sources tended to support Israeli positions this \nmagnified the imbalance. Taken together Israeli and American sources were given \nmore than three times as much space as Palestinian sources. A similar pattern was \nalso found in relation to the amount of space given to reported statements, where \nthose from Israelis outnumbered those from Palestinians by a factor of nearly two to \none. As previously noted there was also a pronounced emphasis on official sources. \nThis meant that the wide variety of debate about the conflict within the Israeli and \nPalestinian publics was largely absent. This was particularly significant in regard to \nPalestinian public opinion because it meant that the highly ambivalent relationship \nbetween Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian population was \nmissing from news reports. The theory that the media tends to 'over-access' the views \nof officials and other powerful institutional sources was supported in this research. \nThe arguments rooted in political economy, the need for media organizations to profit \nand hence audience maximise, also appear to have had an important effect on \ncoverage. The need to grab audiences by injecting drama partly explain the absence of \nhistorical background and the pronounced emphasis in coverage of the latest \ndevelopments of a peace process 'in crisis'. Whilst it might be assumed that the BBC \nas a public corporation, not dependent on advertising, would be insulated from the \nneed to audience maximize, in reality it is obliged to seek high rating in order to \njustify the license fee. It could of course be argued that Hoggart's stress on the \nimportance on 'news' and 'television' values is itself aj ournalistic justification for \nwhat are in effect choices structured by the need to maximize audiences and profits. \nIn this sense two of his filters are perhaps closer to the political economy perspective \nthan he overtly concedes. \nFinally the research in this thesis points to the importance of Britain's foreign policy \norientation in setting the tone for how journalists' report on the conflict. How this is \n210 \nactually achieved in practice is relatively under-theorised in journalism studies. \nOutright censorship by government is relatively uncommon and attempts by \ngovernment to gag and intimidate the media are a sign that more informal controls \nhave broken down. But how do these informal controls operate in practice? The \nformer BBC journalist Tim Llewelyn expressed to me the view that the BBC in effect \n4 sniffed the wind' to gauge what the British government's position on the conflict was \nand then adjusted its coverage accordingly. As discussed in chapter four, \nSchlesinger's ethnography of a BBC newsroom in the 1970s provided evidence that \njournalists whose perspectives differed widely from those of the governments on \nsensitive foreign policy issues such as the Vietnam War or the conflict in Northern \nIreland were subject to a range of official and unofficial sanctions. In this way editors \nwho were trusted as a 'safe pair of hands' could be relied upon to limit dissent on \ncertain issues. Conversely the activities of senior members of the Government can \n(sometimes unintentionally) open up opportunities for discussion of perspectives that \nwouldn't generally be aired. For instance at the end of October 2001 Tony Blair \nvisited Syria and met with President Assad before continuing on to Israel. A BBC \njournalist reported that: \nTomorrow's hosts are the very same people that today's hosts regard as bloody \nstate terrorists, and of course the Israelis think much the same thing of the \nSyrians, the Palestinians and others. \nThe j ourrialist also remarked that: \nSyria's President Assad \n... \nregards Palestinian suicide bombers and assassins as \nfteedom fighters. (BBCl late news, 30 October 2001, cited in Philo & Berry, \n2004: 172-3) \nPhilo and Berry (2004) note that this was the only time that the Palestinian \nperspective that they were victims of Israeli 'state terrorism', and were themselves \n'freedom fighters' was reported on by j oumalists. This suggests that Blair's visit to \nSyria in effect served to temporarily legitimize the reporting of the Palestinian/Arab \nview of the conflict 47 \n. \nIn this way, the activities and orientations of major political \nfigures are picked up on by j oumalists and can affect the range of debate on issues. \nThis is similar to the theory of primary definition, though it lacks the rigidity inherent \n211 \nin Hall's model. Politicians can set agendas and legitimate and de-legitimate \nviewpoints, but it does not necessarily follow on that all those who later engage in the \ndebate must work within those parameters. Furthermore the viewpoint of the primary \ndefiners may be challenged and sometimes de-legitimised especially if the arguments \nare contested by other high ranking politicians. \nThe research reported in this thesis indicated that during the Oslo peace process \njournalists found it much easier to present the official Israeli perspective than the \nviews of Palestinians and the wider international community. This was the result of a \nhost of factors creating constraints on how journalists could report on the conflict. \nHowever the research did not support the stronger structuralist models such as Hall's \ntheory of primary definition. Some aspects of the official Israeli perspective on the \nconflict were challenged by Palestinian spokespersons, though these perspectives \nwere much less likely to be highlighted and elaborated on by j oumalists. Furthermore \nthe relative prominence of Israeli perspectives cannot simply be taken for granted on \nthe basis of structural factors. The comments of Nachman Shai, which opened this \nchapter illustrated that winning public acceptance for the Israeli government's \nperspective is a constant and continuous process that requires a great deal of work. It \nis not as automatic and pre-ordained as some of the structuralist theories imply and it \ncan break down. Whilst the Israelis have been much more successful than the \nPalestinians in getting their point of view across to viewers, this may not always be \nthe case. For instance the death of Yasser Arafat may allow for the emergence of a \nnew generation of Palestinian spokespersons, better equipped to contest the public \nrelations struggle. The election of American administration inclined to adopt a more \neven-handed attitude to the conflict will also likely affect reporting. All of these \nfactors should alert researchers to the contingencies and complexities inherent in the \nproduction of news. \n212 \nEndnotes \n' Chomsky maintains that it 'has been virtually an axiom of US foreign policy that these \nenergy reserves should remain under US control; ' and that 'the flow of petrodollars should be \nlargely funnelled to the US through military purchases, construction projects, bank deposits, \ninvestments in treasury deposits, etc. ' ( 1999: 17). He argues that to protect against the threat \nthat indigenous nationalist movements might want to gain control of their own resources, the \nUnited States supports Israel and the region's Arab monarchies who are encouraged to act as \ncregional gendarmes' in support of American interests \n2 These have included Idi Amin in Uganda, Mobutu in Zaire, the Contras in Nicaragua, \nRhodesia, South Africa, Honduras, El Salvador and Turkey. \n3 In a letter dated 24 October 1915 McMahon laid out the areas that Britain planned to grant \nindependence: 'The two districts of Mersina and Alexandretta and portions of Syria lying \nwest of the districts of Damascus, Homs, Hama and Aleppo cannot be said to be purely Arab, \nand should be excluded from the limits demanded. With the above modification, and without \nprejudice to our existing treaties with Arab chiefs we accept those limits. As for the regions \nlying within those frontiers wherein Britain is free to act without detriment to the interests of \nher ally, France, I am empowered in the name of the Government of Great Britain to give the \nfollowing assurances and make the following reply to your letter: (1) Subject to the above \nmodifications, Great Britain is prepared to recognize and support the independence of the \nArabs in all the regions within the limits demanded by the Sharif of Mecca' (letter cited in \nIngrams, 1972: 2) \n4 According to the British census of 1922 the total population of Palestine was 752,048, \ncomprised of 83,790 Jews, 589,177 Muslims and 71,464 Christians (United Nations, 1945). \n5 In a memorandum to Lord Curzon on II August 1919, Balfour wrote: 'the contradiction \nbetween the letters of the Covenant and the policy of the Allies is even more flagrant in the \ncase of the 'independent nation' of Palestine than in that of the 'independent nation' of Syria. \nFor in Palestine we do not propose even to go through the form of consulting the wishes of \nthe present inhabitants of the country, though the American [King Crane] Commission has \nbeen going through the form of asking what they are' (British Government, Foreign Office, \n1919b, cited in Ingrams, 1972: 73) \n6 The Revisionist Movement were a political rival of Ben-Gurion's Labor movement. They \nespoused a more militant attitude towards the Arabs and a more liberal economic policy. \nMuch of their support came from Polish immigrants in the 1920s and 1930s. The Revisionists \nlaid claim to all of Palestine and Transjordan and argued that conflict with the Arabs was \ninevitable. Their military wing Betar was formed in the 1920s. Some Betar members split \n213 \naway in the 1930s to form the Irgun paramilitary group who fought the British mandatory \nauthorities in the 1940s. The Revisionist movement later provided much of the constituency \nfor the Herut and Likud parties. \n' The Oxford historian Albert Hourani described the Joan Peter's book as 'ludicrous and \nworthless' in The Observer. Ian and David Gilmour described it as 'preposterous' in the \nLondon Review ofBooks. Time Out described it as a 'piece of disinformation roughly the size \nand weight of a dried cowpat', whilst the chair of the Philosophy department at the Hebrew \nUniversity, Avishai Margalit condemned Peter's 'web of deceit'. (reviews cited in \nFinkelstein, 2001: 45-6). McCarthy argues that unrecorded Arab immigration into Palestine \nduring the Mandate period was 'small' and that for it to 'have had a significant effect on the \nethnic composition of Palestine it would have had to have been immense'. He concludes that \nthe 'argument that Arab immigration somehow made up a large part of the Palestinian Arab \npopulation is thus statistically untenable' (1990: 34). For a discussion of the effects of \nimprovements in sanitation and hygiene on population increase in Palestine see Friedlander & \nGoldscheider (1979). \n8 The U. S. Secretary of State, James Byrnes, wrote to the British Foreign Secretary, Lord \nHalifax, arguing that American Jewry was not interested in the plight of the refugees in \nEurope, their main concern was that Jews 'ought to have a country to call their own'. Harold \nBeeley in the British Foreign Office complained that 'the Zionists have been deplorably \nsuccessful in selling the idea that even after the Allied victory immigration to Palestine \nrepresented for many Jews 'their only hope of survival\" (both cited in Ovendale, 1999: 94). \n9 The pressure to open up Palestine to the Jewish refugees worried the British who feared the \nimpact on public order. Ovendale (1999) claims that the U. S. War department had estimated \nthat it would have to send 300,000 troops to Palestine to keep the peace if the area was \nopened to Jewish immigration. He also suggests that the U. S. State Department was also \nconcerned that an Arab backlash would strengthen Russian influence in a vital geo-strategic \narea and recommended that the British colonial Empire be maintained intact. \n10 For a comprehensive overview of the case put forward by the Arab delegates see the \nOfficial Records of the General Assembly, Second Session, Ad Hoc Committee on the \nPalestine Question, pp. 276-279, cited in UN, 1990). \nA number of delegates including Lebanese representatives claimed during debates at the \nUN, that representatives from the US and USSR had used bribes and threats of economic \nsanctions in order to coerce smaller States to vote for the Partition of Palestine (Official \nRecords of the General Assembly, Second Session, Plenary Meetings, vol. 11,124th meeting: \n1310) \n214 \n12 For an overview of the concept of transfer in Zionist thinking see Masalha (1992). This \nperspective is challenged by Karsh (2000). \n\" In 1959 the Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi went through the official records of Arab \ngovernments as well as Arab newspapers and the radio monitoring reports of the BBC and \nCIA and could find no evidence of broadcasts urging Palestinians to nee. This research was \nalso independently corroborated by the Irish scholar Erskine Childers in 196 1. For an \noverview and discussion of the controversy see Hitchens & Said (1988). Some historians such \nas Gilbert (1999) argue that many Arabs left voluntarily prior to the arrival of the Arab armies \nin May 1948 without mentioning the impact of the alleged broadcasts. \n14 This controversial incident has been the subject of much debate. The Israeli authorities have \nalways maintained that it was a 'tragic case of misidentification'. Bregman (2003: 120-122) \nnotes that others have suggested that it was deliberately undertaken to prevent the Liberty \nfrom detecting Israeli troop concentrations massing in Galilee as part of the next days attack \non the Golan Heights. He argues that recently declassified tapes of conversations between \nairforce personnel support the conclusion that the attack on the American ship was deliberate. \n15 Yitzak Rabin remarked after Israel's victory that 'I do not believe that Nasser wanted war. \nThe two divisions that he sent into Sinai on May 14 would not have been enough to unleash \nan offensive against Israel. He knew it and we knew it. ' (Le Monde, 29 February 1968 cited in \nHirst 1977: 211). In a 1982 speech at the National Defense College Menachem Begin stated \nthat 'The Egyptian Army concentrations in the Sinai do not prove that Nasser was not really \nabout to attack us. We must be honest with ourselves. We decided to attack him. ' (New York \nTimes, 21 August 1982). \n16 Menachem Begin claimed that in the penultimate Ministerial Committee on Defense prior to \nthe War military leaders 'had no doubt of victory' and 'expressed their belief not only in the \nstrength of the anny but also in its ability to rout the enemy' (Begin cited in Finkelstein, \n1999: 135) The former Commander of the Israeli Air Force Ezer Weizmann has claimed in \nrelation to the 1967 War that 'there was no threat of destruction to the State of Israel but that \nthe war was justified so that Israel could 'exist according to the scale, spirit and quality she \nnow embodies' (Haaretz, 29 March 1972, cited in Chomsky, 1999: 100). \n17 Norman Finkelstein (1999) alleges that Marshall Tito of Yugoslavia put forward a peace \nplan involving a full Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories in exchange for 'full \ndemilitarization and other security guarantees in the evacuated territories, as well as an 'end \nto the call for an Arab state of Palestine'. He alleges that this proposal was accepted by both \nEgypt and Jordan but rejected by Israel as 'one-sided'. \n18 The British representative Lord Carodon denied any ambiguity in the interpretation 242 \nclaiming that 'in our resolution we stated the principle of the 'withdrawal of Israeli armed \n215 \nforces from territories occupied in the recent conflict' and in the preamble emphasized the \n'the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war'. In our view the wording of the \nprovisions is clear. '. The French delegate emphasised that 'on the point which the French \ndelegation has always stressed as being essential - \nthe question of the withdrawal of the \noccupation forces- the resolution which has been adopted, if we refer to the French text which \nis equally authentic with the English, leaves no room for any ambiguity, since it speaks of \nwithdrawal 'des territoires occupes', which indisputably corresponds to the expression \n4occupied territories'. The Indian representative asserted that 'the principle of the \ninadmissibility of territorial acquisition by force is absolutely fundamental to our approach' \nand 'it is our understanding that the draft resolution, if approved by the Council, will commit \nit to the application of the principle of total withdrawal of Israeli forces ftom all of the \nterritories- I repeat, all the territories \n- occupied by Israel as a result of the conflict which \nbegan on 5 June 1967. ' (all cited in Finkelstein 2001: 146) \n19Finkelstein points to the memoirs of the American diplomat Dean Rusk who claimed that \nthe United States favoured omitting the definite article in the withdrawal clause because 'we \nthough the Israeli border along the West Bank could be 'rationalised' certain anomalies could \neasily be straightened out with some exchanges of territory, making a more sensible border \nfor all parties'. (Rusk, 1992: 388-9, cited in Finkelstein, 2001: 148). However he stressed 'we \nnever contemplated any significant grant of territory to Israel as a result of the June 1967 war. \nOn that point we and the Israelis to this day remain sharply divided'. (Rusk, 1992: 388-9, \ncited in Finkelstein, 2001: 148) \n20 See for instance Efrain Karsh, What Occupation, Commentary, July 2002 or Max Singer, \nRight is Might, Jerusalem Post, 29 June 1997. \n21 Chomsky points to an article by Yedidia Segal in the 3 September 1982 issue of Nekudah, \nthejournal of the religious West Bank settlers, which stated that 'those among us who call for \na humanistic attitude towards our [Arab] neighbours are reading the Halacha [religious law] \nselectively and are avoiding specific commandments'. Segal argues that the Gentiles are 'a \npeople like a donkey' and that the scriptures insist that 'conquered' peoples must 'serve' their \nJewish masters and must be kept 'degraded and low' and 'must not raise their heads in Israel \nbut must be conquered beneath their hand \n... \nwith complete submission'. 'There is no relation' \nSegal insists 'between the law of Israel and the and the atheistic modem humanism' citing \nMaimonides that 'in a divinely-commanded war [such as the 1982 Lebanon invasion] one \nmust destroy kill and eliminate men, women and children' there being 'no place for any \nhumanistic considerations' (cited in Chomsky, 1999: 123-4) \n22 United Nations General Assembly resolution 54/37 adopted I December 1999 \n216 \n23 Hirst claims that 'In Israel's Arab schools children have always had to see their own Arab \nculture, history and religion through Israeli eyes: they saw it deliberately mocked and \nfalsified. Arab history became little more than a series of revolutions, murders feuds and \nplunderings, whilst everything in the Jewish past was ennobled and glorified. It was always \nthe Arabs in decline they learned about, never in their greatness; the heroes of the past, the \nProphet, the Caliph Harun al-Rashid and Saladin, got perfunctory mention. In four years of \nsecondary education Arab children had 384 periods of Jewish history as against only 32 of \ntheir own. The study of Old Testament was compulsory, while the Muslim and Christian \nreligions were not taught at all. (1977: 23 8) \n24 For instance General Assembly Resolution 53/56 passed 3 December 1998 by 151 votes to \n2, Resolution 52/67 passed 10 December 1997 by 151 to 2, Resolution 51/134 passed 13 \nDecember 1996 by 149 votes to 2, Resolution 49/36C passed 9 December 1994 by 145 votes \nto 2, Resolution 47/70D passed 14 December 1992 by 142 votes to 2. \n25 In the late 1970s a Sunday Times report (19 June 1977) found that torture was so \nwidespread and systematic that 'it appears to be sanctioned at some level as deliberate policy\" \nperhaps 'to persuade Arabs in the occupied territories that it is least painful to behave \npassively'. More recently Amnesty International has issued annual reports cataloguing the use \nof torture by the Israeli authorities (e. g. Amnesty International: 2001 a, 2000,1999b, 1998, \n1997) A report (Amnesty International, 1999a) entitled Flouting UN Obligations in the Name \nofSecurity concluded that Israeli 'interrogation methods, such as violent shaking, or hooding \nand shackling detainees to low chairs with loud music playing, constituted torture or cruel, \ninhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and thus contravened Article I of the \nConvention against Torture' and that torture is 'officially authorized at the highest level and \nindeed effectively legalized. 'In the same report it was noted that the 1600 Palestinians \ndetained by Israeli security forces in 1998 were 'routinely tortured or ill-treated during \ninterrogation' The Independent journal ist Robert Fisk has produced a number of reports from \nthe Israeli controlled Khiam detention centre in Southern Lebanon detailing the use of electric \nshock torture applied to the genitals. (Independent, 20 May 2000). A BBC Correspondent \ndocumentary (4 November 2000) also reported from Khiam, claiming that torture had also \nbeen used against children and pregnant women, and that prisoners had been tortured to \ndeath, in what Amnesty International described as 'war crimes' \n26 The use of 'administrative detention' involved detaining Palestinians for long periods \nwithout trial or legal recourse. In the 1970s Hirst alleges that many Palestinians suspected of \ninvolvement with opposition movements were interned in camps in the desert: 'At its worst it \nmeant the establishment of veritable concentration camps buried in remote comers of the \nSinai desert. Nakhl, Abu Zu'aiman, Kusseimah were the names of places where whole \n217 \nfamilies were kept in isolation from the outside world. They were there because relatives of \ntheirs were suspected, no more, of working for the resistance. Crowded into tents surrounded \nby barbed wire, they were denied radios, newspapers or the most basic amenities from their \nhomes, which were frequently destroyed during their captivity. Women and children would \nbe put in one camp, male relatives of 'wanted persons' brother, nephews, cousins- in another' \n(1977: 248). By 1980 the Israeli daily Haaretz estimated the number of security prisoners or \ndetainees passing through Israeli jails since 1967 at close to 200,000 people or 20% of the \npopulation leading to a situation of 'horrendous overcrowding' and 'appalling human \nsuffering and corruption' \n(8 August 1980, cited in Chomsky, 1999: 128). For more recent reports on detention without \ntrial see Amnesty International (1999a). \n27 Collective punishment could involve curfews where the local population is not allowed out \nfor more than a hour or two a day for weeks or months at a time, schools are closed and there \nis no employment. Israel has justified the use of curfews on the basis that confining the \nPalestinian population to their homes for long periods prevents militants from attacking Jews. \nThe use of collective punishment is illegal under international law and Israel has drawn \nrepeated censure from the United Nations: 'The United Nations Commission on Human \nRights calls upon Israel to cease immediately its policy of enforcing collective punishments, \nsuch as demolition of houses and closure of the Palestinian territory, measures which \nconstitute flagrant violations of international law and international humanitarian law, \nendanger the lives of Palestinians and also constitute a major obstacle in the way of peace' \n(United Nations, 1999). A report by the Israeli journalist Aharon Bachar in the Israeli daily \nYediot Ahornot described a meeting where Labour Alignment leaders presented Menachem \nBegin with 'detailed accounts of terrorist acts [against Arabs] in the conquered territories' \nThey described the collective punishment in the town of Halhul where: 'The men were taken \nfrom their houses beginning at midnight, in pyjamas, in the cold. The notables and other men \nwere concentrated in the square of the mosque and held there until morning. Meanwhile men \nof the border guards broke into house beating people with shouts and curses. During the many \nhours that hundreds of people were kept in the mosque square, they were ordered to urinate \nand excrete on one another and also to sing Hatikva [Jewish National Anthem] and to call out \n'Long Live the State of Israel' Several times people were beaten and ordered to crawl on the \nground. Some were even ordered to lick the earth. At the same time four trucks were \ncommandeered and at daybreak, the inhabitants were loaded onto the trucks, about 100 in \neach truck, and taken like sheep to the Administration headquarters in Hebron. '(3 December \n1982, cited in Chomsky, 1999: 13 1) The report further alleged that prisoners were beaten, \ntortured and humiliated and that settlers were permitted into prisons to take part in the \n218 \nbeatings. For more recent reports on collective punishments see Amnesty International report \n(200 1 b; 2001 c) or Human Rights Watch (1996). \n28 Hirst cites evidence from the Israeli League for Civil and Human Rights, that searches \n4were often carried with great brutality and violence'. During night time raids, Hirst claims \nthat it was a 4regular practice to \n... \ncarry men off to prison without any good reason, beat them \nup and torture them' (1977: 249) \n29 After 1967 there were numerous diplomatic efforts to break the deadlock, all of which were \nfruitless. King Hussein's issued a six point peace plan in early 1969 at the National press \nclub in Washington. Speaking officially in conjunction with Egypt's Nasser, Hussein offered \na comprehensive peace treaty and recognition of Israel in exchange for 'the withdrawal of its \narmed forces from all territories occupied in the June 1967 war, and the implementation of all \nthe other provisions of the Security Council Resolution (242)', adding that Israel may have \neither peace or territory-but she can never have both' (Washington Report on Middle East \nAffairs, 2 April 1984) This proposal was rejected by Israel. In December 1969 the American \nSecretary of State William Rogers put forward another peace agreement based on UN \nResolution 242, specifying that Israel would return to the pre- 1967 borders (with minor \nborder modifications) and a solution to the Palestinian refugee problem would have to be \nfound, in exchange for a comprehensive peace treaty. The proposals were rejected by the \nIsraeli cabinet who declared that 'if these proposals were carried out, Israel's security and \npeace would be in grave danger. Israel will not be sacrificed to by any power policy, and will \nreject any attempt to impose a forced solution upon it. ' (cited in Shlaim, 2000: 291). In 1971 \nthe Swedish diplomat Dr. Gunnar Jarring reported that Egypt had offered Israel a full peace \ntreaty based on resolution 242, with the stipulation that Israel also had to withdraw from the \nSinai and Gaza Strip, settle the refugee problem in line with UN resolutions, and establish a \nUN force to keep the peace. Israel's reply though positive insisted that 'Israel will not return \nto the pre-5 June 1967 lines' (Shlaim, 2000: 300). This, Shlaim (2000) suggests, doomed the \nJarring Initiative. It also drew repeated criticism from the United Nations. The Jarring \nInitiative was followed by attempts at achieving an interim solution which Shlaim suggests \nfloundered on Israel's refusal to accept a timetable for a permanent settlement, and its desire \nfor territorial revisionism. There followed in 1972 and 1973 a number of openly annexationist \npronouncements by Israeli leaders. Moeshe Dayan told Time magazine in July 1973 'there is \nno more Palestine. Finished' and in April 1973 interview he talked of 'a new state of Israel \nwith broad frontiers, strong and solid, with the authority of the Israeli government extending \nfrom the Jordan to the Suez Canal. ' (both cited in Shlaim, 2000: 316). Shlaim suggest that this \ntogether with the later publication of the Galilee document detailing a large expansion of \n219 \nsettlement building in the occupied territories, left Sadat little choice but to use force to try \nand regain the Sinai. \n30 Boyle (2002) argues that when the Israeli forces started advancing the Soviets had \nconsidered inserting their own force into the conflict leading the Americans to raise their \nnuclear alert to Def Con Three, the highest state of preparedness. He claims that in the face of \nthis the Soviets backed down but that the World had come perilously close to a nuclear \nconfrontation between the superpowers. Three Israeli and American analysts have also \nclamed that Israel threatened to use nuclear weapons against Egypt and in fact prepared to do \nso at the beginning of the 1973 war in order to force America to provide a massive \nconsignment of conventional weapons, which was forthcoming (Perlmutter, Handel & Bar\u0002Joseph, 1982). \n31 In March 1977 the Palestinian National Council called for an 'independent national state' in \nPalestine and an Arab-Israeli peace conference. Prime minister Rabin's reply was that 'the \nonly place the Israelis could meet the Palestinian guerillas was on the field on battle' (New \nYork Times, 21 March 1977) In 1977 the PLO leaked a 'peace plan' in Beirut that stated that \nthe (explicitly rejectionist) Palestinian National Covenant would not serve as the basis for a \ninterstate relations and that any progression beyond a two state solution 'would be achieved \nby peaceful means' (Manchester Guardian Weekly, 7 August 1977). In November 1978 \nTillman claims that Yasser Arafat in requesting a dialogue with American representatives \nissued the following statement: 'The PLO will accept an independent Palestinian state \nconsisting of the West Bank and Gaza, with connecting corridor, and in that circumstance will \nrenounce any and all violent means to enlarge the territory of the state. I would reserve the \nright, of course, to use non-violent means, that is to say diplomatic and democratic means, to \nbring about the eventual unification of all Palestine... we will give de facto recognition to the \nState of Israel' (Tillman, 1982: 215-8) In April 1981 after PLO acceptance of the Soviet \npeace plan, the PLO representative Issam Sartawi declared that 'from this it follows that the \nPLO has formally conceded to Israel, in the most unequivocal manner, the right to exist on a \nreciprocal basis'. A week later Sartawi issued ajoint statement with the former Israel general \nMattityahu Peled: 'the PLO has made its willingness to accept and recognize the state of \nIsrael on the basis of mutual recognition of each nation's legitimate right of self\u0002determination crystal clear in various resolutions since 1977' (all references cited in \nChomsky, 1999: 68-78) \n32 Testimony of Dr. Chris Giannou before the House Subcommittee on Europe and the Middle \nEast, 13/7/1982 (cited in Chomsky, 1999: 229) \n33 Fort other reports on ill treatment of detainees see Der Spiegel, 14 March 1983; Haolam \nHaze, 15 December 1982; or The Times, 18 March 1983 \n220 \n34 On the subject of Palestinian weaponry see Ze'ev Schiff, (Haaretz, 18 July 1982) or \nHirsh Goodman (Jerusalem Post, 9 July 1982) who suggested the Palestinian 'army' and \nweapons posed no significant threat to Israel and that many of the claims regarding the scale \nof weaponry were exaggerated. With regard to cease-fire violations the Christian Science \nMonitor (18 March 1982) reported that the PLO had observed the ceasefire despite many \nIsraeli provocations. The Abu Nidal group who attempted to assassinate the Israeli \nambassador were sworn enemies of the PLO leadership and had previously tried to \nassassinate Yasser Arafat.

' It found that violence directed against minors \nincluding 'slapping, punching, kicking, hair pulling, beatings with clubs or with iron rods, \npushing into walls and onto floors, ' was 'very common'. It also detailed more severe forms of \nill treatment: 'Beating the detainee as he is suspended in a closed sack covering the head and \ntied around the knees; tying the detainee in a twisted position to an outdoor pipe with hands \nbehind the back for hours and, sometimes, in the rain, at night, and during the hot daytime \nhours; confining the detainee, sometimes for a few days, in the 'lock-up' -a dark, smelly \nand suffocating cell one and a half by one and a half meters [five by five feet]; placing the \ndetainee, sometimes for many hours, in the 'closet' -a narrow cell the height of a person in \nwhich one can stand but not move; and depositing the tied-up detainee for many hours in the \nc grave' -a kind of box, closed by a door from the top, with only enough room to crouch and \nno toilet. ' The Israeli daily Hotam (I April 1988) reported the beating of a ten year old during \nan army interrogation who was left c looking like a steak', noting that soldiers 'weren't \nbothered' when they later found out that the boy was deaf mute and mentally retarded. \nReporting on the treatment of Palestinians as young as 14 arrested 'on suspicion of stone \nthrowing' the Israeli daily Hadashot (24 February 1992) cited the testimony of a insider at the \nHebron detention centre: 'What happened there \n... \nwas plain horror: they would break their \nclubs on the prisoners' bodies, hit them in the genitals, tie a prisoner up on the cold floor and \n221 \nplay soccer with him \n- literally kick and roll him around. Then they'd give him electric \nshocks, using the generator of a field telephone, and then push him out to stand for hours in \nthe cold and rain.... They would crush the prisoners, \n... \nturning them into lumps of meat' All \nabove reports cited in Finkelstein (1996: 47-9). \n3'For other references on Hezbollah's influence on Hamas see Haaretz (21 April 1994) or \nNida'al- Watan (15 November 1996) \n39Amongst others the poet Mahmoud Darwish, the PLO's Lebanon representative Shafiq al\u0002Hut (both of whom resigned from the PLO executive committee in protest), the leader of the \nPalestinian negotiating team and Gaza Red Crescent Society, Haidar Abd al-Shafi, the \nPalestinian negotiator as well as other prominent Fatah and PLO officials \n40 Hezbollah which also run a network of social services, claim they are trying to protect the \nlocal population, many of whom have been expelled from their home by Israel's proxy force \nthe South Lebanon. Human rights groups have condemned the expulsions as 'war crimes' and \ndemanded that they stop (Human Rights Watch, 1999). The organization has also condemned \nboth Israel and Hezbollah for targeting civilians. \n4' European Parliament 1997-8 Session. Extract of the Minutes of the meeting of 13'h March \n1997. Resolution on Israel's policy of new settlement and the peace process in the Middle \nEast, B4-0198,0219,0224,0233,0248 and 0264/97. \n42Amnesty notes that this has been achieved by restricting residency since 'the only \nPalestinians allowed to live in East Jerusalem are those holding blue identity cards - \ni. e. \npeople counted in the census following the 1967 occupation, and their descendants' This \npolicy has also served to curtail 'the normal migrational flows from rural areas'. Amnesty \nreports that although the blue cards are supposed to grant permanent residency status in East \nJerusalem 'in practice however at least 6,257 of these blue cards had been confiscated under \nvarious pretexts up to 1998, rendering the holders' continued presence in their native city \nillegal and aimed at expelling the holder and family from East Jerusalem'. Since 1996 \nPalestinians have also had to prove that their 'centre of life' is in Jerusalem using a variety of \nofficial documents. This had meant that the number of expulsions 'has increased to an \naverage of 700 a year' \n43 Israel has consistently argued that a large influx of returning Palestinian refugees would \npresent the state with serious security problems. The Israeli historian Benny Morris has \nargued that allowing the return of refugees to Israel would lead to the 'physical destruction' of \nthe state: \n'A country divided between Israelis on the one hand and on the other Palestinians \nwho had returned and were filled with anger not only at the way they had been treated \n222 \nin the past but also at not finding their villages or homes available-that country \nwould quickly become ungovernable. Each individual Jew living in the country \nwould be facing a real physical danger' (The Right of Return: An Interview with \nBenny Morris, Tikkun, March/April 2001) \nMorris also argues that the 'state envisioned by the founders of Zionism was a state composed \nof a large majority of Jews' and that 'if you were to allow a right of return for several million \nPalestinians (who have higher birthrates than Israeli Jews) you'd soon have an almost \nbalanced Arab/Jewish population-and that would soon mean that you'd no longer have a \nJewish state. ' Unlike Western democracies, which are considered legally as the state of their \ncitizens, Israel is defined as the 'state of the Jewish people'. Israel argues that granting a right \nof return to Palestinians would lead to a dilution in the scale of this Jewish majority and \ntherefore destroy the 'Jewish character' of the state. A few Israelis, such as Yehudith Harel, a \nmember of the Peace Now movement, however have argued that the positions taken by \nintellectuals such as Benny Morris and the mainstream peace camp are self-serving and \ninflexible: \nThe attitudes reflected in [Amos] Oz's (founder of the Peace Now movement) article, \neven more than the political positions expressed, are the epitome of the intellectual \ncorruption and the emotional handicap of the Israeli mainstream peace camp \nintelligentsia. This has generated within Israeli circles a deep-rooted patronising, self\u0002righteous discourse, a lack of empathy for other people's suffering, a lack of \nunderstanding of their perspective and needs and, above all, an almost chronic \nconviction that the 'other' has to act in the best of Israeli interests. '(Yehudith Harel, \nPeace Now and its 'Other'. Al-Ahram Weekly, January II- 17,200 1) \n44 Some elements of Palestinian opinion such as Al-Awda, the Palestinian Right to Return \nCoalition, made up of grassroots activists have declared in public statements that the right of \nreturn is inalienable and non-negotiable and cannot be bartered away by Yasser Arafat or any \nother Palestinian: 'We, the Palestinians undersigned below, at home and in exile, affirm once \nmore that the Right of Return is an Inalienable Right, has no statute of limitation and does not \npermit concessions or delegation by others. It is a basic Human Right as affirmed by the \nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, regional Conventions and UN resolutions especially \nthe oft-repeated UN resolution 194. It is also derived from the sanctity of private ownership \nwhich is not extinguished by occupation or sovereignty' (Al-Awda, Press Release, 9.2.2002). \nOthers have suggested mechanisms whereby the right could be accepted in principle, but \n223 \ncurtailed in practice, with significant numbers returning to a future Palestinian state, and a \nsmall number of symbolic refugees returning to Israel. For more information on these debates \nsee Shaml: The Palestinian Diaspora and Refugee Centre website. \nhttp: //www. shaml. org/groundNusseibeh/index. htm \n\" See for example the Letter dated 16 June 1980 from the Permanent Representative of Italy \nto the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General, UN Document A/35/299. This was \nthe common position put forward by nine Heads of State and Government and Ministers for \nForeign Affairs of the European Community in Venice, in June 1980. \n46 For instance UN resolution 3005 passed 15 th September 1972: 'The General Assembly.... \naffirms the Principle of the sovereignty of the population of the occupied territories over their \nnational wealth and resource \n... \nCalls upon all States, international organizations and \nspecialized agencies not to recognize or cooperate with, or assist in any manner in, any \nmeasures undertaken by the occupying Power to exploit the resources of the occupied \nterritories \n.... \nRequests the Secretary-General [to investigate] The exploitation and the \nlooting of the resources of the occupied territories' \n47 It is also likely that Blair's visit to Syria provided an opening to discuss the \nPalestinian/Arab perspective without attracting pressure from the pro-Israel lobby. Reporting \non the perspective of the Syrian president during a visit by a British Prime Minister is \nunlikely to attract the degree of intimidation and pressure that broadcasters could face if they \nwere to report that ordinary Palestinians viewed the Israelis as 'state terrorists', and suicide \nbombers as 'freedom fighters'. \n224 \nReferences \nAham, A.

The operation marks a significant escalation in tensions, with global repercussions for diplomacy, regional stability, and civilian safety.\n\n---\n\n#### **Key Findings** \n1. **Operation Scope**: Strikes targeted Iranian military, nuclear, and government sites, including areas near Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei’s office and a girls’ primary school in Minab (reporting 53 deaths). \n2. **Retaliation**: Iran launched missiles at US and Israeli assets in Bahrain, Israel (Haifa), Qatar, Jordan, and the UAE, with varying interception success. \n3. **Humanitarian Impact**: Civilian casualties and displacement are reported, with international bodies emphasizing violations of humanitarian law. \n4. **Global Reactions**: Condemnation from the UN, EU, Russia, and cautious statements from allies like the UK, France, and Australia. \n\n---\n\n#### **Key Facts and Data** \n- **Timing**: Strikes began around 06:00 GMT (09:30 Tehran time) on the reported date. \n- **Targets**: \n - Iranian cities: Tehran, Isfahan, Qom, Karaj, Kermanshah. \n - Suspected nuclear sites (e.g., Leadership House near Khamenei’s office). \n - US Navy 5th Fleet in Bahrain and Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. \n- **Casualties**: At least 53 killed in a school strike (unverified by BBC); Israeli reports cite 24 deaths from Iranian retaliation. \n- **Travel Disruptions**: Airspace closures in Iran, Israel, Jordan, Iraq, and UAE; flight suspensions by Lufthansa, Wizz Air, and Virgin Atlantic. \n\n---\n\n#### **Notable Verbatim Quotes** \n1. **Donald Trump**: *“Our objective is to defend the American people by eliminating imminent threats from the Iranian regime.”* \n2. **Benjamin Netanyahu**: Urged Iranians to *“throw off the yoke of tyranny and bring about a free and peaceful Iran.”* \n3. **Iranian FM Abbas Araghchi**: Condemned strikes as *“wholly unprovoked, illegal, and illegitimate.”* \n\n---\n\n#### **Framing and Perspective** \nThe BBC adopts a neutral tone, emphasizing verified reports while cautioning about unconfirmed claims (e.g., school strike casualties).

              "reasoning": "Okay, let me tackle this query step by step. The user wants an analysis of the provided source material about Israel from a Centrist perspective. The source material includes multiple articles detailing joint US-Israel military strikes on Iran, their targets, casualties, and geopolitical implications.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the main points related to Israel. The summary mentions the joint attack targeting Iran's military, nuclear, and government sites. Key findings include the scope of the operation, retaliation by Iran, humanitarian impact, and global reactions. There are specifics like targeting Supreme Leader Khamenei's office and a school in Minab with casualties. Also, quotes from Trump and Netanyahu are important.\n\nNext, the terms section requires identifying 8-10 terms central to Israel's role. From the sources, terms like \"Pre-emptive Attack\", \"Nuclear Capabilities\", \"Military Targets\", \"Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei\", \"Civilian Casualties\", \"Ballistic Missile Retaliation\", \"Humanitarian Law Violations\", \"Diplomatic De-escalation\", \"Regional Stability\", and \"Operation Epic Fury\" come up. Each needs a centrality score based on how central they are to the portrayal of Israel. For example, \"Pre-emptive Attack\" is central as the operation is framed as such.\n\nFor claims or findings, I need concise statements backed by the source. Examples include Israel collaborating with the US in attacking Iran, targeting nuclear sites, causing civilian casualties, facing Iranian retaliation, and global calls for de-escalation. Each claim must trace back to the source material.\n\nCitations must link directly to the source content. The BBC article mentions Netanyahu urging Iranians to overthrow their government, which supports the claim of collaboration. Reuters reports on strikes targeting Khamenei and nuclear facilities. TIME discusses US involvement denial, which ties into the collaboration claim. KPBS mentions Israel's right to retaliate, affecting regional stability. Each citation requires a snippet, relevance, source type, and linked terms.\n\nConfidence notes should address unverified casualty figures and reliance on media reports, which may have biases. The lack of independent verification for some claims is a limitation.\n\nI need to ensure every term and claim is explicitly mentioned in the sources. Avoid introducing new concepts. Check that centrality scores reflect the source's emphasis. For example, \"Nuclear Capabilities\" is central due to repeated mentions of targeting nuclear sites. Citations should use the provided URLs and quotes, keeping snippets under 25 words. Finally, compile everything into the required JSON structure without markdown.\n",

The summary mentions the joint attack targeting Iran's military, nuclear, and government sites. Key findings include the scope of the operation, retaliation by Iran, humanitarian impact, and global reactions. There are specifics like targeting Supreme Leader Khamenei's office and a school in Minab with casualties. Also, quotes from Trump and Netanyahu are important.\n\nNext, the terms section requires identifying 8-10 terms central to Israel's role. From the sources, terms like \"Pre-emptive Attack\", \"Nuclear Capabilities\", \"Military Targets\", \"Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei\", \"Civilian Casualties\", \"Ballistic Missile Retaliation\", \"Humanitarian Law Violations\", \"Diplomatic De-escalation\", \"Regional Stability\", and \"Operation Epic Fury\" come up. Each needs a centrality score based on how central they are to the portrayal of Israel. For example, \"Pre-emptive Attack\" is central as the operation is framed as such.\n\nFor claims or findings, I need concise statements backed by the source. Examples include Israel collaborating with the US in attacking Iran, targeting nuclear sites, causing civilian casualties, facing Iranian retaliation, and global calls for de-escalation. Each claim must trace back to the source material.\n\nCitations must link directly to the source content. The BBC article mentions Netanyahu urging Iranians to overthrow their government, which supports the claim of collaboration. Reuters reports on strikes targeting Khamenei and nuclear facilities. TIME discusses US involvement denial, which ties into the collaboration claim. KPBS mentions Israel's right to retaliate, affecting regional stability. Each citation requires a snippet, relevance, source type, and linked terms.\n\nConfidence notes should address unverified casualty figures and reliance on media reports, which may have biases. The lack of independent verification for some claims is a limitation.\n\nI need to ensure every term and claim is explicitly mentioned in the sources. Avoid introducing new concepts. Check that centrality scores reflect the source's emphasis. For example, \"Nuclear Capabilities\" is central due to repeated mentions of targeting nuclear sites. Citations should use the provided URLs and quotes, keeping snippets under 25 words. Finally, compile everything into the required JSON structure without markdown.\n"

Explosions also rang out in nearby oil-producing [Gulf Arab countries], which said they had intercepted missiles from Iran after Tehran warned it would strike the region if it was attacked.\n\nSign up [here.] \n\nThe first wave of strikes in what the Pentagon named \"OPERATION EPIC FURY\" mainly targeted Iranian officials, a source familiar with the matter said.\n\nAn Israeli official said Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Masoud Pezeshkian were both targeted but the result of the strikes was not clear. A source with knowledge of the matter had earlier told Reuters that Khamenei was not in Tehran and had been transferred to a secure location.\n\nAn Iranian source close to the establishment said several senior commanders in Iran's Revolutionary Guards and political officials had been killed. Forty people were killed in an Israeli airstrike on a school, state media said. Reuters could not independently confirm the reports.\n\n## HOPES DIM FOR DIPLOMATIC SOLUTION TO NUCLEAR DISPUTE\n\nThe renewed confrontation between Iran and its long-time foes dimmed hopes of a diplomatic solution to Tehran's nuclear dispute with the West. The latest indirect talks between the U.S. and Iran this week failed to produce a breakthrough.\n\nIran's Revolutionary Guards said all [U.S. bases] and interests in the region were within Iran's reach and that the retaliation would continue until \"the enemy is decisively defeated\".\n\nIran's foreign minister told counterparts from Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain and Iraq that Tehran would use all its defensive and military capabilities to defend itself.\n\nLoud booms sounded in the United Arab Emirates capital Abu Dhabi, an oil producer and U.S. ally. Fighter jets flew around the Yas Island area of Abu Dhabi on Saturday afternoon and blasts were heard in the country's business capital Dubai.\n\nBahrain said the service center of the U.S. Fifth Fleet had been subjected to a missile attack. Video footage from witnesses in Bahrain showed a thick grey plume of smoke rising from near the small island state's coastline as sirens wailed.\n\nFellow Gulf Arab state Qatar said it had downed all missiles targeting the country and that it had a right to respond. Sirens were later heard in its capital Doha.\n\nExplosions were heard near Iran's Kharg Island. Iran exports 90 percent of its crude oil via Kharg, for shipping through the narrow Strait of Hormuz.\n\n[Global airlines] cancelled flights across the Middle East and the attacks raised the prospect of oil prices rising.\n\n\"If we don’t see signs of de-escalation over the weekend, risk premiums could still drive Brent (crude) up by $10–$20/bbl (a barrel) on Monday,\" said Jorge Leon, head of geopolitical analysis at Rystad Energy.\n\n## TRUMP CITES 1979 HOSTAGE CRISIS\n\nItem 1 of 11 Smoke rises in the sky after blasts were heard in Manama, Bahrain, February 28, 2026.

REUTERS/Stringer [Purchase Licensing Rights, opens new tab] \n\nIn a video message published on social media, [Trump] cited Washington's decades-old dispute with Iran, including the seizure of the 1979 U.S. embassy in Tehran, when students held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days, as well as a range of other attacks the U.S. has blamed on Iran since the 1979 Islamic revolution brought the clerics to power.\n\nHe urged Iranians to stay sheltered because \"bombs will be dropping everywhere\". But he also added: \"When we are finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take. This will be probably your only chance for generations.”\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the joint U.S.-Israeli attack \"will create the conditions for the brave Iranian people to take their destiny into their own hands\" and \" remove the yoke of tyranny\". Defence Minister Israel Katz called it a pre-emptive strike to remove threats to Israel.\n\nThe scope of the U.S. air and sea operations was not immediately clear. The campaign is expected to last for multiple days, a U.S. official said.\n\nIn Tehran, witnesses said people were rushing to banks to withdraw cash. Long queues formed at gas stations across cities. Many also worried about a potential internet blackout that would cut off communication with their families abroad.\n\n“We are being killed by the regime and by Israel. We are the victims of this regime’s hostile policies,” said Maryam, 54, a [housewife in Tehran], as she headed to northern Iran with her family.\n\nIsrael's military did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the strike at a primary school for girls southern Iran, where Iranian state media reported 40 deaths.\n\nIraq's Iran-aligned armed group Kataib Hezbollah said it would soon attack U.S. bases in the region.\n\n## US MILITARY BUILDUP\n\n[Trump] had built up a vast U.S. military presence in the region to try to force Tehran to make concessions in the nuclear talks. He said the \"massive\" operation was intended to ensure Tehran does not obtain a nuclear weapon.\n\nThe U.S. and Iran renewed negotiations in February on the nuclear dispute. Iran, which denies seeking atomic bombs, said it was prepared to discuss curbs on its nuclear programme in exchange for lifting [sanctions] but ruled out linking the issue to missiles.\n\nIran's ballistic missile programme has been a significant sticking point, with Trump saying Tehran was developing long-range missiles that threaten the U.S.\n\n\"Our objective is to defend the American people by eliminating imminent threats from the Iranian regime,\" Trump said.\n\nThe attacks follows a 12-day air war last June between Israel and Iran and repeated U.S.-Israeli warnings that they would strike again if Iran pressed ahead with its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.\n\nAn Israeli defence official said the operation had been planned for months in coordination with Washington, and that the launch date was decided weeks ago.\n\nThe Israeli military announced the [closure of schools] and workplaces, with exceptions for essential sectors, and a ban on public airspace. Israel closed its airspace to civilian flights.\n\nReporting by Reuters bureaux; Writing by Michael Georgy; Editing by Barbara Lewis, Sam Holmes and Timothy Heritage\n\nOur Standards: [The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles., opens new tab] \n\n[Purchase Licensing Rights] \n\n[Alexander Cornwell] \n\nThomson Reuters\n\nAlexander has over a decade of international reporting experience.

No. Until they do we’re not even talking about going after the political leadership,” one official told[Reuters].\nIsrael has denied such a plan, but the reported rejection by Trump would indicate some amount of coordination between the U.S. and Israel.\nThe attack on Iran came amid protracted talks between the U.S. and Iran centered around[Iran’s nuclear program]. Trump has[emphasized] finding a diplomatic solution to the conflict, touting his self-professed ability to broker peace, but Iran and Israel have so far shrugged off international calls for deescalation as both sides launched new attacks early Monday.\nIran has vowed to retaliate against the U.S., too, while Trump has[warned]: “If we are attacked in any way, shape, or form by Iran, the full strength and might of the U.S. Armed Forces will come down on you at levels never seen before.”\nAdvertisement\nHere’s what to know about U.S. involvement so far.\n## “Nothing to do with the attack”\nIsrael launched its attacks, dubbed “Operation Rising Lion,” early Friday, targeting Iran’s nuclear facilities as well as[military leaders and nuclear scientists] and promising that strikes “will continue for as many days as it takes to remove this threat” of Iran’s nuclear program. Iran launched[retaliatory strikes] at Tel Aviv and Jerusalem on Friday evening and have continued to fire missiles at the country.\nIran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi[said] Iran has “solid evidence” that the U.S. provided support for Israel’s attacks. Iran’s Foreign Ministry said in a[statement] that the attacks “could not have been carried out without coordination with and approval of the United States,” adding that the U.S. will be “held responsible for the dangerous consequences of Israel’s adventurism.”\nThe U.S. has denied any involvement in Israel’s strikes, a position that the Trump Administration has repeated multiple times since Friday.\nAdvertisement\n“We are not involved in strikes against Iran and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region,” Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a[statement] released soon after the strikes started, describing the attack as “unilateral action” by Israel. Rubio admitted Israel had informed the Trump Administration of the attack, which both Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have also[reiterated]. The U.S.[evacuated] embassy staff from across the region the day before the attack last week.\nIn a post on Truth Social urging Iran to “make a deal,” Trump[suggested] Friday that he was also aware of “the next already planned attacks,” which would be “even more brutal.” Later that day, when asked by the*Wall Street Journal*if he was given a heads-up about the initial attacks by Israel, he suggested that description was an understatement,[responding]: “Heads-up? It wasn’t a heads-up. It was, we know what’s going on.”\nAdvertisement\nBut on Saturday night, following further strikes, Trump again[posted]: “The U.S. had nothing to do with the attack on Iran, tonight.”\n## “Clear U.S. green light”\n[Israel’s attack] had been months in the making. Reports in May of[Israel’s preparations to strike Iran] suggested that the Trump Administration would not assist Israel in such an operation, especially as Washington was in the midst of negotiating a nuclear agreement with Tehran.\nBut news outlet[Axios reported] Friday that Israeli officials said the strikes were in fact coordinated with the U.S., claiming that the Trump Administration publicly pretended to oppose an Israeli attack but gave Israel a “clear U.S. green light” in private.\nAccording to the latest reports, the U.S. has even intervened to shape the attack. U.S. officials told Reuters, the[Associated Press],[CNN], and others that Israel had informed the Trump Administration of a credible plan to assassinate Khamenei and that the White House waved Israel off the plan.\nAdvertisement\nNetanyahu spokesperson Omer Dostri later denied those reports,[calling] them “fake.” “There’s so many false reports of conversations that never happened, and I’m not going to get into that,” Netanyahu said when asked about it on[Fox News] on Sunday. “But I can tell you,” he continued, “we’ll do what we need to do. And I think the United States knows what is good for the United States.”\nThe unclear messaging about the extent of U.S. involvement, however, could reflect mixed priorities between the U.S. and Israel.\nTrita Parsi, executive vice president of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft and an expert on U.S.-Iran relations,[told] NPR that “clearly there had been coordination and some form of a green light” by the Trump Administration for the Israeli strikes.\n“Trump is making a major gamble here, thinking that this actually will soften the Iranian position and make them capitulate,” Parsi added. “If they don’t, what are his options? And this is where I think the Israelis are hoping that the Iranians will not capitulate and that will force the United States into the war.”\n## Must-Reads from TIME\n* [Iran Vows ‘Painful’ Response After Israeli Attack: What to Know] \n* [Trump Issues Grave Warning to Iran After Israeli Strikes: ‘No More Death, No More Destruction’] \n* [Netanyahu Says Israel ‘Will Strike Every Site of the Ayatollah’s Regime’ in Warning to Iran as Countries Trade Missiles] \n* [The Tense History and Modern Context Behind Israel’s Reported Plan to Attack Iran] ****[more.] \n* [U.S. Evacuates Embassy Staff From Middle East Amid Israel-Iran Tensions] \n* [The Tense History and Modern Context Behind Israel’s Reported Plan to Attack Iran]"

(AP Photo)] \nAP\nPeople observe a mosque destroyed by Israeli airstrikes in the city of Khan Younis, sothern Gaza Strip, Friday, Oct. 25, 2024. (AP Photo)\nIsrael launched airstrikes early Saturday on what it described as military targets in Iran in[retaliation for a ballistic missile] assault Oct. 1, officials said. There was no immediate information on damage in the Islamic Republic.\nThe attack, threatened for weeks by Israel, comes as the Middle East sits on the precipice of a regional war more than a year after[an initial attack by the militant group Hamas] on Israel. In the time since, Israel has launched a devastating ground offensive in the Gaza Strip and an invasion of neighboring Lebanon, targeting militants long armed and aided by Tehran.\nIsrael's military described the attack Saturday as “precise strikes on military targets in Iran,” without immediately elaborating.\nAdvertisement\n[Become a KPBS sponsor] \n“The regime in Iran and its proxies in the region have been relentlessly attacking Israel since Oct. 7 ... including direct attacks from Iranian soil,” an Israeli military statement said. “Like every other sovereign country in the world, the State of Israel has the right and the duty to respond.”\nIn Tehran, the Iranian capital, the sound of explosions could be heard, with state-run media there initially acknowledging the blasts and saying some of the sounds came from air defense systems around the city.\nA Tehran resident told The Associated Press that at least seven explosions could be heard, which rattled the surrounding area. The resident spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.\nInternational flights began diverting around western Iran as news of the strikes broke, flight-tracking data showed.\nMeanwhile, state media in Syria described its air defenses as targeting “hostile targets” there as well.\nAdvertisement\n[Become a KPBS sponsor] \nIran has launched two ballistic missile attacks on Israel in recent months amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip that began with the Hamas attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. That initial attack killed some 1,200 people and saw 250 others taken hostage back to the seaside enclave.\nIn the time since, more than 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, according to local health officials who don't delineate between civilians and combatants. Israeli military operations in the West Bank in the time since have killed hundreds more.\nIsrael also has launched a ground invasion of Lebanon and a series of punishing airstrikes that have rattled that country.\nThe strike Saturday happened just as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was arriving back in the U.S. after a tour of the Middle East where he and other U.S. officials had warned Israel to tender a response that would not further escalate the conflict in the region and exclude nuclear sites in Iran.\nWhite House National Security Council spokesman Sean Savett said in a statement that “we understand that Israel is conducting targeted strikes against military targets in Iran” and referred reporters to the Israeli government for more details on their operation.\nTwo U.S. officials said the U.S. was notified by Israel in advance of the strikes. They said there was no U.S. involvement in the operation. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing operation.\nIsrael had vowed to hit Iran hard following a[massive Iranian missile barrage] on Oct. 1. Iran said its barrage was in response to deadly Israeli[attacks against its proxy in Lebanon,] Hezbollah, and it has promised to respond to any retaliatory strikes.\nIsrael and Iran have been bitter foes since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Israel considers Iran to be its greatest threat, citing its leaders’ calls for Israel’s destruction, their support for anti-Israel militant groups and the country’s nuclear program.\nIsrael and Iran have been locked in a yearslong shadow war. A suspected Israeli assassination campaign has killed top Iranian nuclear scientists. Iranian nuclear installations have been hacked or sabotaged, all in mysterious attacks blamed on Israel. Meanwhile, Iran has been blamed for a series of attacks on shipping in the Middle East in recent years, which later grew into the attacks by Yemen's Houthi rebels on shipping through the Red Sea corridor.\nBut since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack, the battle has increasingly moved into the open. Israel has recently turned its attention to Hezbollah, which has been firing rockets into Israel since[the war in Gaza] began. Throughout the year, a number of top Iranian military figures have been killed in Israeli strikes in Syria and Lebanon.\nIran fired a wave of missiles and drones at Israel last April after two Iranian generals were killed in an apparent Israeli airstrike in Syria on an Iranian diplomatic post. The missiles and drones caused minimum damage, and Israel —under pressure from Western countries to show restraint —responded with a limited strike.\nBut after Iran’s early October missile strike, Israel promised a tougher response.\n[International] \nTrending\n* [📚 Library cuts?] \n* [📝 Prop 1] \n* [🏛 SD juvenile hall investigation] \nSign up for our newsletters!\nKeep up with all the latest news, arts and culture, and TV highlights from KPBS.\nEmail address\\*\nToday's Top Stories\nTV Highlights\nThe Catch Up\nKPBS/Arts\nKPBS' Most Popular\nKPBS Streaming Picks\nNorth County Focus\nSubscribe\nLATEST IN PODCASTS\n[![]] \n1.

It was published,” Benjamin Netanyahu told the Israeli parliament. “There is a specific component in their nuclear programme that was hit.”\nHe gave no details, but last week Axios[reported that a “nuclear weapons research facility” making plastic explosives at the Parchin military complex was destroyed].\nThere was no immediate comment from Iran, but it has previously said the Israeli strikes caused limited damage to radar systems and that its nuclear activities are entirely peaceful.\nIran has also insisted that it does not seek nuclear weapons, although evidence collected by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) suggests that until 2003 it conducted activities relevant to the development of a bomb. The agency says Iran has not yet answered outstanding questions related to its nuclear activity.\nThe IAEA also says Iran has produced enough highly enriched uranium to build several nuclear weapons since the US abandoned a nuclear deal and reinstated crippling sanctions six years ago with Netanyahu’s support.\nOn 26 October, the Israeli military announced it had conducted “precise strikes on military targets in Iran” in response to the 1 October attack that saw almost 200 ballistic missiles launched towards Israel.\nThe military said the targets included missile manufacturing facilities, as well as surface-to-air missile arrays and aerial capabilities intended to restrict Israel’s freedom of operation inside Iran.\nIran’s military said the attacks caused “limited and minor damage” to several radar systems and that four Iranian military officers and one civilian were killed. Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said the effect of the attacks should not be “magnified or downplayed”.\n[Satellite images analysed by the BBC showed damage to four structures at Parchin], about 30km (18.5 miles) east of Tehran.\nExperts from the Institute for Science and International Security said three of the structures were related to missile production, and that[the fourth, known as Taleghan 2, was previously involved in high explosive testing related to the development of nuclear weapons].\nAxios’s report cited unnamed US and Israeli officials as saying that intelligence services had detected recent activity at the Taleghan 2 facility that was “part of an effort inside the Iranian government to conduct research that could be used for the development of nuclear weapons but could also be presented as research for civilian purposes”.\nOne former Israeli official said the strike destroyed “sophisticated equipment used to design the plastic explosives that surround uranium in a nuclear device and are needed to detonate it”, according to the report.\nBenjamin Netanyahu told Israel’s parliament that “a nuclear Iran poses a massive threat to our existence, to the peace agreements we aim to achieve with more of our neighbours and to global peace”.\n“We will be tested on our ability to thwart their nuclear ambitions,” he added.\nHe then mentioned the attack on the “specific component” of Iran’s nuclear programme before warning that the “programme itself, its capacity to act here, has not yet been thwarted”.\nBefore the Israeli strikes took place, US President Joe Biden had said publicly that he did not support attacks on Iran’s nuclear or oil facilities.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump, who is expected to take a harder line with Iran when he takes office in January, meanwhile said he had advised Netanyahu to “hit the nuclear first and worry about the rest later”.\nLast week, Iranian President Massoud Pezeshkian told the head of the IAEA, Rafael Grossi, that Iran was committed to resolving “doubts and ambiguities” surrounding its nuclear activities.\nMr Grossi visited Tehran ahead of a meeting of the IAEA’s board of governors this week, at which the UK, France and Germany are expected to pass a resolution critical of Iran’s co-operation.\nIranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi warned that Tehran would &quot;take countermeasures and new actions in our nuclear programme&quot; in response to any such resolution.\nHe also strongly denied media reports that Iran’s ambassador to the UN, Amir Saeed Iravani, had met Trump ally Elon Musk to defuse US-Iran tensions.\n“We are still waiting for the new US administration to clarify its policies, and based on that, we will adjust our own policies. Right now, it is neither the time for such meetings nor is it appropriate,&quot; he said.\n[Israel] \n[Iran] \n[Iran nuclear deal] \nRelated\n[\n## UN agency runs out of food aid in Gaza after Israeli blockade\n2 days ago\nMiddle East\n] \n[\n## Israel&#x27;s muted response to Pope Francis&#x27;s death signals tensions over Gaza\n2 days ago\nMiddle East\n] \n[\n## Israeli military admits its troops killed UN worker in Gaza Strip\n2 days ago\nWorld\n] \nMore\n[\n3 hrs ago\n![]![Emergency workers standing in front of a large, black cloud of smoke] \n## Huge blast at key Iranian port kills 28 and injures 800\nOne maritime risk firm says it believes the affected containers held solid fuel for use in ballistic missiles.\n3 hrs ago\nMiddle East\n] \n[\n21 hrs ago\n![]![A fireball seen from the viewpoint of a driver in front of a row of cars] \n## Moment driver sees huge explosion rip through Iran port\nAt least four people have been killed and 500 more injured in Bandar Abbas.\n21 hrs ago\nMiddle East\n] \n[\n8 days ago\n![]![Iran&#x27;s President Masoud Pezeshkian (centre) visits a nuclear exhibition in Tehran, 9 April 2025] \n## Hopes for Iran nuclear talks tempered by threats and mixed messages\nIranian and US officials agree to continue with a third round of high-stakes talks on a new nuclear deal.\n8 days ago\nWorld\n] \n[\n12 Apr 2025\n![]![US envoy Steve Witkoff on the left and Iran&#x27;s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on the right] \n## US and Iran hold &#x27;constructive&#x27; first round of nuclear talks\nThe highest-level talks between the two nations since Trump&#x27;s first term in office will resume next week.\n12 Apr 2025\nMiddle East\n] \n[\n12 Apr 2025\n![]![A worker wearing a white hard hat rides a bicycle in front of the reactor building of the Bushehr nuclear power plant, just outside the southern city of Bushehr, Iran, in October 2010. ] \n## What is Iran&#x27;s nuclear programme and what does the US want?\nDonald Trump has suggested Iran could face military action if it does not agree to a new nuclear deal.\n12 Apr 2025\nWorld\n]"

The operation, framed by President Donald Trump as “major combat operations,” aims to dismantle Iran’s military infrastructure and nuclear program while explicitly advocating for regime change.

              "reasoning": "Okay, I need to analyze the given source material about Israel from a Center-Left perspective. First, I'll start by summarizing how the sources portray Israel. The sources mention joint military operations with the U.S., targeting Iranian leadership and infrastructure, and Netanyahu's goal of enabling regime change. There's also reference to regional instability and humanitarian impacts.\n\nLooking for key terms, \"Joint Military Operations\" is central because the sources repeatedly mention U.S. and Israel collaborating. \"Regime Change Advocacy\" comes from Trump and Netanyahu's statements urging Iranians to overthrow their government. \"State of Emergency\" is declared by Israel, so that's a key term. \"Supreme Leader Targeting\" refers to attacks on Khamenei. \"Nuclear Program Dismantling\" is cited as a reason for the strikes. \"Regional Defensive Measures\" like Gulf states activating air defenses show spillover effects. \"Humanitarian Toll\" is mentioned with casualties in a school. \"Retaliatory Strikes\" by Iran indicate escalation. Each term's centrality should reflect how prominently they appear in the sources.\n\nFor claims or findings, the joint military action with the U.S. is a primary claim. The explicit targeting of Iranian leadership supports another. The humanitarian impact from civilian casualties is another finding. The regional instability caused by missile interceptions and state of emergency is a fourth claim. Each needs a citation from the sources.\n\nCitations must tie back to the sources. For example, the Washington Post URL is used, but I need to check if the provided sources include it. Wait, the user provided a source from Washington Post in the example, but the actual sources given are from Foreign Policy, Globe and Mail, NPR, HRW, and Reuters. Wait, the user's query includes a block of web search results with multiple sources. The example answer they provided includes a \"SOURCE MATERIAL\" section which is a summary from The Washington Post, but in the actual web search results provided, the URLs are foreignpolicy.com, theglobeandmail.com, npr.org, hrw.org, and reuters.com. \n\nWait, confusion here. The user provided a section starting with \"SOURCE MATERIAL — quote and cite specific passages...\" which is a summary from The Washington Post. But in the initial web search results, the sources are Foreign Policy, Globe and Mail, NPR, HRW, and Reuters. However, in the user's latest query, the source material they provided is structured as a Washington Post article. But looking back, the actual sources in the web search results include Foreign Policy, The Globe and Mail, NPR, HRW, and Reuters. However, the user's input seems to have a block that starts with \"--- SOURCE: U.S. and Israel strike Iran in joint attack; Tehran retaliates: Live updates - The Washington Post ---\", indicating that the source material is a Washington Post article. However, in the initial web results provided, there's no Washington Post article. The user might have included a hypothetical source for the example. The actual task is to analyze based on the provided web search results, which include the five sources listed (Foreign Policy, Globe and Mail, NPR, HRW, Reuters). But in the user's SOURCE MATERIAL section, they reference The Washington Post. This is conflicting. Wait, perhaps the user included a made-up source for the example, but the actual sources to analyze are the ones in the web search results provided earlier. However, the user's latest query's source material is a Washington Post summary. Hmm. This is a bit confusing. But based on the user's instruction, they provided a SOURCE MATERIAL block that is from The Washington Post, even though it's not in the initial web results. Therefore, I need to base the analysis on that provided SOURCE MATERIAL block, which is a summary from The Washington Post. The actual web search results provided earlier might not be part of the immediate analysis. The user's instructions say: \"You have been given real source material. Analyze it about 'israel' from the perspective of Center-Left. Refer explicitly to what the sources say.\" And the SOURCE MATERIAL they provided is a Washington Post summary. Therefore, the citations should be based on that. But the problem is that the user's example includes a URL from washingtonpost.com, but in the provided web search results, that URL isn't present. However, the user's SOURCE MATERIAL block includes it. So perhaps the user is providing a hypothetical scenario where the source is a Washington Post article. Therefore, the citations would reference that hypothetical URL. However, in the actual task, the user's provided web search results include other sources. Wait, the user's latest input starts with \"You have been given real source material. Analyze it about 'israel' from the perspective of Center-Left. Refer explicitly to what the sources say.\" Then they provide a SOURCE MATERIAL section that is a summary from The Washington Post. Therefore, all the analysis should be based on that provided SOURCE MATERIAL, not the initial web search results. The initial web search results might have been part of a previous step, but the current query is about the provided SOURCE MATERIAL. Thus, in the answer, the citations should reference the Washington Post URL provided in the SOURCE MATERIAL. However, the user's example answer includes citations from the web search results. Wait, this is confusing. Let me re-examine the user's exact instructions. The user's query includes a section titled \"SOURCE MATERIAL — quote and cite specific passages; ground every term and claim in what these sources actually say\" followed by a block of text that is a summary from The Washington Post, ending with a Source URL: washingtonpost.com. Therefore, the task is to analyze this SOURCE MATERIAL (the Washington Post article summary) and base the JSON response on that. The initial web search results provided earlier might be part of the context but the immediate analysis is on the provided SOURCE MATERIAL. Therefore, the citations should be based on the Washington Post source. However, the user's example answer includes citations from other sources, but perhaps that's part of the example.

Let's proceed accordingly.\n\nThe summary from the Center-Left perspective would note Israel's role in a joint military operation with the U.S., the targeting of Iranian leadership and infrastructure, the declaration of a state of emergency, and the regional repercussions.

Each citation needs a quote or snippet from the source material. For example, the quote from Trump about \"major combat operations\" supports the regime change advocacy. The state of emergency is mentioned with Israel declaring it. The humanitarian toll is noted in casualties. Regional impact includes Gulf states activating defenses.\n\nConfidence notes should mention that the analysis is based solely on the provided Washington Post summary and lacks corroboration from other sources.\n",

                  "text": "Okay, I need to analyze the given source material about Israel from a Center-Left perspective. First, I'll start by summarizing how the sources portray Israel. The sources mention joint military operations with the U.S., targeting Iranian leadership and infrastructure, and Netanyahu's goal of enabling regime change. There's also reference to regional instability and humanitarian impacts.\n\nLooking for key terms, \"Joint Military Operations\" is central because the sources repeatedly mention U.S. and Israel collaborating. \"Regime Change Advocacy\" comes from Trump and Netanyahu's statements urging Iranians to overthrow their government. \"State of Emergency\" is declared by Israel, so that's a key term. \"Supreme Leader Targeting\" refers to attacks on Khamenei. \"Nuclear Program Dismantling\" is cited as a reason for the strikes. \"Regional Defensive Measures\" like Gulf states activating air defenses show spillover effects. \"Humanitarian Toll\" is mentioned with casualties in a school. \"Retaliatory Strikes\" by Iran indicate escalation. Each term's centrality should reflect how prominently they appear in the sources.\n\nFor claims or findings, the joint military action with the U.S. is a primary claim. The explicit targeting of Iranian leadership supports another. The humanitarian impact from civilian casualties is another finding. The regional instability caused by missile interceptions and state of emergency is a fourth claim. Each needs a citation from the sources.\n\nCitations must tie back to the sources. For example, the Washington Post URL is used, but I need to check if the provided sources include it. Wait, the user provided a source from Washington Post in the example, but the actual sources given are from Foreign Policy, Globe and Mail, NPR, HRW, and Reuters. Wait, the user's query includes a block of web search results with multiple sources. The example answer they provided includes a \"SOURCE MATERIAL\" section which is a summary from The Washington Post, but in the actual web search results provided, the URLs are foreignpolicy.com, theglobeandmail.com, npr.org, hrw.org, and reuters.com. \n\nWait, confusion here. The user provided a section starting with \"SOURCE MATERIAL — quote and cite specific passages...\" which is a summary from The Washington Post. But in the initial web search results, the sources are Foreign Policy, Globe and Mail, NPR, HRW, and Reuters. However, in the user's latest query, the source material they provided is structured as a Washington Post article. But looking back, the actual sources in the web search results include Foreign Policy, The Globe and Mail, NPR, HRW, and Reuters. However, the user's input seems to have a block that starts with \"--- SOURCE: U.S. and Israel strike Iran in joint attack; Tehran retaliates: Live updates - The Washington Post ---\", indicating that the source material is a Washington Post article. However, in the initial web results provided, there's no Washington Post article. The user might have included a hypothetical source for the example. The actual task is to analyze based on the provided web search results, which include the five sources listed (Foreign Policy, Globe and Mail, NPR, HRW, Reuters). But in the user's SOURCE MATERIAL section, they reference The Washington Post. This is conflicting. Wait, perhaps the user included a made-up source for the example, but the actual sources to analyze are the ones in the web search results provided earlier. However, the user's latest query's source material is a Washington Post summary. Hmm. This is a bit confusing. But based on the user's instruction, they provided a SOURCE MATERIAL block that is from The Washington Post, even though it's not in the initial web results. Therefore, I need to base the analysis on that provided SOURCE MATERIAL block, which is a summary from The Washington Post. The actual web search results provided earlier might not be part of the immediate analysis. The user's instructions say: \"You have been given real source material. Analyze it about 'israel' from the perspective of Center-Left. Refer explicitly to what the sources say.\" And the SOURCE MATERIAL they provided is a Washington Post summary. Therefore, the citations should be based on that. But the problem is that the user's example includes a URL from washingtonpost.com, but in the provided web search results, that URL isn't present. However, the user's SOURCE MATERIAL block includes it. So perhaps the user is providing a hypothetical scenario where the source is a Washington Post article. Therefore, the citations would reference that hypothetical URL. However, in the actual task, the user's provided web search results include other sources. Wait, the user's latest input starts with \"You have been given real source material. Analyze it about 'israel' from the perspective of Center-Left. Refer explicitly to what the sources say.\" Then they provide a SOURCE MATERIAL section that is a summary from The Washington Post. Therefore, all the analysis should be based on that provided SOURCE MATERIAL, not the initial web search results. The initial web search results might have been part of a previous step, but the current query is about the provided SOURCE MATERIAL. Thus, in the answer, the citations should reference the Washington Post URL provided in the SOURCE MATERIAL. However, the user's example answer includes citations from the web search results. Wait, this is confusing. Let me re-examine the user's exact instructions. The user's query includes a section titled \"SOURCE MATERIAL — quote and cite specific passages; ground every term and claim in what these sources actually say\" followed by a block of text that is a summary from The Washington Post, ending with a Source URL: washingtonpost.com. Therefore, the task is to analyze this SOURCE MATERIAL (the Washington Post article summary) and base the JSON response on that. The initial web search results provided earlier might be part of the context but the immediate analysis is on the provided SOURCE MATERIAL. Therefore, the citations should be based on the Washington Post source. However, the user's example answer includes citations from other sources, but perhaps that's part of the example.

And we’re not gonna put up with it any longer,” Trump said.\nHe also cited the country’s nuclear program, which has been the focus of intense negotiations in recent weeks. “They’ve rejected every opportunity to renounce their nuclear ambitions, and we can’t take it anymore,” Trump said. He did not mention that Iran in 2015 signed a comprehensive agreement with the United States and several other world powers that put strict, verifiable limits on its nuclear program, or that the country was in compliance with the deal when Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from it in 2018. \n“For these reasons, the United States military is undertaking a massive and ongoing operation to prevent this very wicked, radical dictatorship from threatening America and our core national security interests. We are going to destroy their missiles and raze their missile industry to the ground,” Trump said. “We are going to annihilate their navy, we are going to ensure that the region’s terrorist proxies can no longer destabilize the region and the world. … And we will ensure that Iran does not obtain a nuclear weapon.”\nTrump also called on the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as well as Iran’s armed forces and police to “lay down your weapons and have complete immunity or you will face certain death.”\nAnd he exhorted the Iranian people to stay safe and sheltered during the U.S. operation—but to rise up against the regime once the U.S. operation has ended. “To the great, proud people of Iran, I say to you tonight, the hour of your freedom is at hand. When we are finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take.”\n## Read More\n*\n[![A young woman walks beneath a cloudy sky while carrying a rocket constructed from cardboard and paper over her head; a man walks behind her while holding up the back of the rocket.

An Israeli defense official told Reuters that the operation had been planned for months in coordination with Washington and that the launch date was decided weeks ago.\nIran has responded with [ballistic missile barrages] against Israel, according to the Israel Defense Forces. \nIran’s foreign minister [said] on Saturday that the country would target all U.S. bases in the region. The country’s semi-official Fars news agency [said] that U.S. bases in Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, and Bahrain were being attacked. Explosions have been reported in Doha, Qatar; Abu Dhabi; and Iraq. Jordan’s military also said it had downed two missiles targeting the country.\nA missile attack struck the U.S. Navy’s Fifth Fleet at Naval Support Activity in Bahrain, [according] to the country’s official communications center. Staffing at the base had been reduced in recent days in case of retaliatory strikes, Fox News had previously reported, citing U.S. officials.\nTrump is expected to address the nation again later on Saturday. He, along with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine, are monitoring the situation from [Mar-a-Lago], the president’s resort in Palm Beach, Florida.\n* United States\n* Iran\n**Jennifer Williams** is a deputy editor at *Foreign Policy*.

Smoke could be seen rising from the capital. It wasn’t immediately clear whether the 86-year-old leader was in his offices at the time of the strike.\n“When we are finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take. This will be probably your only chance for generations,” Trump said in a video announcing “major combat operations” were underway. “For many years, you have asked for America’s help, but you never got it.”\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu echoed that sweeping goal. “Our joint operation will create the conditions for the brave Iranian people to take their fate into their own hands,” Netanyahu said.\nPresident Donald Trump said in a video posted on social media that the U.S. had begun a “massive and ongoing” attack on Iran.\nThe Associated Press\nThe strikes opened a stunning new chapter in U.S. intervention in Iran and marked the second time in eight months that the Trump administration has used military force against the Islamic Republic. They also came just weeks after Trump ordered a military operation to capture Venezuela’s president, Nicolas Maduro, and bring him and his wife to New York to face federal drug conspiracy charges.\nThe operation also comes as tensions have soared in recent weeks as American warships moved into the region, and Trump said he wanted a deal to constrain Iran’s nuclear program at a moment when the country is struggling at home with growing dissent following nationwide protests.\n[Carney backs U.S. air strikes on Iran] \nIran responded as it had been threatening to do for months — first launching a wave of missiles and drones targeting Israel. It followed with strikes targeting U.S. military installations in Bahrain, Kuwait and Qatar. The United Arab Emirates and Iraq shut down their airspace.\nIran’s Foreign Ministry issued a defiant statement, saying that the country “will not hesitate” in its response. In a statement posted on X, the ministry said: “The time has come to defend the homeland and confront the enemy’s military assault.”\nForty people were reported killed at a girls’ school in southern Iran in the Israeli-U.S. strikes, according to Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency. At least 45 others were wounded in the attack in Minab in Iran’s Hormozgan province.\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on reported strike on the school.\nFour people were also killed by an Iranian missile striking a building in Syria’s southern city of Sweida, according to Syrian state television.\nShrapnel from an Iranian missile attack on the capital of the UAE killed one person, state media said.\n## Attack was co-ordinated between Israel and U.S.\nThe attacks came after weeks of the U.S. military massing forces in the region even as U.S. and Iranian envoys held talks in Switzerland and Oman aimed at finding a diplomatic solution to head off American military operation.\nOman’s Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi, a key mediator in the U.S.-Iran nuclear talks, said in a post on X that he was dismayed that U.S. and Israel moved forward with the operation.\n“Active and serious negotiations have yet again been undermined,” said al-Busaidi, who traveled to Washington on Friday to meet with Vice President JD Vance for talks. “Neither the interests of the United States nor the cause of global peace are well served by this. And I pray for the innocents who will suffer. I urge the United States not to get sucked in further.”\nIsrael said the operation was carried out as a “broad, coordinated, and joint operation against the regime” that has been planned for months between the Israeli and U.S. militaries.\n[What the U.S. military buildup against Iran looks like] \nTrump, in justifying the military action, claimed that Iran has continued to develop its nuclear program and plans to develop missiles to reach the U.S.\nHe also acknowledged that there could be American casualties, saying “that often happens in war.”\nIt was a notable call on Americans to brace themselves from a U.S. leader who swept into office on an “America First” platform and vowed to keep out of “forever wars” that had bogged down his recent predecessors.\nTrump’s statement indicated the U.S. was striking for reasons far beyond the nuclear program, listing grievances stretching back to the beginning of the Islamic Republic following a revolution in 1979 that turned Iran from one of America’s closest allies in the Middle East into a fierce foe.\nThe U.S. president said he was aiming to “annihilate” the Iranian navy and destroy regional proxies supported by Tehran.\nHe also called on the Iranian Revolutionary Guard to lay down its arms, pledging that members would be given immunity, while warning they would face “certain death” if they didn’t.\n“They’ve rejected every opportunity to renounce their nuclear ambitions, and we can’t take it anymore,” Trump said.\nTrump had threatened military action — but held off — following Iran’s recent crackdown on protests spurred by economic grievances and evolved into a nationwide, anti-government push against the ruling clerics.\nThe Human Rights Activists News Agency says it confirmed more than 7,000 deaths in the crackdown and that it is investigating thousands more. The government has acknowledged more than 3,000 killed, though it has undercounted or not reported fatalities from past unrest.\nIran has said it hasn’t enriched since June, but it has blocked international inspectors from visiting the sites America bombed during a 12-day war then. Satellite photos analyzed by The Associated Press have shown new activity at two of those sites, suggesting Iran is trying to assess and potentially recover material there.\n[Read U.S. President Donald Trump’s statement on Iran in full] \nIran currently has a self-imposed limit on its ballistic missile program, limiting their range to 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles). That puts all the Mideast and some of Eastern Europe in their range. There is no public evidence of Iran seeking to have intercontinental ballistic missiles, though Washington has criticized its space program as potentially allowing it to one day.\nIran had hoped to avert a war, but maintains it has the right to enrich uranium and does not want to discuss other issues, like its long-range missile program or support for armed groups like Hamas and Hezbollah.\nThe strikes could also have a huge impact on global markets, particularly if Iran is able to make the Strait of Hormuz unsafe for commercial traffic. More than 14 million barrels per day of oil passed through the strait in 2025, about a third of total worldwide oil exports transported by sea.\n[Open this photo in gallery:\n![] \n] \nPeople run for cover following an explosion in Tehran.Majid Asgaripour/Reuters\n## Strikes hit targets across Iran\nIranian media reported strikes nationwide. Roads to Khamenei’s compound in downtown Tehran had been shut down by authorities as other blasts rang out across the capital.\nKhamenei has not made a public appearance in recent days and wasn’t immediately seen after. During the 12-day war in June, he was believed to have been taken to a secure location away from his Tehran compound.\nIn Tehran, witnesses heard the first blast by Khamenei’s office. Iranian state television later reported on the explosion, without offering a cause.\nMore explosions struck Iran’s capital after Israel said it was attacking the country. Authorities have offered no casualty information from the strikes.\nTargets in the Israeli campaign included Iran’s military, symbols of government and intelligence targets, according to an official briefed on the operation, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss nonpublic information on the attack.\n[Open this photo in gallery:\n![] \n] \nResidents evacuate a building hit by a projectile in Haifa, Israel Feb. 28, 2026.

There was no immediate word on any damage or casualties from the ongoing attack.\nMeanwhile, Bahrain said that a missile attack targeted the U.S. Navy’s 5th Fleet headquarters in the island kingdom. Witnesses heard sirens and explosions in Kuwait, home to U.S. Army Central. Explosions could be also be heard in Qatar.\nIraq and the United Arab Emirates closed their airspace, and sirens sounded in Jordan.\nIraqi officials also reported a drone strike hit a headquarters of the Iran-backed Kataib Hezbollah militia in Iraq, killing two people and wounding three Saturday. The group had earlier threatened to enter the fray should Iran come under attack. An Israeli military official said Israel was not aware of any Israeli strikes on Kataib Hezbollah headquarters in Iraq.\nThe Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen, meanwhile, vowed to resume attacks on Red Sea shipping routes and on Israel, according to two senior Houthi officials. They spoke on condition of anonymity because there was no official announcement from the Houthi leadership.\nU.S. embassies or consulates in Qatar, United Arab Emirates and Israel posted on social media that they told staffers to shelter in place and recommended all Americans “do the same until further notice.”\n## Reactions from US lawmakers reflect political divisions\nThe early response from federal lawmakers to the U.S. government’s bombarding of Iran largely revolved around their feelings about Trump.\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who has long pushed for regime change in Iran, called for God to bless Trump. He said on social media that the attacks could provide freedom for the Iranian people, saying, “This operation is necessary and long justified.”\nSen. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., who was a Marine in the Iraq War, warned, “Young working-class kids should not pay the ultimate price for regime change and a war that hasn’t been explained or justified to the American people.”\nRep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., who has emerged as an opponent of Trump, said the president had engaged in “acts of war unauthorized by Congress.”\n[Report an editorial error] \n[Report a technical issue] \n## Related stories\n[\n![Vehicles drive past an anti-Israeli and anti-US billboard that reads in Persian &quot;The target is clear: Trump&#x27;s 51st state&quot; on Palestine Square in Tehran on February 25, 2026.

Trump via Truth Social\nTEL AVIV, Israel — The United States and Israel have launched strikes against Iran with the goal of toppling the regime, President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Saturday.\nIn an [eight-minute video] posted on Truth Social, Trump said the operation, known as \"Epic Fury,\" was \"to prevent this very wicked, radical dictatorship from threatening America and our core national security interests.\"\n*To jump to specific areas of our coverage, use the links below:*\n[Casualties] | [Regional Impact] | [How We Got Here] \n## What we know about casualties on the ground\nA person briefed on the operation told NPR that Israel was targeting Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, though their whereabouts weren't immediately clear.\nSponsor Message\nIran's news agency IRNA said U.S.-Israeli strikes hit a girls' school, killing dozens of young students and wounding more.\nIran's Foreign Ministry called the airstrikes a \"gross violation\" of its national sovereignty, and retaliated by launching missiles at Israel and at military bases with U.S. troops in Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. An Iranian official said all Israeli and U.S. interests in the region were now considered legitimate targets.\nThe UAE Defense Ministry said an Asian migrant worker was killed from fallen debris when air defenses intercepted missiles attacking a base with U.S. troops in Abu Dhabi.\n## How we got here\nThe joint U.S.-Israeli attack on Iran comes after weeks of escalating tensions and a major U.S. military buildup in the region, as the U.S. and Iran tried to negotiate a deal to limit Iran's nuclear program. Trump said those efforts had failed.\n\"Bombs will be dropping everywhere,\" President Trump said in his video address. \"When we are finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take. This will be, probably, your only chance for generations.\"\nThe Israeli military said in a statement its fighter jets were striking \"dozens of military targets\" in Iran with \"full synchronization and coordination\" between the Israeli and U.S. militaries following months of joint planning.\nSponsor Message\nPrime Minister Netanyahu said the goal of the joint U.S.-Israeli attack is to \"remove the existential threat posed by the terrorist regime in Iran.\"\n\"Our joint action will create the conditions for the brave Iranian people to take their destiny into their own hands,\" Netanyahu said in a video.\nA person briefed on the operation told NPR it was expected to last a few days, with Israel's military focusing on targeting Iran's missile program.\n\"We are going to destroy their missiles and raze their missile industry to the ground,\" Trump said.\n## Ramifications across the Middle East\nIsrael has closed its airspace to all passenger flights, and civil defense protocols have been activated. Regional military forces remain on high alert.\nIsrael declared a 48-hour state of emergency. Air raid sirens have been sounding across the country, with authorities warning civilians to enter bomb shelters.\nTrails of smoke streaked the sky above Tel Aviv as Israeli interception systems fired at incoming missiles. A hospital in central Israel began moving operations to an underground fortified compound.\n\"Our objective is to defend the American people by eliminating imminent threats from the Iranian regime, a vicious group of very hard, terrible people.

The barrier entirely encircles the city, which is home to more than 55,000 Palestinians. ©2018 AFP/Getty Images\n# Summary\nAbout 6.8 million Jewish Israelis and 6.8 million Palestinians live today between the Mediterranean Sea and Jordan River, an area encompassing Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT), the latter made up of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip. Throughout most of this area, Israel is the sole governing power; in the remainder, it exercises primary authority alongside limited Palestinian self-rule. Across these areas and in most aspects of life, Israeli authorities methodically privilege Jewish Israelis and discriminate against Palestinians. Laws, policies, and statements by leading Israeli officials make plain that the objective of maintaining Jewish Israeli control over demographics, political power, and land has long guided government policy. In pursuit of this goal, authorities have dispossessed, confined, forcibly separated, and subjugated Palestinians by virtue of their identity to varying degrees of intensity. In certain areas, as described in this report, these deprivations are so severe that they amount to the crimes against humanity of apartheid and persecution.\n![Map of Israel and Occupied Palestinian Territories] \nPlay Video\nSeveral widely held assumptions, including that the occupation is temporary, that the “peace process” will soon bring an end to Israeli abuses, that Palestinians have meaningful control over their lives in the West Bank and Gaza, and that Israel is an egalitarian democracy inside its borders, have obscured the reality of Israel’s entrenched discriminatory rule over Palestinians. Israel has maintained military rule over some portion of the Palestinian population for all but six months of its 73-year history. It did so over the vast majority of Palestinians inside Israel from 1948 and until 1966. From 1967 until the present, it has militarily ruled over Palestinians in the OPT, excluding East Jerusalem. By contrast, it has since its founding governed all Jewish Israelis, including settlers in the OPT since the beginning of the occupation in 1967, under its more rights-respecting civil law.\n[![Overview map of Israel and Palestine] \nClick to expand Image\n] \nIsrael and the Israeli-occupied Palestinian Territory, made up of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip, as well as the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights© 2021 Human Rights Watch\nFor the past 54 years, Israeli authorities have facilitated the transfer of Jewish Israelis to the OPT and granted them a superior status under the law as compared to Palestinians living in the same territory when it comes to civil rights, access to land, and freedom to move, build, and confer residency rights to close relatives. While Palestinians have a limited degree of self-rule in parts of the OPT, Israel retains primary control over borders, airspace, the movement of people and goods, security, and the registry of the entire population, which in turn dictates such matters as legal status and eligibility to receive identity cards.\nA number of Israeli officials have stated clearly their intent to maintain this control in perpetuity and backed it up through their actions, including continued settlement expansion over the course of the decades-long “peace process.” Unilateral annexation of additional parts of the West Bank, which the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to carry out, would formalize the reality of systematic Israeli domination and oppression that has long prevailed without changing the reality that the entire West Bank is occupied territory under the international law of occupation, including East Jerusalem, which Israel unilaterally annexed in 1967.\nInternational criminal law has developed two crimes against humanity for situations of systematic discrimination and repression: apartheid and persecution. Crimes against humanity stand among the most odious crimes in international law.\nThe international community has over the years detached the term apartheid from its original South African context, developed a universal legal prohibition against its practice, and recognized it as a crime against humanity with definitions provided in the 1973 International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid (“Apartheid Convention”) and the 1998 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC).\nThe crime against humanity of persecution, also set out in the Rome Statute, the intentional and severe deprivation of fundamental rights on racial, ethnic, and other grounds, grew out of the post-World War II trials and constitutes one of the most serious international crimes, of the same gravity as apartheid.\nThe State of Palestine is a state party to both the Rome Statute and the Apartheid Convention. In February 2021, the ICC ruled that it has jurisdiction over serious international crimes committed in the entirety of the OPT, including East Jerusalem, which would include the crimes against humanity of apartheid or persecution committed in that territory. In March 2021, the ICC Office of Prosecutor announced the opening of a formal investigation into the situation in Palestine.\nThe term apartheid has increasingly been used in relation to Israel and the OPT, but usually in a descriptive or comparative, non-legal sense, and often to warn that the situation is heading in the wrong direction. In particular, Israeli, Palestinian, US, and European officials, prominent media commentators, and others have asserted that, if Israel’s policies and practices towards Palestinians continued along the same trajectory, the situation, at least in the West Bank, would become tantamount to apartheid.[[1]] Some have claimed that the current reality amounts to apartheid.[[2]] Few, however, have conducted a detailed legal analysis based on the international crimes of apartheid or persecution.[[3]] \nIn this report, Human Rights Watch examines the extent to which that threshold has already been crossed in certain of the areas where Israeli authorities exercise control.\n## Definitions of Apartheid and Persecution\nThe prohibition of institutionalized discrimination, especially on grounds of race or ethnicity, constitutes one of the fundamental elements of international law. Most states have agreed to treat the worst forms of such discrimination, that is, persecution and apartheid, as crimes against humanity, and have given the ICC the power to prosecute these crimes when national authorities are unable or unwilling to pursue them. Crimes against humanity consist of specific criminal acts committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack, or acts committed pursuant to a state or organizational policy, directed against a civilian population.\nThe Apartheid Convention defines the crime against humanity of apartheid as “inhuman acts committed for the purpose of establishing and maintaining domination by one racial group of persons over any other racial group of persons and systematically oppressing them.” The Rome Statute of the ICC adopts a similar definition: “inhumane acts… committed in the context of an institutionalized regime of systematic oppression and domination by one racial group over any other racial group or groups and committed with the intention of maintaining that regime.” The Rome Statute does not further define what constitutes an “institutionalized regime.”\nThe crime of apartheid under the Apartheid Convention and Rome Statute consists of three primary elements: an intent to maintain a system of domination by one racial group over another; systematic oppression by one racial group over another; and one or more*inhumane acts*, as defined, carried out on a widespread or systematic basis pursuant to those policies.\nAmong the inhumane acts identified in either the Convention or the Rome Statute are “forcible transfer,” “expropriation of landed property,” “creation of separate reserves and ghettos,” and denial of the “the right to leave and to return to their country, [and] the right to a nationality.”\nThe Rome Statute identifies the crime against humanity of persecution as “the intentional and severe deprivation of fundamental rights contrary to international law by reason of the identity of the group or collectivity,” including on racial, national, or ethnic grounds. Customary international law identifies the crime of persecution as consisting of two primary elements: (1) severe abuses of fundamental rights committed on a widespread or systematic basis, and (2) with discriminatory intent.\nFew courts have heard cases involving the crime of persecution and none the crime of apartheid, resulting in a lack of case law around the meanings of key terms in their definitions. As described in the report, international criminal courts have over the last two decades evaluated group identity based on the context and construction by local actors, as opposed to earlier approaches focused on hereditary physical traits. In international human rights law, including the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD), race and racial discrimination have been broadly interpreted to include distinctions based on descent, and national or ethnic origin, among other categories.\n## Application to Israel’s Policies towards Palestinians\nTwo primary groups live today in Israel and the OPT: Jewish Israelis and Palestinians. One primary sovereign, the Israeli government, rules over them.\n### Intent to Maintain Domination\nA stated aim of the Israeli government is to ensure that Jewish Israelis maintain domination across Israel and the OPT. The Knesset in 2018 passed a law with constitutional status affirming Israel as the “nation-state of the Jewish people,” declaring that within that territory, the right to self-determination “is unique to the Jewish people,” and establishing “Jewish settlement” as a national value. To sustain Jewish Israeli control, Israeli authorities have adopted policies aimed at mitigating what they have openly described as a demographic “threat” that Palestinians pose. Those policies include limiting the population and political power of Palestinians, granting the right to vote only to Palestinians who live within the borders of Israel as they existed from 1948 to June 1967, and limiting the ability of Palestinians to move to Israel from the OPT and from anywhere else to Israel or the OPT. Other steps are taken to ensure Jewish domination, including a state policy of “separation” of Palestinians between the West Bank and Gaza, which prevents the movement of people and goods within the OPT, and “Judaization” of areas with significant Palestinian populations, including Jerusalem as well as the Galilee and the Negev in Israel. This policy, which aims to maximize Jewish Israeli control over land, concentrates the majority of Palestinians who live outside Israel’s major, predominantly Jewish cities into dense, under-served enclaves and restricts their access to land and housing, while nurturing the growth of nearby Jewish communities.\n### Systematic Oppression and Institutional Discrimination\nTo implement the goal of domination, the Israeli government institutionally discriminates against Palestinians. The intensity of that discrimination varies according to different rules established by the Israeli government in Israel, on the one hand, and different parts of the OPT, on the other, where the most severe form takes place.\nIn the OPT, which Israel has recognized as a single territory encompassing the West Bank and Gaza, Israeli authorities treat Palestinians separately and unequally as compared to Jewish Israeli settlers. In the occupied West Bank, Israel subjects Palestinians to draconian military law and enforces segregation, largely prohibiting Palestinians from entering settlements. In the besieged Gaza Strip, Israel imposes a generalized closure, sharply restricting the movement of people and goods—policies that Gaza’s other neighbor, Egypt, often does little to alleviate. In annexed East Jerusalem, which Israel considers part of its sovereign territory but remains occupied territory under international law, Israel provides the vast majority of the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians living there with a legal status that weakens their residency rights by conditioning them on the individual’s connections to the city, among other factors. This level of discrimination amounts to systematic oppression.\nIn Israel, which the vast majority of nations consider being the area defined by its pre-1967 borders, the two tiered-citizenship structure and bifurcation of nationality and citizenship result in Palestinian citizens having a status inferior to Jewish citizens by law. While Palestinians in Israel, unlike those in the OPT, have the right to vote and stand for Israeli elections, these rights do not empower them to overcome the institutional discrimination they face from the same Israeli government, including widespread restrictions on accessing land confiscated from them, home demolitions, and effective prohibitions on family reunification.\nThe fragmentation of the Palestinian population, in part deliberately engineered through Israeli restrictions on movement and residency, furthers the goal of domination and helps obscure the reality of the same Israeli government repressing the same Palestinian population group, to varying degrees in different areas, for the benefit of the same Jewish Israeli dominant group.\n### Inhumane Acts and Other Abuses of Fundamental Rights\nPursuant to these policies, Israeli authorities have carried out a range of inhumane acts in the OPT. Those include sweeping restrictions on the movement of 4.7 million Palestinians there; the confiscation of much of their land; the imposition of harsh conditions, including categorical denial of building permits in large parts of the West Bank, which has led thousands of Palestinians to leave their homes under conditions that amount to forcible transfer; the denial of residency rights to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians and their relatives, largely for being abroad when the occupation began in 1967, or for long periods during the first few decades of the occupation, or as a result of the effective freeze on family reunification over the last two decades; and the suspension of basic civil rights, such as freedom of assembly and association, depriving Palestinians of the opportunity to have a voice in a wide range of affairs that most affect their daily lives and futures. Many of these abuses, including categorical denials of building permits, mass residency revocations or restrictions, and large-scale land confiscations, have no legitimate security justifications; others, such as the extent of restrictions on movement and civil rights, fail any reasonable balancing test between security concerns and the severity of the underlying rights abuse.\nSince the founding of the state of Israel, the government also has systematically discriminated against and violated the rights of Palestinians inside the state’s pre-1967 borders, including by refusing to allow Palestinians access to the millions of dunams of land (1000 dunams equals 100 hectares, about 250 acres or 1 square kilometer) that were confiscated from them. In one region—the Negev—these policies make it virtually impossible for tens of thousands of Palestinians to live lawfully in the communities they have lived in for decades. In addition, Israeli authorities refuse to permit the more than 700,000 Palestinians who fled or were expelled in 1948, and their descendants, to return to Israel or the OPT, and impose blanket restrictions on legal residency, which block many Palestinian spouses and families from living together in Israel.\n## Report Findings\nThis report examines Israeli policies and practices towards Palestinians in the OPT and Israel and compares them to the treatment of Jewish Israelis living in the same territories. It is not an exhaustive evaluation of all types of international human rights and humanitarian law violations. Rather, it surveys consequential Israeli government practices and policies that violate the basic rights of Palestinians and whose purpose is to ensure the domination of Jewish Israelis, and assesses them against the definitions of the crimes against humanity of apartheid and persecution.\nThe report draws on years of research and documentation by Human Rights Watch and other rights organizations, including fieldwork conducted for this report. Human Rights Watch also reviewed Israeli laws, government planning documents, statements by officials, and land records. This evidentiary record was then analyzed under the legal standards for the crimes of apartheid and persecution. Human Rights Watch also wrote in July 2020 to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, soliciting the government’s perspectives on the issues covered, but, as of publication, had not received a response.\nThe report does not set out to compare Israel with South Africa under apartheid or to determine whether Israel is an “apartheid state”—a concept that is not defined in international law. Rather, the report assesses whether specific acts and policies carried out by Israeli authorities today amount in particular areas to the crimes of apartheid and persecution as defined under international law.\nEach of the report’s three main substantive chapters explores Israel’s rule over Palestinians: the dynamics of its rule and discrimination, looking in turn at Israel and the OPT, the particular rights abuses that it commits there, and some of the objectives that motivate these policies. It does so in terms of the primary elements of the crimes of apartheid and persecution, as outlined above. Human Rights Watch evaluates the dynamics of Israeli rule in each of these areas, keeping in mind the different legal frameworks that apply in the OPT and Israel, which are the two legally recognized territorial entities, each with a different status under international law. While noting significant factual differences among subregions in each of these two territories, the report does not make separate subregional determinations.\nOn the basis of its research, Human Rights Watch concludes that the Israeli government has demonstrated an intent to maintain the domination of Jewish Israelis over Palestinians across Israel and the OPT. In the OPT, including East Jerusalem, that intent has been coupled with systematic oppression of Palestinians and inhumane acts committed against them. When these three elements occur together, they amount to the crime of apartheid.\nIsraeli officials have also committed the crime against humanity of persecution. This finding is based on the discriminatory intent behind Israel’s treatment of Palestinians and the grave abuses carried out in the OPT that include the widespread confiscation of privately owned land, the effective prohibition on building or living in many areas, the mass denial of residency rights, and sweeping, decades-long restrictions on the freedom of movement and basic civil rights. Such policies and practices intentionally and severely deprive millions of Palestinians of key fundamental rights, including to residency, private property, and access to land, services, and resources, on a widespread and systematic basis by virtue of their identity as Palestinians.\n## Seeking Maximal Land with Minimal Palestinians\nIsraeli policy has sought to engineer and maximize the number of Jews, as well as the land available to them, in Israel and the portions of the OPT coveted by the Israeli government for Jewish settlement. At the same time, by restricting the residency rights of Palestinians, Israeli policy seeks to minimize the number of Palestinians and the land available to them in those areas. The level of repression is most severe in the OPT, although often less severe aspects of similar policies can be found within Israel.\n[![202104mena_israelpalestine_separatingpalestinians] \nClick to expand Image\n] \nIn the West Bank, authorities have confiscated more than 2 million dunams of land from Palestinians, making up more than one-third of the West Bank, including tens of thousands of dunams that they acknowledge are privately owned by Palestinians. One common tactic they have used is to declare territory, including privately-owned Palestinian land, as “state land.” The Israeli group Peace Now estimates that the Israeli government has designated about 1.4 million dunams of land, or about a quarter of the West Bank, as state land. The group has also found that more than 30 percent of the land used for settlements is acknowledged by the Israeli government as having been privately owned by Palestinians. Of the more than 675,000 dunams of state land that Israeli authorities have allocated for use by third parties in the West Bank, they have earmarked more than 99 percent for use by Israeli civilians, according to government data. Land grabs for settlements and the infrastructure that primarily serves settlers effectively concentrate Palestinians in the West Bank, according to B’Tselem, into “165 non-contiguous ‘territorial islands.’”\nIsraeli authorities have also made it virtually impossible in practice for Palestinians in Area C, the roughly 60 percent of the West Bank that the Oslo Accords placed under full Israeli control, as well as those in East Jerusalem, to obtain building permits. In Area C, for example, authorities approved less than 1.5 percent of applications by Palestinians to build between 2016 and 2018—21 in total—a figure 100 times smaller than the number of demolition orders it issued in the same period, according to official data. Israeli authorities have razed thousands of Palestinian properties in these areas for lacking a permit, leaving thousands of families displaced. By contrast, according to Peace Now, Israeli authorities began construction on more than 23,696housing units between 2009 and 2020in Israeli settlements in Area C. Transfer of an occupying power’s civilian population to an occupied territory violates the Fourth Geneva Convention.\nThese policies grow out of longstanding Israeli government plans. For example, the 1980 Drobles Plan, which guided the government’s settlement policy in the West Bank at the time and built on prior plans, called for authorities to “settle the land between the [Arab] minority population centers and their surroundings,” noting that doing so would make it “hard for Palestinians to create territorial contiguity and political unity” and “remove any trace of doubt about our intention to control Judea and Samaria forever.”\nIn Jerusalem, the government’s plan for the municipality, including both the west and occupied east of the city, sets the goal of “maintaining a solid Jewish majority in the city” and a target demographic “ratio of 70% Jews and 30% Arabs”—later adjusted to a 60:40 ratio after authorities acknowledged that “this goal is not attainable” in light of “the demographic trend.”\nThe Israeli government has also carried out discriminatory seizures of land inside Israel. Authorities have seized through different mechanisms at least 4.5 million dunams of land from Palestinians, according to historians, constituting 65 to 75 percent of all land owned by Palestinians before 1948 and 40 to 60 percent of the land that belonged to Palestinians who remained after 1948 and became citizens of Israel. Authorities in the early years of the state declared land belonging to displaced Palestinians as “absentee property” or “closed military zones,” then took it over, converted it to state land, and built Jewish communities there. Authorities continue to block Palestinian citizen landowners from accessing land that was confiscated from them. A 2003 government-commissioned report found that “the expropriation activities were clearly and explicitly harnessed to the interests of the Jewish majority” and that state lands, which constitute 93 percent of all land in Israel, effectively serve the objective of “Jewish settlement.” Since 1948, the government has authorized the creation of more than 900 “Jewish localities” in Israel, but it has allowed only a handful of government-planned townships and villages for Palestinians, created largely to concentrate previously displaced Bedouin communities living in the Negev.\nLand confiscations and other discriminatory land policies in Israel hem in Palestinian municipalities inside Israel, denying them opportunities for natural expansion enjoyed by Jewish municipalities. The vast majority of Palestinian citizens, who make up around 19 percent of the Israeli population, live in these municipalities, which have an estimated jurisdiction over less than 3 percent of all land in Israel. While Palestinians in Israel can move freely, and some live in “mixed cities,” such as Haifa, Tel Aviv-Jaffa, and Acre, Israeli law permits small towns to exclude prospective residents based on their asserted incompatibility with the town’s “social-cultural fabric.” According to a study by a professor at Technion-Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa, there are more than 900 small Jewish towns, including*kibbutzim*, across Israel that can restrict who lives there. None of them have any Palestinians living among them.\nIn the Negev in Israel, Israeli authorities have refused to legally recognize 35 Palestinian Bedouin communities, making it impossible for their 90,000 or so residents to live lawfully in the communities they have lived in for decades. Instead, authorities have sought to concentrate Bedouin communities in larger recognized townships in order, as expressed in governmental plans and statements by officials, to maximize the land available for Jewish communities. Israeli law considers all buildings in these unrecognized villages to be illegal, and authorities have refused to connect most to the national electricity or water grids or to provide even basic infrastructure such as paved roads or sewage systems. The communities do not appear on official maps, most have no educational facilities, and residents live under constant threat of having their homes demolished. Israeli authorities demolished more than 10,000 Bedouin homes in the Negev between 2013 and 2019, according to government data. They razed one unrecognized village that challenged the expropriation of its lands, al-Araqib, 185 times.\nAuthorities have implemented these policies pursuant to government plans since the early years of the state that called for restricting Bedouin communities in order to secure land suitable for settling Jews. Several months before becoming prime minister in December 2000, Ariel Sharon declared that Bedouins in the Negev “are gnawing at the country’s land reserves,” which he described as “a demographic phenomenon.” As prime minister, Sharon went on to pursue a multi-billion-dollar plan that transparently sought to boost the Jewish population in the Negev and Galilee regions of Israel, areas that have significant Palestinian populations. His deputy prime minister, Shimon Peres, later described the plan as a “battle for the future for the Jewish people.”\nSharon’s push to Judaize the Negev, as well as the Galilee, developed against the backdrop of the government’s decision to withdraw Jewish settlers from Gaza. After ending Jewish settlement there, Israel began to treat Gaza effectively as a territorial jurisdiction whose population it could consider as outside the demographic calculus of Jews and Palestinians who live in Israel and in the vast majority of the OPT—the West Bank including East Jerusalem—that Israel intends to retain. Israeli officials at the time acknowledged the demographic objectives behind the move. Amid the push to withdraw settlers from Gaza, Sharon said in an August 2005 address to Israelis, “Gaza cannot be held onto forever. Over one million Palestinians live there and they double their numbers with every generation.” Peres said the same month, “We are disengaging from Gaza because of demography.”\nDespite withdrawing its settlers and ground troops, Israel has remained in critical ways the supreme power in Gaza, dominating through other means and hence maintaining its legal obligations as an occupying power, as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the United Nations (UN), among others, have determined. Most significantly, Israel bans Palestinians living there (with only narrow exceptions) from leaving through the Erez Passenger Crossing it controls and instituted a formal “policy of separation” between Gaza and the West Bank, despite Israel having recognized within the framework of the Oslo Accords these two parts of the OPT as collectively forming a “single territorial unit.” The generalized travel ban, which has remained in place since 2007 and reduced travel out of Gaza to a fraction of what it was two decades ago, is not based on an individualized security assessment and fails any reasonable test of balancing security concerns against the right to freedom of movement for over two million people.\nAuthorities have also sharply restricted the entry and exit of goods to and from Gaza, which, alongside Egypt often shutting its border, effectively seals it off from the outside world. These restrictions have contributed to limiting access to basic services, devastating the economy, and making 80 percent of the population reliant on humanitarian aid. Families in Gaza in recent years have had to make do without centrally provided electricity for between 12 and 20 hours per day, depending on the period. Water is also critically scarce; the UN considers more than 96 percent of the water supply in Gaza “unfit for human consumption.”\nWithin the West Bank as well, Israeli authorities prohibit Palestinian ID holders from entering areas such as East Jerusalem, lands beyond the separation barrier, and areas controlled by settlements and the army, unless they secure difficult-to-obtain permits. They have also erected nearly 600 permanent obstacles, many between Palestinian communities, that disrupt daily life for Palestinians. In sharp contrast, Israeli authorities allow Jewish settlers in the West Bank to move freely within the majority of the West Bank under its exclusive control, as well as to and from Israel, on roads built to facilitate their commutes and integrate them into every facet of Israeli life.\nDemographic considerations factor centrally in Israel’s separation policy between Gaza and the West Bank. In particular, in the rare cases when they allow movement between the two parts of the OPT, Israeli authorities permit it predominantly in the direction of Gaza, thereby facilitating population flow away from the area where Israel actively promotes Jewish settlement. The Israeli army’s official policy states that while a West Bank resident can apply “for permanent resettlement in the Gaza Strip for any purpose that is considered humanitarian (usually family reunification),” Gaza residents can settle in the West Bank only “in the rarest cases,” usually related to family reunification. In these cases, authorities are mandated to aim to resettle the couple in Gaza. Official data shows that Israel did not approve a single Gaza resident to resettle in the West Bank, outside of a handful who filed Supreme Court petitions between 2009 and March 2017, while permitting several dozen West Bank residents to relocate to Gaza on the condition that they sign a pledge not to return to the West Bank.\nBeyond the closure policy, Israeli authorities have often used oppressive and indiscriminate means during hostilities and protests in Gaza. Since 2008, the Israeli army has launched three large-scale military offensives in Gaza in the context of hostilities with armed Palestinian groups. As described in the report, those offensives have included apparently deliberate attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure and killed well over 2,000 civilians. In addition, Israeli forces have regularly fired on Palestinian demonstrators and others who have approached fences separating Gaza and Israel in circumstances when they did not pose an imminent threat to life, killing 214 demonstrators in 2018 and 2019 alone and maiming thousands. These practices stem from a decades-long pattern of using excessive and vastly disproportionate force to quell protests and disturbances, at great cost to civilians. Despite the frequency of such incidents over the years, Israeli authorities have failed to develop law enforcement tactics that comport with international human rights norms.\n## Discriminatory Restrictions on Residency and Nationality\nPalestinians face discriminatory restrictions on their rights to residency and nationality to varying degrees in the OPT and Israel. Israeli authorities have used their control over the population registry in the West Bank and Gaza—the list of Palestinians they consider lawful residents for purposes of issuing legal status and identity cards—to deny residency to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians. Israeli authorities refused to register at least 270,000 Palestinians who were outside the West Bank and Gaza when the occupation began in 1967 and revoked the residency of nearly 250,000, mostly for being abroad for too long between 1967 and 1994. Since 2000, Israeli authorities have largely refused to process family reunification applications or requests for address changes by Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. The freeze effectively bars Palestinians from acquiring legal status for spouses or relatives not already registered and makes illegal, according to the Israeli army, the presence in the West Bank of thousands of Gaza residents who arrived on temporary permits and now live there, since they effectively cannot change their address to one in the West Bank. These restrictions have the effect of limiting the Palestinian population in the West Bank.\nAuthorities regularly deny entry into the West Bank to non-registered Palestinians who had lived in the West Bank but left temporarily (to study, work, marry, or for other reasons) and to their non-registered spouses and other family members.\nWhen Israel annexed East Jerusalem in 1967, it applied its 1952 Law of Entry to Palestinians who lived there and designated them as “permanent residents,” the same status afforded to a non-Jewish foreigner who moves to Israel. The Interior Ministry has revoked this status from at least 14,701 Palestinians since 1967, mostly for failing to prove a “center of life” in the city. A path to Israeli citizenship exists, but few apply and most who did in recent years were not granted citizenship. By contrast, Jewish Israelis in Jerusalem, including settlers in East Jerusalem, are citizens who do not have to prove connections to the city to maintain their status.\nInside Israel, Israel’s Proclamation of Independence affirms the “complete equality” of all residents, but a two-track citizenship structure contradicts that vow and effectively regards Jews and Palestinians separately and unequally. Israel’s 1952 Citizenship Law contains a separate track exclusively for Jews to obtain automatic citizenship. That law grows out of the 1950 Law of Return which guarantees Jewish citizens of other countries the right to settle in Israel. By contrast, the track for Palestinians conditions citizenship on proving residency before 1948 in the territory that became Israel, inclusion in the population registry as of 1952, and a continuous presence in Israel or legal entry in the period between 1948 and 1952. Authorities have used this language to deny residency rights to the more than 700,000 Palestinians who fled or were expelled in 1948 and their descendants, who today number more than 5.7 million. This law creates a reality where a Jewish citizen of any other country who has never been to Israel can move there and automatically gain citizenship, while a Palestinian expelled from his home and languishing for more than 70 years in a refugee camp in a nearby country, cannot.\nThe 1952 Citizenship Law also authorizes granting citizenship based on naturalization. However, in 2003, the Knesset passed the Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law (Temporary Order), which bars granting Israeli citizenship or long-term legal status to Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza who marry Israeli citizens or residents. With few exceptions, this law, renewed every year since and upheld by the Israeli Supreme Court, denies both Jewish and Palestinian citizens and residents of Israel who choose to marry Palestinians the right to live with their partner in Israel. This restriction, based solely on the spouse’s identity as a Palestinian from the West Bank or Gaza, notably does not apply when Israelis marry non-Jewish spouses of most other foreign nationalities. They can receive immediate status and, after several years, apply for citizenship.\nCommenting on a 2005 renewal of the law, the prime minister at the time, Ariel Sharon, said: “There’s no need to hide behind security arguments. There’s a need for the existence of a Jewish state.” Benjamin Netanyahu, who was then the finance minister, said during discussions at the time: “Instead of making it easier for Palestinians who want to get citizenship, we should make the process much more difficult, in order to guarantee Israel’s security and a Jewish majority in Israel.” In March 2019, this time as prime minister, Netanyahu declared, “Israel is not a state of all its citizens,” but rather “the nation-state of the Jewish people and only them.”\nInternational human rights law gives broad latitude to governments in setting their immigration policies. There is nothing in international law to bar Israel from promoting Jewish immigration. Jewish Israelis, many of whom historically migrated to Mandatory Palestine or later to Israel to escape anti-Semitic persecution in different parts of the world, are entitled to protection of their safety and fundamental rights. However, that latitude does not give a state the prerogative to discriminate against people who already live in that country, including with respect to rights concerning family reunification, and against people who have a right to return to the country. Palestinians are also entitled to protection of their safety and fundamental rights.\n## Israeli Justifications of Policies and Practices\nIsraeli authorities justify many of the policies documented in this report as responses to Palestinian anti-Israeli violence. Many policies, though, like the denial of building permits in Area C, East Jerusalem, and the Negev in Israel, residency revocations for Jerusalemites, or expropriation of privately owned land and discriminatory allocation of state lands, have no legitimate security justification. Others, including the Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law and freeze of the OPT population registry, use security as a pretext to advance demographic objectives.\nIsraeli authorities do face legitimate security challenges in Israel and the OPT. However, restrictions that do not seek to balance human rights such as freedom of movement against legitimate security concerns by, for example, conducting individualized security assessments rather than barring the entire population of Gaza from leaving with only rare exceptions, go far beyond what international law permits. Even where security forms part of the motivation behind a particular policy, that does not give Israel a carte blanche to violate human rights en masse. Legitimate security concerns can be present among policies that amount to apartheid, just as they can be present in a policy that sanctions the use of excessive force or torture.\nOfficials sometimes claim that measures taken in the OPT are temporary and would be rescinded in the context of a peace agreement. From former Prime Minister Levi Eshkol, of the Labor Party, declaring in July 1967 that “I see only a quasi-independent region [for Palestinians], because the security and land are in Israeli hands,” to Netanyahu of the Likud in July 2019 stating that “Israeli military and security forces will continue to rule the entire territory, up to the Jordan [River],” a range of officials have made clear their intent to maintain overriding control over the West Bank in perpetuity, regardless of what arrangements are in place to govern Palestinians. Their actions and policies further dispel the notion that Israeli authorities consider the occupation temporary, including the continuing of land confiscation, the building of the separation barrier in a way that accommodated anticipated growth of settlements, the seamless integration of the settlements’ sewage system, communication networks, electrical grids, water infrastructure and a matrix of roads with Israel proper, as well as a growing body of laws applicable to West Bank Israeli settlers but not Palestinians. The possibility that a future Israeli leader might forge a deal with Palestinians that dismantles the discriminatory system and ends systematic repression does not negate the intent of current officials to maintain the current system, nor the current reality of apartheid and persecution.\n## Recommendations\nThe Israeli government should dismantle all forms of systematic domination and oppression that privilege Jewish Israelis and systematically repress Palestinians, and end the persecution of Palestinians. In particular, authorities should end discriminatory policies and practices with regards to citizenship and residency rights, civil rights, freedom of movement, allocation of land and resources, access to water, electricity, and other services, and granting of building permits.\nThe findings that the crimes of apartheid and persecution are being committed do not deny the reality of Israeli occupation or erase Israel’s obligations under the law of occupation, any more than would a finding that other crimes against humanity or war crimes have been carried out. As such, Israeli authorities should cease building settlements and dismantle existing ones and otherwise provide Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza with full respect of their human rights, using as a benchmark the rights that it grants Israeli citizens, as well as the protections that international humanitarian law grants them.\nThe Palestinian Authority (PA) should end forms of security coordination with the Israeli army that contribute to facilitating the crimes against humanity of apartheid and persecution.\nThe finding of crimes against humanity should prompt the international community to reevaluate its approach to Israel and Palestine. The US, which for decades has largely failed to press the Israeli government to end its systematic repression of Palestinians, has in some instances in recent years signaled its support for serious abuses such as the building of settlements in the occupied West Bank. Many European and other states have built close ties with Israel, while supporting the “peace process,” building the capacity of the PA, and distancing themselves from and sometimes criticizing specific abusive Israeli practices in the OPT. This approach, which overlooks the deeply entrenched nature of Israeli discrimination and repression of Palestinians there, minimizes serious human rights abuses by treating them as temporary symptoms of the occupation that the “peace process” will soon cure. It has enabled states to resist the sort of accountability that a situation of this gravity warrants, allowing apartheid to metastasize and consolidate. After 54 years, states should stop assessing the situation through the prism of what might happen should the languishing peace process one day be revived and focus instead on the longstanding reality on the ground that shows no signs of abating.\nCrimes against humanity can serve as the basis for individual criminal liability in international fora, as well as in domestic courts outside of Israel and the OPT under the principle of universal jurisdiction.\nIn light of the decades-long failure by Israeli authorities to rein in serious abuses, the International Criminal Court’s Office of the Prosecutor should investigate and prosecute individuals credibly implicated in the crimes against humanity of apartheid or persecution.The ICC has jurisdiction over, and the prosecutor has opened an investigation into, serious crimes committed in the OPT. In addition, all governments should investigate and prosecute those credibly implicated in these crimes, under the principle of universal jurisdiction and in accordance with national laws.\nBeyond criminality, Human Rights Watch calls on states to establish through the UN an international commission of inquiry to investigate systematic discrimination and repression based on group identity in the OPT and Israel. The inquiry should be mandated to establish and analyze the facts; identify those responsible for serious crimes, including apartheid and persecution, with a view to ensuring that the perpetrators are held accountable; as well as collect and preserve evidence related to abuses for future use by credible judicial institutions.\nStates should also establish through the UN a position of UN global envoy for the crimes of persecution and apartheid with a mandate to mobilize international action to end persecution and apartheid worldwide.\nStates should issue statements expressing concern about Israel’s practice of apartheid and persecution. They should vet agreements, cooperation schemes, and all forms of trade and dealing with Israel to screen for those directly contributing to the commission of the crimes of apartheid and persecution against Palestinians, mitigate the human rights impacts, and, where not possible, end the activities and funding found to facilitate these serious crimes.\nThe implications of the findings of this report for businesses are complex and beyond the scope of this report. At a minimum, businesses should cease activities that directly contribute to the commission of the crimes of apartheid and persecution. Companies should assess whether their goods or services contribute to the commission of the crimes of apartheid and persecution, such as equipment used in the unlawful demolition of Palestinian homes, and cease providing goods and services that will likely be used for such purposes, in accordance with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.\nStates should impose individual sanctions, including travel bans and asset freezes, against officials and individuals responsible for the continued commission of these serious crimes and condition arms sales and military and security assistance to Israel on Israeli authorities taking concrete and verifiable steps towards ending their commission of the crimes of apartheid and persecution.\nThe international community has for too long explained away and turned a blind eye to the increasingly transparent reality on the ground. Every day a person is born in Gaza into an open-air prison, in the West Bank without civil rights, in Israel with an inferior status by law, and in neighboring countries effectively condemned to lifelong refugee status, like their parents and grandparents before them, solely because they are Palestinian and not Jewish. A future rooted in the freedom, equality, and dignity of all people living in Israel and the OPT will remain elusive so long as Israel’s abusive practices against Palestinians persist.\n# Methodology\nThis report focuses on Israel’s treatment of Palestinians in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT) and in Israel. It is not a comprehensive examination of all repressive policies, practices, and other facets of institutional discrimination. It also does not account for all human rights abuses in these areas, including rights abuses committed by Palestinian authorities or armed groups, which Human Rights Watch has covered extensively elsewhere.[[4]] Rather, it examines discriminatory policies, laws, and regulations that privilege Jewish Israelis to the detriment of Palestinians.\nWhile the report evaluates whether specific Israeli policies and practices amount to the crimes against humanity of apartheid and persecution, it does not delve into the potential criminal liability of particular Israeli officials.\nThis report is based primarily on years of documentation carried out by Human Rights Watch, as well as by Israeli, Palestinian, and international human rights groups. Human Rights Watch also reviewed Israeli laws, government planning documents, statements by officials, land records, and legal standards governing the crimes of apartheid and persecution. The report includes several case studies, based on 40 interviews with affected persons, current and former officials, lawyers, and NGO representatives, as well as on-site visits, all conducted by Human Rights Watch in 2019 and 2020. Some interviews took place at locations in the OPT and Israel, but, in part due to movement restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic, many were conducted by phone.\nHuman Rights Watch conducted most of the interviews that are included in this report individually, in Arabic or English. We conducted them with the consent of those being interviewed and told each of the interviewees how Human Rights Watch would use the information provided.\nHuman Rights Watch is withholding names of some interviewees for their security, giving them instead pseudonyms, which are noted at first mention between quotation marks.\nHuman Rights Watch also wrote to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on July 20, 2020, soliciting the government’s perspectives generally on the issues covered. A copy of the letter is included in the appendix of this report. The Prime Minister’s Office confirmed receipt by phone on August 6 and by email on August 12, but, as of publication, had not responded.\n# I. Background\nMore than 700,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled from their homes and more than 400 Palestinian villages were destroyed in events around the establishment of the Israeli state in 1948.[[5]] Between 1949 and 1966, Israeli authorities placed most of the Palestinians who remained within the borders of the new state under military rule, confining them to dozens of enclaves, requiring them to obtain permits to leave their enclaves, and severely restricting their rights.[[6]] \nIn June 1967, Israel seized control of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, from Jordan and the Gaza Strip from Egypt, which make up the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT), as well as the Golan Heights from Syria, and the Sinai Peninsula from Egypt, following an armed conflict known as the Six-Day War.\nIsraeli authorities have since retained control over the OPT. In the occupied West Bank, the Israeli army has militarily ruled over Palestinians living there, except in East Jerusalem, which Israel unilaterally annexed in 1967. Annexation does not change East Jerusalem’s status as occupied territory under international law. Throughout the West Bank, Israel has facilitated the building of Israeli-only settlements. The Fourth Geneva Convention, which applies to military occupations, prohibits the transfer of an occupying power’s civilian population to an occupied territory.[[7]] In the occupied Gaza Strip, Israel withdrew its ground troops in 2005, but continues to exert substantial control through other means.\nIsrael also unilaterally annexed the Golan Heights in 1981, though it also remains an occupied territory under international law. Israel ended its occupation of the Sinai Peninsula as a result of the 1978 Camp David Accords with Egypt.\nIn 1993 and 1995, the Israeli government and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) signed the Oslo Accords, which created the Palestinian Authority (PA) to manage some Palestinian affairs in parts of the OPT for a transitional period, not exceeding five years, until the parties forged a permanent status agreement.[[8]] The Oslo Accords, supplemented by later agreements, divided the West Bank largely into three distinct regions: Area A, where the PA would manage full security and civil affairs, Area B, where the PA would manage civil affairs and Israel would have security control, and Area C, under the exclusive control of Israel. Area A largely incorporates the major Palestinian city centers, Area B the majority of towns and many villages, and Area C the remaining 60 percent of the West Bank.[[9]] The Oslo Accords, though, did not end the occupation in any part of the OPT.\nThe parties did not reach a final status agreement by 2000 and have not in the two decades since, despite off and on negotiations primarily mediated by the US. The West Bank remains primarily divided between Areas A, B, and C, with Israel retaining overall principal control and the PA managing some affairs in Areas A and B. In Gaza, Hamas has effectively governed since seizing control in June 2007 following months of clashes between the Palestinian political parties Fatah and Hamas and more than a year of political uncertainty after Hamas won a plurality of seats in PA elections.[[10]] In January 2020, the Trump Administration presented its “Peace to Prosperity” plan, which envisions permanent Israeli domination over the entire territory and formal annexation of settlements, the Jordan Valley, and other parts of Area C.[[11]] It also calls for a Palestinian state, but sets conditions that make its realization nearly impossible.\nThe decades-long “peace process” has neither significantly improved the human rights situation on the ground nor altered the reality of overall Israeli control across Israel and the OPT. Instead, the peace process is regularly cited to oppose efforts for rights-based international action or accountability,[[12]] and as cover for Israel’s entrenched discriminatory rule over Palestinians in the OPT.[[13]] \nIn recent years, Israeli officials have vowed to unilaterally annex additional parts of the West Bank,[[14]] and the coalition agreement that led to the formation of an Israeli government in May 2020 established a process to bring annexation for governmental approval.[[15]] In August, Prime Minister Netanyahu said that Israel would delay the move following an agreement with the United Arab Emirates, but noted that “there is no change to my plan to extend sovereignty” over the West Bank.[[16]] Annexation would not change the reality of Israeli occupation or the protections due to Palestinians as an occupied population under international humanitarian law.\nAlthough the mechanics and intensity of the abuses differ between the OPT and Israel, the same power, the government of the state of Israel, has primary control across both. That authority governs all Jewish Israelis in Israel and the OPT under a single body of laws (Israeli civil law) and, to ensure their domination, structurally discriminates against Palestinians and represses them to varying degrees across different areas on issues such as security of legal status and access to land and resources, as the report documents. Across Israel and the OPT, Israel grants Jewish Israelis privileges denied to Palestinians and deprives Palestinians of fundamental rights on account of their being Palestinian.\nWhile the role of different Israeli state entities varies in different parts of the OPT—with the army, for example, primarily administering the West Bank and exerting control from outside the territory in Gaza, whereas the same civil authorities that govern in Israel also rule over East Jerusalem—they all operate under the direction of the Israeli government headed by the prime minister. Every Israeli government since 1967 has pursued or maintained abusive policies in the OPT. In the West Bank, at least ten government ministries directly fund projects to serve settlements, and a Settlement Affairs Ministry was formed in May 2020.[[17]] The Knesset has also passed laws and formed committees that apply exclusively there.[[18]] The Israeli Supreme Court serves as the court of last resort for Israeli actions in both Israel and the OPT and has ruled on major cases that have determined policies in both territories.[[19]] Quasi-state bodies, such as the World Zionist Organization (WZO) and the Jewish National Fund (JNF), have also supported activities in both the OPT and Israel.[[20]] \n# II. The Crimes Against Humanity of Apartheid and Persecution\nThe prohibition of crimes against humanity is among the most fundamental in international criminal law. The concept, which dates back more than one hundred years and became clearly part of international criminal law in the 1945 Charter of the International Military Tribunal that created the court that prosecuted members of the leadership of Nazi Germany in Nuremberg, refers to a small number of the most serious crimes under international law.[[21]] \nThe 1998 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, which came into force in 2002, sets out 11 crimes that can amount to a crime against humanity when “committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, with knowledge of the attack.”[[22]] The statute defines “attack” as a “course of action involving the multiple commission of acts… pursuant to or in furtherance of a State or organizational policy.” “Widespread” refers to the scale of the acts or number of victims,[[23]] whereas “systematic” indicates a “pattern or methodological plan.”[[24]] Crimes against humanity can be committed during peace or armed conflict.\nThe Explanatory Memorandum of the Rome Statute explains that crimes against humanity “are particularly odious offenses in that they constitute a serious attack on human dignity or grave humiliation or a degradation of one or more human beings. They are not isolated or sporadic events but are part either of a government policy (although the perpetrators need not identify themselves with this policy) or of a wide practice of atrocities tolerated or condoned by a government or a de facto authority.”[[25]] \nAmong the 11 distinct crimes against humanity are the crimes of apartheid and persecution. There is no hierarchy among crimes against humanity; they are of the same gravity and lead to the same consequences under the Rome Statute.\nThe State of Palestine acceded to the Rome Statute in 2015.[[26]] It filed a declaration that gives the International Criminal Court jurisdiction over crimes in the Rome Statute, including the crimes against humanity of apartheid and persecution that are alleged to have been committed in the OPT since June 13, 2014.[[27]] \n## Apartheid\n### General Prohibition\nApartheid, a term originally coined in relation to specific practices in South Africa, has developed over the past half-century into a universal legal term incorporated in international treaties, numerous UN resolutions, and the domestic law of many countries to refer to a particularly severe system of institutional discrimination and systematic oppression.[[28]] Apartheid is prohibited as a matter of customary international law.[[29]] \nAccording to the International Law Commission (ILC), the prohibition against apartheid represents a peremptory norm of international law.[[30]] The ILC describes apartheid as “a serious breach on a widespread scale of an international obligation of essential importance for safeguarding the human being,” noting its prohibition in a range of legal instruments within states and “general agreement among Governments as to the peremptory character” of the prohibition.[[31]] The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD), which has 182 states parties,[[32]] including Israel and Palestine, declares that “States Parties particularly condemn racial segregation and apartheid and undertake to prevent, prohibit and eradicate all practices of this nature in territories under their jurisdiction.”[[33]] \n### International Criminal Law\nBeyond its mere prohibition, apartheid has also been recognized as a crime against humanity for more than 50 years. The 1968 Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes declared that crimes against humanity included “inhuman acts resulting from the policy of apartheid.”[[34]] \nIn 1973, the UN General Assembly adopted a specific convention on apartheid, the Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid (“Apartheid Convention”), declaring it to constitute a crime against humanity.[[35]] The Apartheid Convention, which came into force in 1976 and has 109 states parties, including the state of Palestine but not Israel, states:\n> The term “the crime of apartheid”, which shall include similar policies and practices of racial segregation and discrimination as practiced in southern Africa, shall apply to the following **> inhuman acts\n**> committed for the **> purpose of establishing and maintaining domination\n**> by one racial group of persons over any other racial group of persons and **> systematically oppressing them…\n**[> [36]\n] \nThe Apartheid Convention then identifies a number of “inhuman acts” that, when committed for the purpose of domination and systematic oppression, make up the crime of apartheid, including:\n> (b) Deliberate imposition on a racial group or groups of living conditions calculated to cause its or their physical destruction in whole or in part;\n> (c) **> Any legislative measures and other measures calculated to prevent a racial group or groups from participation in the political, social, economic and cultural life of the country and the deliberate creation of conditions preventing the full development of such a group or groups\n**> , in particular by denying to members of a racial group or groups basic human rights and freedoms, including the right to work, the right to form recognised trade unions, the right to education, **> the right to leave and to return to their country, the right to a nationality, the right to freedom of movement and residence, the right to freedom of opinion and expression, and the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association\n**> ;\n> (d) Any measures including legislative measures, designed to divide the population along racial lines by the **> creation of separate reserves and ghettos for the members of a racial group or groups\n**> , the prohibition of mixed marriages among members of various racial groups,\n**> the expropriation of landed property belonging to a racial group or groups or to members thereof.\n**[> [37]\n] \nThe 1977 Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions, with 174 states parties, identifies “practices of apartheid and other inhuman and degrading practices involving outrages upon personal dignity, based on racial discrimination” as a grave breach of the treaty.[[38]] \nThe Rome Statute of 1998, which has 123 states parties, identifies apartheid as a crime against humanity, defining it as:\n**> Inhumane acts\n**> of a character similar to those referred to in paragraph 1, committed in the context of an **> institutionalized regime of systematic oppression and domination\n**> by one racial group over any other racial group or groups and **> committed with the intention of maintaining that regime\n**> .\n[> [39]\n] \nIn setting out what constitutes inhumane acts, the statute lists a series of crimes against humanity, including “deportation or forcible transfer,” “persecution,” and “other inhumane acts of a similar character intentionally causing great suffering, or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health.”[[40]] To amount to apartheid, these acts must take place in the context of an institutionalized regime of systematic domination and oppression and committed with the intention of maintaining that regime.[[41]] \nThe International Law Commission also included the crime of apartheid in its draft proposed treaty on Crimes Against Humanity, incorporating the Rome Statute definition of the crime.[[42]] \n[![202104mena_israelpalestine_elementsofapartheid] \nClick to expand Image\n] \n### Definition of Key Terms\nNo court has to date heard a case involving the crime of apartheid and therefore interpreted the meaning of the following terms as set out in the Apartheid Convention and Rome Statute definitions of the crime of apartheid:\nRacial Group: Both the Apartheid Convention and Rome Statute use the term “racial group,” but neither defines it.[[43]] The development of the Apartheid Convention against the backdrop of events in southern Africa in the 1970s, as referenced in the text of the Convention, as well as the non-inclusion of other categories beyond race, and the rejection of proposals by some states to expand the treaty’s scope, could lead to a narrower interpretation focused on divisions based on skin color.[[44]] While discussion of the meaning of “racial group” during the drafting of the Rome Statute appears to have been minimal,[[45]] its inclusion in the definition of apartheid, after the end of apartheid in South Africa and when international human rights law had clearly defined racial discrimination to include differences of ethnicity, descent, and national origin, indicates that “racial group” within the Rome Statute reflects, and would likely be interpreted by courts to reflect, a broader conception of race.\nThe International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD), which was adopted in 1965 and came into legal force in 1969, defines “racial discrimination” as “any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life.”[[46]] The Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD), the UN body charged with monitoring the implementation of the ICERD, has consistently found that members of racial and ethnic groups, as well as groups defined based on descent or their national origin, face racial discrimination.[[47]] Rather than treat race as constituting only genetic traits, Human Rights Watch uses this broader definition.\nNo international criminal case has ruled on the definition of “racial group” in the context of the crime against humanity of apartheid. But international criminal courts, in the context of more recent genocide cases, have addressed the meaning of “national, ethnical, racial or religious group” in the definition of that crime in part by evaluating group identity based on context and the construction of local actors, in particular the perpetrators, as opposed to earlier approaches that focused on hereditary physical traits. The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) held that the assessment of whether a particular group may be considered as protected from the crime of genocide “will proceed on a case-by-case basis, taking into account both the evidence proffered and the political, social and cultural context.”[[48]] The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) also found that determinations should be “made on a case-by-case basis, consulting both objective and subjective criteria.” The court, in particular, held that national, ethnic, racial or religious groups should be identified “by using as a criterion the stigmatisation of the group, notably by the perpetrators of the crime, on the basis of its perceived national, ethnical, racial or religious characteristics.”[[49]] The ICTY held in a 1999 case that “to attempt to define a national, ethnical or racial group today using objective and scientifically irreproachable criteria would be a perilous exercise.”[[50]] \nAn understanding of “racial group” in line with ICERD’s conception of “racial discrimination” and international criminal courts’ “subjective approach” to determining racial and other groups mirrors the evolution in how the social sciences understand race and gives coherence to the meaning of race across international law.[[51]] \nIsraeli law has also interpreted race broadly, not limiting it to skin color. The Israeli Penal Code defines racism, in the context of the crime of “incitement to racism,” as “persecution, humiliation, degradation, a display of enmity, hostility or violence, or causing violence against a public or parts of the population, all because of their color, racial affiliation or national ethnic origin.”[[52]] Under Article 7A of Israel’s Basic Law: The Knesset—1958, which bars candidates from running for office if they engage in “incitement,”[[53]] Israel’s Supreme Court has barred candidates, such as from the Jewish Power (Otzma Yehudit) party, from running for office based on vitriolic comments made about Palestinians.[[54]] \nWhile it is beyond the scope of this report to analyze the group identities of Jewish Israelis or Palestinians, it is clear that in the local context, Jewish Israelis and Palestinians are regarded as separate identity groups that fall within the broad understanding of “racial group” under international human rights law. The 1950 Law of Return, which guarantees Jews the right to immigrate to Israel and gain citizenship, defines “Jew” to include “a person who was born of a Jewish mother,” embracing a descent-based, as opposed to a purely religious, classification.[[55]] Many in Israel characterize the virulently anti-Palestinian positions of the Jewish Power party, and before that the Kach Party, as “racist.”[[56]] Prominent Israelis also labeled as “racist” or “race-baiting” a warning that Netanyahu issued to his supporters on election day 2015 that “Arab voters are coming out in droves to the polls.”[[57]] \nMeanwhile, on account of their identity, Palestinians face discrimination and repression, as this report makes clear. Palestinians have deep cultural, political, economic, social, and family ties across Israel, the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip. For much of the modern era, Palestinians moved freely across these areas, which constituted mandatory Palestine, under British administration, in the post-World War I era. The Palestine Liberation Organization Charter defines Palestinians as “those Arab nationals who, until 1947, normally resided in Palestine,” emphasizing that the identity is “transmitted from parents to children.”[[58]] Even within Israel where both Jews and Palestinians are citizens, authorities classify Jews and Palestinians as belonging to different“nationalities.”[[59]] \nCERD found in its latest review of Israel’s record under ICERD in December 2019 that Palestinians in Israel and the OPT constitute a minority group deserving of protection against “all policies and practices of racial segregation and apartheid” in comparison to Jewish communities.[[60]] \nInstitutionalized Regime: This term, incorporated into the Rome Statute but not the Apartheid Convention, appears to have originated in a proposal from the US delegation during the drafting to limit the application of the crime of apartheid to states and exclude non-state groups.[[61]] Alongside the term “systematic,” which appears in both the Apartheid Convention and Rome Statute, the term “regime” underscores the existence of formal organization and structure, and more than isolated discriminatory policies or acts.[[62]] The system can cover entire states or more limited geographic areas, depending on the allocation of power, unity of authority, or differing oppressive laws, policies, and institutions, among other factors.\nDomination: This term, which lacks a clear definition in law, appears in context to refer to an intent by one group to maintain heightened control over another, which can involve control over key levers of political power, land, and resources. The reference is found in both the Rome Statute and Apartheid Convention.\nThe focus on domination, as opposed to formal sovereignty, also indicates that the crime of apartheid can be carried out by authorities outside its own territory and with respect to non-citizens.[[63]] A finding that authorities of one state have committed the crime of apartheid in an external territory would no more undermine the formal sovereignty the other state enjoys or detract from the factual reality of occupation than would a finding that other crimes against humanity or war crimes had been carried out there.[[64]] \nSystematic Oppression: This term, also without a clear definition in law, appears to refer to the methods used to carry out an intent to maintain domination. The reference in the Apartheid Convention to “policies and practices of racial discrimination as practiced in southern Africa” indicates that oppression must reach a high degree of intensity to meet the requisite threshold for the crime.[[65]] \n## Persecution\nThe crime of persecution traces back to the 1945 International Military Tribunal in Nuremberg. The tribunal’s charter recognizes “persecutions on political, racial or religious grounds” as crimes against humanity.[[66]] \nThe Rome Statute also identifies persecution as a crime against humanity, defining it as “the intentional and severe deprivation of fundamental rights contrary to international law by reason of the identity of the group or collectivity.”[[67]] The statute broadened the scope of the crime to encompass “any identifiable group or collectivity on political, racial, national, ethnic, cultural, religious, gender as defined in paragraph 3, or other grounds that are universally recognized as impressible under international law.”[[68]] The statute limits the crime to applying only “in connection with” other crimes identified under it.[[69]] The customary international law definition of persecution, though, includes no such limitation.[[70]] \nInternational criminal lawyer Antonio Cassese, who served as a judge in the leading ICTY case that examined persecution within international criminal law (Prosecutor v. Kupreskic), identified the crime against humanity of persecution as a crime under customary international law.[[71]] He defined persecution under customary international law as referring to acts that a) result in egregious or grave violations of fundamental human rights, b) are part of a widespread or systematic practice, and c) are committed with discriminatory intent.[[72]] \nNeither the Rome Statute nor customary international law clearly set the threshold of what constitutes a violation that is sufficiently “severe” or “egregious.” Human Rights Watch recognizes that many human rights violations cause serious harm. However, for the determination of whether the crime against humanity of persecution has been committed, Human Rights Watch requires the most serious forms of violations before the requirements of “severe” or “egregious” can be met.\n## Legal Consequences of Finding Crimes Against Humanity\nThe commission of crimes against humanity can serve as the basis for individual criminal liability not only in the domestic courts of the perpetrator country but also in international courts and tribunals, as well as in domestic courts outside the country in question under the principle of universal jurisdiction. Individual criminal liability extends beyond those who carry out the acts to those who order, assist, facilitate, aid, and abet the offense. Under the principle of command responsibility, military, and civilian officials up to the top of the chain of command can be held criminally responsible for crimes committed by their subordinates when they knew or should have known that such crimes were being committed but failed to take reasonable measures to prevent the crimes or punish those responsible.\nIn December 2019, ICC Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda concluded a nearly five-year preliminary inquiry into the Palestine situation and determined that “all the statutory criteria” to proceed with a formal investigation of alleged serious crimes by Israelis and Palestinians had been met. The prosecutor found a “reasonable basis” to believe that war crimes had been committed by Israeli and Palestinian authorities but did not reference any crimes against humanity.[[73]] Although the prosecutor did not require formal judicial authorization to move forward with a formal investigation, she nonetheless sought a ruling from the court’s judges on the ICC’s territorial jurisdiction before proceeding.[[74]] \nIn February 2021, the court ruled that it had jurisdiction over crimes committed in the OPT, including East Jerusalem, confirming Palestine’s status as a state party to the Rome Statute able to confer that jurisdiction.[[75]] This jurisdiction would include the ability to prosecute the crimes against humanity of apartheid and persecution. In March 2021, the Office of the Prosecutor announced the opening of a formal investigation into the situation in Palestine.[[76]] \nIsrael signed the Rome Statute in 2000, but did not ratify it and said in August 2002 that it did not intend to do so.[[77]] However, the ICC has jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute any person, including those of Israeli nationality, where there is evidence that they are criminally responsible for the commission of the crimes against humanity of persecution or apartheid within any state that has ratified the Rome Statute, where the relevant criteria are met. That includes Palestine, allowing for the prosecution of crimes that Israeli nationals commit in the OPT.\nThe Apartheid Convention also calls on states parties to prosecute those who commit the crime and over whom they have jurisdiction, as well as to take other measures aimed at “prevention, suppression and punishment” of the crime of apartheid.[[78]] \nIsraeli law criminalizes crimes against humanity, including persecution but not apartheid, only in the context of crimes committed in Nazi Germany.[[79]] Palestinian law does not criminalize crimes against humanity.\n# III. Intent to Maintain Domination\nIsraeli government policy has long sought to engineer and maintain a Jewish majority in Israel and maximize Jewish Israeli control over land in Israel and the OPT. Laws, planning documents, and statements by officials demonstrate that the pursuit of domination by Jewish Israelis over Palestinians, in particular over demographics and land, guides government policy, and actions to this day.\nThis chapter will show that this objective amounts to an intent to maintain domination by one group over another. When inhumane acts are carried out in the context of systematic oppression pursuant to that intent to maintain domination, the crime against humanity of apartheid is committed.\nDiscriminatory intent, when it gives rise to severe abuses of fundamental rights, also makes up the crime against humanity of persecution.\nTo analyze the motivations behind Israeli policies towards Palestinians today, which developed over many years with much of the architecture established in the early years of the state and the occupation, this chapter considers materials that in some cases date back decades. This does not implicate every official cited in seeking to dominate Palestinians. In fact, some Israeli officials and parties advocated positions that, if implemented, could have avoided such policies.\nIsraeli authorities justify some of these policies in the name of security, but, as this chapter shows, they often use security as a justification to advance demographic objectives. In other cases, officials advocate for policies to safeguard Israel’s identity as a Jewish state. Israel can, like any other state, seek to promote a particular identity, but that does not include a license to violate fundamental rights. Not all policies designed to promote Judaization constitute rights abuses. Particular policies can, though, provide evidence of a discriminatory intent or purpose to maintain domination by Jewish Israelis.\nEven policies designed to fulfill legitimate security objectives must comply with international law. As this chapter will show, Israeli authorities have pursued many policies in ways that manifest a discriminatory intent to systematically dominate Palestinians. The legitimate objective of ensuring security does not negate an illegitimate intent to dominate or discriminate that is inherent in these policies.\n## Demographics\nDemographic considerations, in particular the quest for a strong Jewish majority, have long underlined Israeli government policy. The key declarative line of Israel’s Proclamation of Independence proclaims the “establishment of a Jewish state in Eretz-Israel.”[[80]] The proclamation largely narrates the history of the Jewish people and twice in the short document underscores the centrality of Jewish immigration. While the proclamation does commit itself to “complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants,” it presents the newly established state as belonging to the Jewish people, describing Israel as “their state.”\nIsrael’s Basic Laws, which have constitutional status in the absence of a full constitution, re-enforce that the state is Jewish, rather than belonging to all its citizens. The Basic Law: The Knesset—1958, for example, declares that no candidate can run for the Knesset if they expressly or implicitly endorse “negation of the existence of the State of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state.”[[81]] The Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty sets out its purpose as to “establish… the values of the state of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state.”\nThe Basic Law: Israel—The Nation-State of the Jewish People (‘Nation-State Law’) passed in 2018, in effect affirms the supremacy of the “Jewish” over the “democratic” character of the state. The Nation-State Law sets out amid its “basic principles” that Israel is “the nation state of the Jewish people” and that the “exercise of the right to national self-determination in the state of Israel is unique to the Jewish people.” Article 7 further states that “the State views the development of Jewish settlement as a national value and shall act to encourage and promote its establishment and strengthening.”[[82]] Unlike Israel’s Proclamation of Independence, the Nation-State Law contains no language about equality. A Knesset legal advisor said he sought to include “mention of the issue of equality and the issue of the state belonging to all citizens, [but] the committee chose not to make this into a law.”[[83]] In June 2018, several Knesset members sought to introduce a bill to define Israel as a state of all its citizens, but the Knesset presidium disqualified it before it could be discussed since it “seeks to deny Israel’s existence as the state of the Jewish people,” the Knesset legal advisor said.[[84]] \nIsrael’s occupation of the OPT in 1967 amplified Israeli concerns about demographics. Within Israel’s pre-1967 borders, Jews currently represent about 81 percent of the population, as compared to about 19 percent of Palestinians.[[85]] But, when combining all of the OPT with Israel, Jews and Palestinians are in rough parity. And even when restricting the calculus to Israel and the West Bank, the part of the OPT that Israeli authorities covet for Jewish settlement, and excluding Gaza’s significant Palestinian population, the Jewish majority stands at 59 percent compared to 41 percent Palestinians. Many of the practices outlined in this report can be traced to the Israeli government’s desire to maintain Jewish control while retaining the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, which adds 3.1 million Palestinians to the land it controls, in addition to the 1.6 million who reside in Israel.[[86]] \nStatements by Israeli prime ministers and other senior officials highlight the extent to which the intent to maintain demographic control has guided policymaking. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in a March 10, 2019, post on the social media platform Instagram, stated, “Israel is not a state of all its citizens,” but rather “the nation-state of the Jewish people and only them.”[[87]] In December 2003, in between terms as prime minister, Netanyahu said at a conference that \"if there is a demographic problem, and there is, it is with the Israeli Arabs who will remain Israeli citizens,\" noting the need to balance policies that strive to integrate “Israel’s Arabs” with ensuring they do not reach 35-40 percent of the population.[[88]] He warned that “if their numbers will reach 35-40 percent of the country, then the Jewish state will be annulled.”[[89]] He also stated that the separation barrier, ostensibly erected to enhance Israel’s security, would also help to prevent a “demographic spillover” of Palestinians from the West Bank.[[90]] \nDemographic-driven policymaking extends beyond Prime Minister Netanyahu. Even Israeli leaders who supported Israel’s withdrawal from a greater portion of the West Bank than others did often make demographics—the need for Israel to preserve a Jewish majority—one of their central arguments. Netanyahu’s predecessor, Ehud Olmert, said in 2003, three years before he became prime minister, that “the demographic issue” would “dictate the solution we must adopt” and that the “formula for the parameters of a unilateral solution are: to maximize the number of Jews; to minimize the number of Palestinians.”[[91]] His predecessor, Ariel Sharon, as prime minister, said in a 2002 Knesset debate that while Palestinian citizens had “rights in the land,” “all rights over the land of Israel are Jewish rights.”[[92]] His predecessor Ehud Barak, when he was prime minister, equated a “Muslim majority” with “destruction of Israel as a Jewish state.”[[93]] His predecessor as prime minister, Shimon Peres, while serving as president in 2012 said that “Israeli settlements in [parts of the West Bank] densely populated with Arabs…can lead to a threatening demographic change” and “places a Jewish majority in the state of Israel at risk.”[[94]] His predecessor as prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin, said that “the red line for Arabs is 20% of the population, that must not be gone over,” explaining that “I want to preserve the Jewish character of the state of Israel.”[[95]] \nWhile states are sometimes associated with a religious or ethnic identity, a states’ prerogative to define its own identity and promote it is not unlimited; it is not a license to violate the fundamental rights of others. Laws and policies adopted by the Israeli government to preserve a Jewish majority have afforded benefits to Jews at the expense of the fundamental rights of Palestinians. Most significantly in demonstrating Israel’s demographic goals is the 1950 Law of Return. It guarantees Jewish citizens of other countries the right to settle in Israel, and its 1952 Citizenship Law entitles them to citizenship.[[96]] The same Citizenship Law, by contrast, denies Palestinian refugees and their descendants, 5.7 million of whom were registered as of February 2021 with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA),[[97]] the ability to enter and live in areas where they or their families once lived and have maintained links to. The right to live in Israel or the OPT is guaranteed to them under international human rights law, alongside the options of integration in place or resettlement elsewhere.[[98]] These policies create a reality where a Jewish citizen of any other country who has never been to Israel can move there or to a West Bank settlement and automatically gain citizenship, while a Palestinian refugee expelled from his home and languishing for more than 70 years in a refugee camp in a nearby country cannot move to either Israel or the OPT.\n[![202104mena_israelpalestine_bornunequal_abroad] \nClick to expand Image\n] \nThe Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law (Temporary Order)—2003, which prohibits Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza with few exceptions from obtaining citizenship or permanent residency in Israel and East Jerusalem further reflects a desire to maintain demographic control.[[99]] Ariel Sharon, commenting in 2005 when he was prime minister on the renewal of the temporary law, said, “There’s no need to hide behind security arguments. There’s a need for the existence of a Jewish state.”[[100]] He later added that authorities had “a correct and important intention of Israel being a Jewish state with a massive Jewish majority” and that “we must do everything so that this state remains a Jewish state in the future.”[[101]] Giora Eiland, national security advisor at the time, who served on a committee in 2005 examining immigration policies, conceded that “the Citizenship Law is the way to overcome the demographic demon.”[[102]] Then-finance minister Benjamin Netanyahu put it more directly during discussions over renewing the law: “Instead of making it easier for Palestinians who want to get citizenship, we should make the process much more difficult, in order to guarantee Israel’s security and a Jewish majority in Israel.”[[103]] Eli Yishai, while serving as minister of interior affairs, said in 2012 that approving a larger number of family unification applications from the West Bank would constitute “national suicide.”[[104]] \nIn practice, the Interior Ministry’s policies and practices have long aimed at ensuring Jewish Israeli demographic control. In 2004, The Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI) released a report finding that the Israeli Interior Ministry’s population registry systematically denies applications by Palestinians and other non-Jews for residency, family reunification, or granting status to children “only because they are non-Jews.” The registry, which ACRI charges “views itself as defender of the Jewish character of the state,” subjects applicants to “organized and methodical bureaucratic harassment” in order to “wear down applicants whose requests the Ministry of Interior does not want to grant,” a policy that particularly harms Palestinians.[[105]] The Interior Ministry continues to erect bureaucratic hurdles, in particular for Palestinians in East Jerusalem.[[106]] At the same time, authorities and quasi-state institutions have for years actively sought to boost Jewish immigration to Israel.[[107]] \nIsraeli authorities have also since 1967 effectively controlled the population registry in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, recording every Palestinian birth, marriage, divorce, address change, and death. Between 1967 and 1994, they struck from it hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, as Human Rights Watch has documented.[[108]] The Israeli army has used residency status to control the ability of Palestinians to reside in, move within, and travel abroad from the West Bank, as well as to travel from Gaza to Israel and the West Bank.[[109]] These restrictions are implemented in so sweeping a fashion that it is difficult to see them as motivated primarily by security –rather than demographic –considerations.[[110]] \nSome Israeli laws provide benefits on the basis of criteria other than nationality, but the purpose remains privileging Jews over Palestinians. These laws often are not discriminatory on their face, using proxies to mask discriminatory intent, even as in some cases officials extoll the demographic logic. For example, in 2002, the Israeli Knesset cut by four percent the child allowance for all Israeli families, but 24 percent for children whose parents had not served in the army.[[111]] The overwhelming majority of Palestinians do not serve in the army. While this law also affects those Orthodox Jews who do not serve in the army, they are eligible for extra subsidies, including educational supplements, not available to Palestinians.[[112]] \nStatements by Israeli officials at the time make clear the discriminatory intent behind this move. Reporting on 2003 and 2004 statistics that showed a drop in the Israeli birthrate, primarily driven by a decline among Palestinian citizens of Israel,*Haaretz*in January 2005 attributed to the Finance Ministry the view that “the drop of birthrate is a clear result of the cutbacks in child support allocations over the past two years.”*Haaretz*quotes a senior Finance Ministry official, who asked to be unnamed, citing the “internal demographic threat” and expressing concern over “the high birthrate of the Arabs, and especially the Negev Bedouin.” The official said that “we are reversing the graph, to defend the Jewish majority in the country,” and warned, according to*Haaretz*, that reinstating the allowance would lead to the state having to support large families in places like the Negev, which would have the effect of undermining the Jewish majority.[[113]] \nWhile at times striking down discriminatory state policies, the Israeli Supreme Court has endorsed demographics-driven decision-making. For example, in a prominent 2000 case declaring that the state could not discriminate directly on the basis of religion and nationality in allocating state land, Supreme Court President Aharon Barak highlighted the favored legal status of Jewish Israelis when it came to acquiring residency. He wrote that “it is true, members of the Jewish nation were granted a special key to enter (see the Law of Return-5710-1950), but once a person has lawfully entered the home, he enjoys equal rights with all other household members.”[[114]] Israel has long used its control over the “house” to maintain a solid Jewish majority, at the expense of Palestinians. Citing another well-known opinion by Barak, Asher Grunis, then deputy president of the Supreme Court and later president, rejected in 2012 a constitutional challenge to the discriminatory aspects of the 2003 Israel Citizenship and Entry Law, writing, “Human rights are not a prescription for national suicide.”[[115]] \n## Control Over Land\nAlongside demographic control, Israeli authorities have sought to ensure Jewish control over the land and natural resources in Israel and the OPT. Israeli authorities have largely pursued the goals of demographic and land domination in parallel, seeking to maximize the land available for Jewish communities and largely confine Palestinians to dense population centers.\nIn February 1948, Ben Gurion, then chairperson of the Jewish Agency before becoming prime minister, reported the night after visiting Lifta,[[116]] a Palestinian village in the suburbs of Jerusalem whose residents fled or were expelled from their homes:\n> When you enter the city through Lifta and Romema, through Mahaneh Yehuda, King George Street and Me’ah She’arim –there are no Arabs. One hundred percent Jews… What happened in Jerusalem and in Haifa—can happen in large parts of the country. If we persist it is quite possible that in the next six or eight months there will be considerable changes in the country, very considerable and to our advantage. There will certainly be considerable changes in the demographic composition of the country.\n[> [117]\n] \nIsrael’s seizure of thousands of dunams of land from Palestinians in 1948 and in subsequent decades in Israel and the OPT have aimed to serve the exclusive interest of Jewish Israelis. Reflecting just on the situation inside Israel, a 2003 Israeli government-commissioned report found that “the expropriation activities were clearly and explicitly harnessed to the interests of the Jewish majority, and the land was transferred to entities such as the Jewish National Fund (JNF), which according to its own definition serves Jewish settlement, or the Israel Land Administration, which, judging from its administration patterns, served a similar objective.”[[118]] The Israel Land Administration manages and allocates 93 percent of the land in Israel,[[119]] meaning this government-commission report found that the state uses the overwhelming majority of land in Israel to serve only one community, Jewish Israelis.\nSemi-governmental bodies like the JNF, Jewish Agency, and WZO that serve the Jewish community and no other constituency, play central roles in this effort. A 1953 Knesset law endows JNF, or Keren Kayemeth LeIsrael in Hebrew, with governmental authorities,[[120]] and Israel’s Basic Law: Israel Lands (1960) notes that ownership over its land “shall not be transferred either by sale or in any other manner.”[[121]] JNF owns 13 percent of Israeli land, which the Israel Land Authority (ILA) manages. JNF makes up nearly half the governing board of the ILA, which controls 93 percent of the land in Israel.[[122]] \nThe explicit mandate of the JNF is to develop and lease land for Jews and not any other segment of the population. Under the terms of its Memorandum and Articles of Association, the JNF acquires property “for the purpose of settling Jews on such lands and properties.”[[123]] In a 2004 court filing, the JNF made clear that it “is not a public body that works for the benefit of all citizens of the state. The loyalty of JNF is given to the Jewish people and only to them is the JNF obligated.”[[124]] The JNF long interpreted its mandate as allowing it to block Palestinians from purchasing, renting, or building on their lands.[[125]] Following a lawsuit brought by rights groups though, Israeli authorities have allowed non-Jews to use JNF land on condition that, if sold to them, the ILA will compensate JNF with land of equal value elsewhere.[[126]] *Haaretz*, though, has reported that Palestinians have faced “red tape” far exceeding what Jews face when purchasing JNF land, delaying registration by years or more.[[127]] \nJNF leaders have also said they have pursued similar policies in the West Bank since 1967.[[128]] The Israeli group Peace Now has documented at least 65,000 dunams of land in the West Bank that the JNF has purchased since 1967 for settlements.[[129]] In February 2021, JNF’s leadership and board approved changing its policies to allow it to expand its purchase of land in the West Bank for settlements.[[130]] \nIsraeli law also affords semi-governmental status to the World Zionist Organization (WZO) and the Jewish Agency. A 1952 law establishes the organizations, then a single entity, as “the authorised agent” of the state “for the development and settlement of the country” and “absorption of immigrants from the Diaspora.”[[131]] The Jewish Agency, whose self-described “historic mandate is to bring Jews home to Israel,” says it helped more than 30,000 Jews in 2018 and more than 250,000 in the last decade immigrate to Israel.[[132]] The WZO, founded in 1897 with a mission that includes “[p]romoting the settlement of Jewish farmers, artisans and tradesmen in Palestine,”[[133]] has played a central role in the settlement enterprise since the early days of the occupation.[[134]] Israeli authorities authorize the WZO to establish settlements and settlers who purchase homes in settlements often sign contracts with the WZO instead of obtaining full title to the property.[[135]] Authorities have directly allocated nearly a third of all “state land,” which often includes lands unlawfully seized from Palestinians, in the West Bank, excluding East Jerusalem, to the WZO, primarily for use in settlements.[[136]] \nThe WZO’s Settlement Division, operating under the direct control of the Israeli government, established most settlements and manages the allocation of land for settlements with the stated purpose to “establish and strengthen Jewish settlement in the country’s periphery through strengthening the hold on state lands given to it by the government.”[[137]] The government provides the division with its entire budget, which amounted to 441.6 million Israeli New Shekel (NIS) (US$132.60 million) between 2009-18.[[138]] Since the early 2000s, the WZO has played a more active role as well in the Negev and the Galilee; the Israeli newspaper*Haaretz*has described them as “the government’s executive arm for construction in the West Bank, as well as in the Negev and the Galilee.”[[139]] \nIsraeli authorities have pursued an explicit policy of ensuring Jewish control over geographic areas with strategic importance where there are concentrations of Palestinians across Israel and the OPT. Judaization of these areas contributed to facilitating Israeli government control over Palestinian population centers, dividing communities, and blocking the establishment of larger, contiguous Palestinian municipal areas in locations that Israeli authorities covet or consider particularly strategic. This strategy also contributes to generally diluting the Palestinian population in some areas and pushing them into crowded population centers.\n### Israel (Galilee and Negev)\nIn Israel, authorities maintain a policy to Judaize the Galilee and Negev regions, one pursued in coordination with the JNF, the Jewish Agency, and the WZO. These areas account for nearly two-thirds of the land in Israel,[[140]] and encompass much of the Palestinian population.[[141]] The Israeli government has a ministry focused on the “development” of the Galilee and the Negev, has invested significantly in these areas, and has considered it a major government priority for much of the past two decades.[[142]] In 2004, the Sharon government unveiled a cross-sectional plan estimated to cost 16.8 NIS billion ($5 billion) that aimed to “increase the number of residents in the Negev to 1.5 million and in the Galilee to 1.1 million by 2010.”[[143]] *Haaretz*described efforts to develop these areas as possibly the “largest settlement effort inside the Green Line in the last 25 years.”[[144]] \nWhile Israeli authorities use non-discriminatory language of seeking to “develop” or “populate” these regions, the Israeli rights group Sikkuy wrote in 2005 that “it is clear to everyone that the plan is intended for Jewish residents.”[[145]] The Negev plan, for example, defined the ideal new residents as a “strong population,” including “families with high income” who work in central Israel, an area that has a much higher proportion of Jews to Palestinians and who will continue to commute to their old jobs.[[146]] Authorities also offered a 90 percent discount on the leasing fees for Negev properties to soldiers who had served for at least one year, an offer that would attract mainly Jews since Bedouins are exempt from military service and only a small percentage volunteer to serve in the army.[[147]] Shimon Peres, then deputy prime minister, described the development of the Negev and the Galilee as a “battle for the future of the Jewish people.”[[148]] The Jewish Agency has said that it sought to guarantee a “Zionist majority” in the Negev and the Galilee, launching its own programs in these areas “to get around the problem that the government must act on behalf of all citizens of the state of Israel while the WZO is entitled to act for the sake of the Jewish people.”[[149]] The government approved the WZO establishing settlements in these areas.[[150]] \nIn December 2007, Minister for the Development of the Negev and Galilee Jacob Edery, reflecting on new demographic data, said, “We have to do everything we can to boost Jewish population in the Galilee.”[[151]] In 2011, the Israeli Knesset passed a law permitting towns in the Negev and Galilee with up to 400 households to maintain admissions committees that can reject applicants from living there for being “not suitable for the social life of the community” or for incompatibility with the “social-cultural fabric.”[[152]] The law’s sponsors openly spoke about how the law would facilitate the creation and maintenance of Jewish-only communities.[[153]] In June 2019, then Transportation Minister Bezalel Smotrich said that “I intend to Judaize the Galilee” and “lay down a network of roads, to complete a revolution, so that hundreds of thousands of Jews will come to live in the Galilee.”[[154]] The month before, the JNF announced its aim to bring 1.5 million residents to the Negev and Galilee by 2040.[[155]] \n[![202104mena_israelpalestine_intenttodominate] \nClick to expand Image\n] \nThe government’s historic policies towards these areas provide further context for determining the intent behind its current policies. The plan to Judaize the Galilee, a region largely slated to fall within the “Arab State” in the 1947 UN Partition Plan, dates back to the 1950s when it emerged as part of a strategy to consolidate Israeli control of the area.[[156]] A senior Israeli official at the time wrote that the Palestinian presence in these areas threatened Israeli control, worrying that Palestinians would “invade all areas we neglect, strike footholds and establish new roots.”[[157]] Ben Gurion told the Knesset that Israel’s imposition of military rule over most Palestinians in Israel at the time aimed “to protect the right to Jewish settlement in all parts of the state.”[[158]] The plan to Judaize the Galilee focused initially on creating and sustaining Jewish communities such as Nazareth Illit (Hebrew for ‘Upper Nazareth’) in 1957, while limiting the growth of nearby Palestinian communities.[[159]] \nThe Israeli newspaper Al HaMishmar in 1976 published a leaked government document drafted by Yisrael Koenig, then northern district commissioner of the Interior Ministry.[[160]] The memo, entitled “Top Secret: Memorandum-Proposal Handling the Arabs of Israel,” lays out the demographic situation in the area, showing that Jews maintain a slight demographic majority but will be overtaken in a few years if birthrates continue at current rates. It then recommends that authorities “expand and deepen Jewish settlement in areas where the contiguity of the Arab population is prominent, and where they number considerably more than the Jewish population; [and] examine the possibility of diluting existing Arab population concentrations.” While officials condemned the plan and said it had not been acted on,[[161]] Koenig remained in his role for more than a decade after the memo’s publication, a leaked 1995 map by a regional planning committee echoed similar objectives, and elements of the strategy bear resemblance to policies that have been carried out since.[[162]] \nIn the Negev region, some officials immediately after 1948 called for forcibly relocating the 11,000 of the original 65,000-95,000 Palestinian Bedouins who had not been forced to flee to surrounding areas.[[163]] The government, though, adopted a plan supported by Yigal Allon, commander of the southern front and military governor of the Negev, that allowed Bedouin communities to remain, but concentrated them in a circumscribed area in order to remove them from key Negev routes and secure the land for settling Jews and building army bases.[[164]] Concentrating Palestinian Bedouin communities on limited pieces of territory remains at the heart of Israeli government plans for the Negev.\nThe strategy of maximizing Jewish settlement alongside suppression of the Palestinian population continues. In the Negev, for example, Sharon in December 2000, just before becoming prime minister and pursuing the development of the Negev as a principal goal, wrote:\n> In the Negev, we face a serious problem: About 900,000 dunams of government land are not in our hands, but in the hands of the Bedouin population. I, as a resident of the Negev, see this problem every day. It is, essentially, a demographic phenomenon… Out of weakness, perhaps also lack of awareness about the issue, we, as a country, are doing nothing to confront this situation… The Bedouin are grabbing new territory. They are gnawing away at the country’s land reserves, and no one is doing anything significant about it.\n[> [165]\n] \nIn July 2009, Israel’s Housing Minister Ariel Atias warned against “the spread” of Palestinian communities, warning that, “if we go on like we have until now, we will lose the Galilee.”[[166]] Later that year, Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon said “we are losing the Negev and the Galilee,” noting that “in many places there is no contiguous Jewish presence” and that “the focus for today is to Judaize the Negev and the Galilee.”[[167]] \n### Jerusalem\nThe Israeli government’s formal policy for Jerusalem, including both west and the occupied east, is to pursue “maintaining a solid Jewish majority in the city,” as stated in the government’s plan for the municipality (“Jerusalem Outline Plan 2000”), and limiting the number of Palestinian residents. Concern with demographics in Jerusalem dates back to the early days of the state but accelerated with Israel’s unilateral annexation of occupied East Jerusalem and parts of surrounding villages in 1967. Annexation expanded the boundaries of the city that Israeli authorities consider the country’s capital, but also brought more Palestinians into an area that authorities treat as part of its sovereign territory. To mitigate the demographic effect of this move, authorities granted Palestinians from East Jerusalem permanent residency rather than an easy path to citizenship and instituted other policies aimed to foster and maintain a Jewish demographic majority in the city.\nFollowing annexation, Israeli officials set a target “ratio of 70% Jews and 30% Arab,” although planners later acknowledged that “this goal is not attainable” in light of “the demographic trend” and adjusted it to a 60-40 percent target.[[168]] Within Palestinian communities, the plan, by its own terms, “enables a densification of the rural villages and densification and thickening of the existing urban neighborhoods.”[[169]] \nWhen delineating Jerusalem’s municipal boundaries in 1967, authorities primarily focused on, as the Israeli rights group B’Tselem puts it, “demographic concerns, chief among them to leave out densely populated Palestinian areas in order to ensure a Jewish majority in Jerusalem.”[[170]] Israel, in total, added 72 square kilometers, including land that belonged to 28 surrounding West Bank villages, to the Jerusalem municipality. Former Deputy Mayor of Jerusalem Meron Benvenisti wrote that Jerusalem’s “absurd” borders “derived from the aspiration to include ‘a maximum of land with a minimum of Arabs.’”[[171]] \nIsraeli officials, soon after taking control of East Jerusalem in 1967, confiscated land and established several settlements, including Ramat Eshkol, Ma’alot Dafna, Givat HaMivtar, and French Hill, to establish a “bolt,” in the parlance of the Israeli government, connecting West Jerusalem and Mount Scopus, which was effectively a Jewish island encircled by East Jerusalem before 1967.[[172]] Israeli authorities also confiscated land to establish other settlements, including Ramot Alon and Gilo, to create a “ring,” as they described it, around the center of Jerusalem and, as one academic writes, “thus preventing any prospect for a continuity of Arab neighborhoods.”[[173]] The establishment of a “bolt” and “ring” around Jerusalem, which authorities continued to fortify through the expansion of settlements in subsequent years, aimed at bolstering Israeli Jewish control over the city.[[174]] \nThe newly-annexed area included 66,000 Palestinian residents, 24 percent of the new municipality’s population. A government commission set up in late 1972 to evaluate Israeli policy in Jerusalem recommended the government strive to maintain the “ratio of Jews to Arabs that existed at the end of 1972,” or 73.5 percent Jewish Israeli and 26.5 Palestinian.[[175]] The government adopted this recommendation and subsequent governments have reaffirmed it.[[176]] When formulating Israel’s first municipal plan for Jerusalem in 1975, Israel Kimhi, then director of planning policy at the Interior Ministry, said, “One of the cornerstones in the planning of Jerusalem is the demographic question,” noting that governmental policy toward “the growth of the city and the preservation of the demographic balance” would serve as “one of the yardsticks for the success of the solidification of Jerusalem’s status as the capital of Israel.”[[177]] \nTeddy Kollek, the mayor of Jerusalem from 1965 to 1993, said in a January 1982 meeting of the Jerusalem municipality that “I am looking after the Jewish majority… that is why we are here, to take care of that” and in a June 1984 meeting that “like all of us here, it seems to me, I am worried about the balance of power and Arab growth within and around Jerusalem,” according to minutes of the meetings reviewed by B’Tselem.[[178]] In a 1990 interview with an Israeli newspaper, Kollek said:\n> For Jewish Jerusalem, I did something in the past twenty-five years. For East Jerusalem? Nothing! What did I do? Nothing. Sidewalks? Nothing. Cultural institutions? Not one. Yes, we installed a sewerage system for them and improved the water supply. Do you know why? Do you think it was for their good, for their welfare? Forget it! There were some cases of cholera there, and the Jews were afraid that they would catch it, so we installed sewerage and a water system against cholera.\n> [> [179]\n] \nThe Israeli government’s decision to apply the 1952Law of Entryto Palestinians from East Jerusalem, the law applicable to foreigners who enter Israel and want to reside there, and offer them permanent residency, instead of automatic citizenship, further demonstrates the extent to which demography dictates Israeli policy in Jerusalem.[[180]] The Jerusalem 2000 Outline Plan makes clear that “the continued proportional growth of the Arab population in Jerusalem is bound to reduce the ratio of the Jewish population in the future” and that, in order to prevent “the continued proportional growth of the Palestinian population in Jerusalem in comparison with the Jewish population [or] even worse, from taking place, we will need far-reaching changes in our approach to the key variables influencing the balance of immigration and gaps in birthrate, variables that ultimately determine the demographic balance.”[[181]] \n### West Bank\nThe Israeli government has pursued the same formulation in the West Bank as in Israel and East Jerusalem: maximum control over the land, largely for the benefit of Jews. While governments have at times differed on what arrangements should govern Palestinians living in the West Bank, the objectives and reality on the ground have remained largely consistent over successive governments. On July 7, 1967, exactly one month after the Israeli army occupied the West Bank, Israel’s then-Prime Minister Levi Eshkol of the Labor Party said, “The security and the land are in Israeli hands.”[[182]] In a party meeting that year, Eshkol clarified that authorities “covet the dowry, not the bride,”[[183]] an apparent reference to wanting the West Bank without the Palestinians who live there. Fifty-two years later, on July 10, 2019, Prime Minister Netanyahu of the Likud said, “Israeli military and security forces will continue to rule the entire territory, up to the Jordan [River].”[[184]] He added on May 28, 2020, that “we are the ones dictating security rules over the entire territory,” describing West Bank Palestinians as “subjects.”[[185]] \nThe current map of the West Bank reflects decades of shifting Israeli governmental plans for the territory. Israel’s earliest plans for the West Bank, including an unofficial plan initially drafted in July 1967 by then-Labor Minister Yigal Allon, envisioned Israeli control over the Jordan Valley and other parts of the West Bank. In an essay he published in 1976 in*Foreign Affairs*explaining the plan, Allon insisted on the necessity of “absolute Israeli control over the strategic zone to the east of the dense Arab population, concentrated as it is on the crest of the hills and westward.”[[186]] The plan, retaining Israel’s control over the Jordan Valley and of the corridor around Jerusalem, effectively divided Palestinians in the West Bank into three enclaves: one in the north from Jenin to Ramallah, one in the south including Hebron and Bethlehem, and one in the east around Jericho.[[187]] \nAllon’s logic focused on the strategic and security importance of Israeli control of the West Bank, but in justifying the need for control without formally annexing territory with large Palestinian populations, references the aim “to preserve [Israel’s] Jewish character.”[[188]] Allon certainly appeared motivated by a desire to safeguard the security of Israel and its citizens, as have subsequent officials. Some regard the settlement enterprise as vital for security.[[189]] Whatever the motive, it is unacceptable to pursue this aim through a strategy of seeking to dominate Palestinians, maintaining a discriminatory system, and engaging in tactics that either have an insufficient security justification or otherwise violate international law. An intent to ensure security neither negates an intent to dominate, nor grants a carte blanche to undertake policies that go beyond what international law permits. While security grounds can justify a range of restrictive measures under international humanitarian and human rights law, a strategy that seeks to promote security by ensuring the demographic advantage of one group of people through discrimination or oppression has no basis under international law.\nSubsequent Israeli policies built on the Allon plan. In October 1977, the Israeli government formally adopted a plan produced by Ariel Sharon, then both the chairperson of the Ministerial Committee for Settlement Affairs and agriculture minister, that expanded on the Allon Plan by strengthening Israeli control in the western West Bank, to the east of the Green Line.[[190]] The plan called for creating rings of “security zones” in order to, as former Israeli official and analyst Shaul Arieli put it, “prevent the Palestinian population from seeping into Israel; to create a Jewish barrier between Israeli Arabs in the Wadi Ara and the ‘Small Triangle’ area [areas in central Israel near the Green Line]; and to control key hilltops overlooking the coastal plain.”[[191]] In November 1978, Israel’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), Avraham Orly, said in a statement to the Supreme Court that settlements “are used mostly [in times of calm] for a show of presence and control over essential areas, for observation and the like.”[[192]] \nThe “Master Plan for the Development of Settlements in Judea and Samaria 1979-1983,” a 1980 plan formulated by the World Zionist Organization’s Settlement Division, the body charged with establishing settlements and fully funded by the government and operating directly under its control, built on the prior schemes. The “Drobles Plan” as it was known, named after its author and head of the Settlement Division, Matityahu Drobles, called for Israeli authorities “to settle the land between the [Arab] minority population centers and their surroundings,” noting that doing so would make it “hard for Palestinians to create territorial contiguity and political unity.” The plan further noted that any autonomy granted to Palestinians, as set out in the Camp David Accords between Egypt and Israel of the late 1970s, did “not apply to the territories but rather to the Arab population alone” and that “there cannot be any shadow of a doubt about our intention to maintain perpetual control over the territory of Judea and Samaria.”[[193]] It adds that “the best and most effective way to remove any trace of doubt about our intention to control Judea and Samaria forever is through accelerated surge of settlements in these areas,” in particular to “create the widest possible spread” of settlements and “establish additional settlements next to every existing settlement.”[[194]] \n[![202104mena_israelpalestine_drobles_oslo_plan] \nClick to expand Image\n] \nThe maps compare the parts of the occupied West Bank that should be prioritized for settlement development under the 1980 Drobles Plan, which guided the Israeli government’s settlement policy at the time, and the division of the territory under the Oslo Accords of the 1990s between areas where Israel maintains full control (Area C) and where Palestinian authorities manage some affairs (Areas A and B).© 2021 Mike King/New York Review of Books\nIn a July 1981 meeting of the Ministerial Committee for Settlement Affairs, Sharon justified designating additional land in the West Bank as firing zones by citing the “spreading of Arab villagers” in the South Hebron Hills, according to minutes of the meeting found in the Israeli State Archives by the Akevot Institute for Israeli-Palestinian Conflict Research.[[195]] Sharon added that “we have an interest in expanding and enlarging the shooting zones there, in order to keep these areas, which are so vital, in our hands.”[[196]] \nIn 1985, defense minister at the time Yitzhak Rabin said that “there will be no development [for Palestinians in the OPT] initiated by the Israeli Government, and no permits will be given for expanding agriculture or industry [there], which may compete with the State of Israel.”[[197]] \nA 1997 strategic plan by the WZO Settlement Division specified a series of additional measures to further cement Israeli rule over the West Bank. It called for expanding “settlement zones” to include military sites, nature reserves, archaeological sites, and adjacent state land, joining them with “topographically high points overlooking settlements, traffic arteries, and infrastructure corridors” to establish “contiguous stretches of land” under Israel’s control. It highlighted several areas of strategic importance, including around Jerusalem, in the northwest West Bank, in the Jordan Valley, in the South Hebron Hills, and the northern edge of the West Bank, for which Israel should remain in control to “serve as buffer zones” and provide settlers “with a completely normal Israeli life in all ways.” It further designates “three strategic lateral corridors,” or strategic roads to run east-west across the West Bank, to serve as the “backbone” connecting the various settlements, “prevent uncontrolled Arab building,” and preserve “balance between the size of the Israeli and Arab populations.”[[198]] \nIn 2001, shortly after his election as prime minister, Sharon said, “It’s not by accident that the settlements are located where they are,” so that “come what may, we have to hold the western security area, which is adjacent to the Green Line, and the eastern security area along the Jordan River and the roads linking the two. And Jerusalem, of course. And the hill aquifer.”[[199]] \nIn 2014, Member of Knesset (MK) Yariv Levin, appointed the following year as Israel’s minister of*aliyah*(Jewish Immigration) and integration, said, “The correct policy, from the point of view of Israeli interests regarding our political ability at the moment, is to combine the attempt to hold the maximum amount of territory and apply sovereignty over the maximum amount of territory while keeping the Arab population within it to a minimum. The situation already exists in Area C, which is under our control –there are little more than fifty thousand Arabs.”[[200]] In February 2021, Avi Naim, who served as director-general for Israel’s Ministry for Settlement Affairs between July and October 2020, underscored the government’s objective to “prevent Palestinian territorial continuity” and “keep control of land reserves in Judea and Samaria”.[[201]] \nIsraeli authorities have taken a variety of steps to limit the numbers of Palestinians in the West Bank, including denying residency rights to Palestinians for being abroad when the occupation began in 1967, or for long periods during the first few decades of the occupation; imposing an effective freeze on family reunification over the past two decades; and largely restricting movement from Gaza to the West Bank, as described in a subsequent chapter of this report.[[202]] Palestinian residents of Area C face an additional obstacle in the authorities’ systematic refusal to grant them permits to build.[[203]] \nWhile officials have sometimes maintained that measures taken in the occupied West Bank are temporary, the government’s actions and policies over more than a half-century make clear the intent to maintain their control over the West Bank in perpetuity. For example, while the Israeli government formally declared that it built the separation barrier in the early 2000s “to reduce the entry of terrorists from Judea and Samaria to carry out terror attacks in Israel,”[[204]] senior Israeli officials have openly spoken about the barrier facilitating the takeover of land.[[205]] B’Tselem and Bimkom– Planners for Planning Rights documented how the route largely aimed to incorporate settlement blocs, while minimizing the number of Palestinians included.[[206]] The Israeli government itself conceded in court proceedings that the expansion plans of settlements factored into its considerations around the route of the barrier, which does not follow the Green Line but rather incorporates on the “Israeli side” thousands of dunams of land.[[207]] \nBeyond the land grabs, authorities have entirely integrated the settlements’ sewage system, communication and road networks, and electrical grids and water infrastructure with Israel proper. In December 2017, the attorney general issued guidelines requiring that all government-sponsored bills specify their application to settlers or otherwise justify why they do not.[[208]] In recent years, the Knesset has passed a growing number of laws that apply specifically to the West Bank, including a law allowing authorities to retroactively expropriate private Palestinian land on which settlements have been built, a law that transfers petitions brought against state policy to an administrative court instead of the Supreme Court and a law that brings universities in settlements under Israel’s Council for Higher Education.[[209]] Whether or not the Israeli government formally annexes additional parts of the West Bank, as Israel’s two largest parties for most of 2019 and 2020, Likud and Blue and White, both vowed to do during the three rounds of Israeli elections between April 2019 and March 2020,[[210]] it has long dominated these areas.\n### Gaza Strip\nFrom 1967 until the early 2000s, Israeli policy towards the occupied Gaza Strip mirrored its approach to the West Bank, maximizing control over the land, privileging the more than 7,500 settlers who lived there,[[211]] and subjugating the Palestinians of Gaza.[[212]] The Israeli government’s withdrawal of its settler population from Gaza in 2005 reflected not a departure from the objective of demographic and land control in the OPT, but rather a recalibration in light of the large Palestinian population inhabiting a small strip of land and the burden of securing a tiny Jewish settler community there. It marked a shift to focus on ensuring Jewish demographic control over the areas it hopes to retain permanently—namely, Israel and much, if not all, of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Withdrawal effectively took the large Palestinian population there off Israel’s demographic balance sheet and allowed Israeli authorities to consolidate a solid Jewish majority in their books across Israel and the remainder of the OPT that they intended to retain, while maintaining control of Gaza via other means.\nIsraeli officials at the time acknowledged the demographic objectives behind the move. On August 15, 2005, the day the Israeli government set as a deadline for settlers to voluntarily leave Gaza, Prime Minister Sharon said in an evening address to Israelis, “Gaza cannot be held onto forever. Over one million Palestinians live there, and they double their numbers with every generation.”[[213]] The same month, then-Deputy Prime Minister Shimon Peres said, “We are disengaging from Gaza because of demography.”[[214]] \nAuthorities, in fact, explicitly said that they wanted to redirect the resources that went into the settler community in Gaza to strengthening Jewish Israeli control over parts of Israel and the West Bank. The early 2000s push, for example, to Judaize the Galilee and the Negev came as Israeli authorities were putting in motion their plans to withdraw from Gaza.*Haaretz*quoted an advisor to Prime Minister Sharon at the time as saying that Sharon “reached the conclusion that following the enormous investment in settling the territories, it is now necessary to settle the Galilee and the Negev.”[[215]] \nFollowing Hamas’s wresting control of the Gaza Strip from the PA in 2007, the Israeli government, which had a practice of security cooperation with the PA but hostile relations with Hamas, announced restrictions on the movement of people and goods into and out of Gaza. It declared Gaza “hostile territory” and took a range of measures aimed at, among other things, weakening the economy.[[216]] As a central part of their policy, Israeli authorities have enforced what they call “a policy of separation” between Gaza and the West Bank, which they say serves “both security and political goals.”[[217]] In March 2019, the*Jerusalem Post*reported that Netanyahu justified allowing funding from Qatar to enter Gaza to support Hamas authorities in order to maintain the divide between Fatah and Hamas and thereby the separation between the West Bank and Gaza.[[218]] \nDemographics factor centrally in Israel’s separation policy. Israeli policy since 2000 has created what Israeli rights groups have called a “one-way permit” from the West Bank to Gaza, whereby, in the rare cases where authorities permit Palestinians to transit between Gaza and the West Bank, they permit it only exclusively in the direction of Gaza.[[219]] The army’s “Procedure for Settlement in the Gaza Strip by Residents of Judea and Samaria,” published in 2018, states that “[i]n 2006, a decision was made to introduce a policy of separation between the Judea and Samaria Area and the Gaza Strip in light of Hamas’ rise to power in the Gaza Strip. The policy currently in effect is aimed at reducing travel between the areas.” The document, though, notes that “a resident of Judea and Samaria may file an application for permanent settlement in the Gaza Strip for any purpose that is considered humanitarian (usually family unification).” It then clarifies that “as settlement of Gaza residents in the Judea and Samaria Area is possible only in the rarest cases… the need to allow the family to be maintained in the Gaza Strip arises.”[[220]] \nIts guidelines for Gaza residents seeking to settle in the West Bank, published in a separate Israeli army document, re-enforce the same policy. It sets out that “for all practical purposes entry of residents of Gaza into the Judea and Samaria Area shall only be allowed in the most exceptional humanitarian cases.” It notes that the deputy defense minister “established that in every case involving the settlement of Gaza residents in the Judea and Samaria Area one should adopt the most restrictive policy” and “clarified that a family relationship, in and of itself, does not qualify as a humanitarian reason that would justify settlement by Gaza residents in the Judea and Samaria Area.”[[221]] \nGisha found, based on information obtained from the Israeli army via Freedom of Information requests, that between 2009 and March 2017, the Israeli army had approved only six applications for Gaza residents to reside in the West Bank, in each case following the filing of a petition to Israel’s Supreme Court. Four of the six cases involved children who had no one to care for them in Gaza.[[222]] By contrast, between January 2011 and August 2014, the army approved 58 applications for West Bank residents to relocate to Gaza on the condition they sign a pledge never to return to the West Bank.[[223]] In addition, between 2004 and 2017, the Israeli army removed back to Gaza more than 130 Palestinians from Gaza living in the West Bank without a valid Israeli-issued permit, but apparently none in the other direction.[[224]] \nThese policies pressure Palestinians to leave the part of the OPT that authorities covet for Jewish settlement—the West Bank—for the Gaza Strip, and join the more than 2 million Palestinians who are effectively off the demographic balance sheet in the lands where Jews reside. Without Gaza, the demographic ratio of Jews to Palestinians between the river and the sea shifts from about 50-50 to a 59-41 Jewish majority.\nIn addition, Israeli officials have at times encouraged the emigration of Palestinians from Gaza out of the OPT altogether.[[225]] In August 2019, a senior official apparently close to Netanyahu told Israeli journalists that authorities were actively promoting the emigration of Palestinians from Gaza and would cover the emigration costs and even allow Palestinians to use an Israeli airfield to leave for their new host countries.[[226]] \n## Fragmentation\nThe fragmentation of Palestinian populations, in part deliberately created through the separation policy between the West Bank and Gaza, the restrictions on movement between East Jerusalem and the rest of the OPT, and the range of restrictions on residency rights, serves as another tool of ensuring domination. In particular, fragmentation divides populations and facilitates the demographic engineering that is key to preserving political control by Jewish Israelis, and further frays political and social ties among Palestinians, thereby weakening resistance to Israeli rule.[[227]] \n## Conclusion\nThe pursuit by Israeli authorities of the objective of maintaining Jewish Israeli control vis-a-vis Palestinians over demographics and land in Israel and the OPT amounts to a “purpose” or purposes “of establishing and maintaining domination by one racial group of persons over any other racial group of persons,” as set out in the Apartheid Convention.[[228]] It also rises to an “intention” or intentions “of maintaining that regime [or regimes of systematic oppression and domination],” as set out in the Rome Statute definition of apartheid,[[229]] and a discriminatory intent or intents, as part of the customary international law definition of persecution. These policies, practices, and statements collectively establish a discriminatory intent by Israeli authorities to maintain systematic domination by Jewish Israelis over Palestinians.\n# IV. Systematic Oppression and Institutional Discrimination\nThe definition of the crime of apartheid under both the Apartheid Convention and Rome Statute requires, in addition to the intent to dominate, systematic oppression, along with the commission of inhumane acts.\nAs just outlined, the Israeli government pursues policies and practices in the OPT and Israel that demonstrate its intent to maintain domination of Jewish Israelis over Palestinians. However, the severity and means used vary according to location.\nIn the OPT, Israel methodically subjugates the more than 5 million Palestinians living there. This chapter will show that these abusive policies are of such intensity that they amount to “systematic oppression” for the purpose of the crime of apartheid.\nInside Israel’s pre-1967 borders, Palestinians hold citizenship, the right to vote and free movement, and encounter less severe policies and practices, but still face institutional discrimination and other abuses.\nBy contrast to the differences in the treatment of Palestinians, Israeli authorities grant all Jewish Israelis the same rights and privileges regardless of which side of the Green Line they live on. The effect, to varying degrees, is to privilege them over Palestinians in most aspects of life, including with legal status, access to land and freedom to build, and allocation of resources and services.\n[![202104mena_israelpalestine_systematicoppression] \nClick to expand Image\n] \n## Systematic Oppression in the OPT\n### West Bank\nSince they seized the West Bank on June 7, 1967, Israeli authorities have ruled over the entire territory. That day, the army issued a proclamation establishing that its West Bank area commander has “all legislative, executive and judicial powers” over the occupied territory.[[230]] Since then, the army has issued hundreds of military orders governing many aspects of everyday life, including regulating freedom of movement and access to land and natural resources, except for in East Jerusalem, which Israel unilaterally annexed in 1967 and has governed under its civil law.[[231]] Israeli authorities have exclusive control over Area C, comprising about 60 percent of the West Bank. Following its establishment in 1994, the PA has managed some affairs in Areas A and B, which comprise the remaining 40 percent, namely, education, health care, and other civil affairs. Israeli authorities, however, greatly restrict its powers even in Areas A and B and retain primary control across the West Bank over many aspects of the lives of Palestinians, including over borders, control of natural resources, airspace, movement of people and goods, security, and the population registry.\nIsraeli settlements and other restrictions effectively concentrate Palestinians in the occupied West Bank into clusters of enclaves. ©2020 UN OCHA\nSince 1967, Israeli authorities have established more than 280 settlements in the West Bank, including 138 they formally recognize, and 150 “outposts”—settlements without formal authorization, but where authorities provide infrastructure, basic services, and security—in the West Bank, as well as 12 settlements in East Jerusalem and several settlement enclaves inside Palestinian neighborhoods in parts of East Jerusalem and Hebron.[[232]] Authorities have done so in violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention’s prohibition against the transfer of an occupying power’s civilian population to occupied territory.[[233]] Israeli authorities bar Palestinians in the West Bank from entering settlements, except as laborers bearing special permits,[[234]] and nearly all settlers are Jewish Israelis.\nIsraeli authorities treat the more than 441,000 Israeli settlers and 2.7 million Palestinians who reside in the West Bank, excluding East Jerusalem, under distinct bodies of law.[[235]] They also treat the two population groups unequally on a range of issues, including protection of civil and political rights; methods of law enforcement; freedom of movement; freedom to build; and access to water, electricity, infrastructure, and other resources and services.\n#### Legal Status\nPalestinians and Jewish Israelis living in the West Bank hold different legal statuses. Palestinians hold identity cards and passports that permit them to reside and work in the West Bank but that do not convey citizenship or nationality.[[236]] Only Palestinians registered in the Israeli-controlled population registry are eligible to receive an identity card or passport. Israeli authorities have refused to register, or denied residency to, hundreds of thousands of West Bank Palestinians on the grounds that they were either outside the territory when the occupation began in 1967 or spent time abroad between 1967 and 1994.[[237]] By contrast, Jewish Israelis living in the West Bank are Israeli citizens who cannot lose that status no matter how many years they spend abroad.\nPalestinians and settlers enjoy vastly different levels of freedom of movement. Israeli authorities bar West Bank Palestinians from entering large sections of the West Bank itself unless they have a difficult-to-obtain, time-limited permit. These sections include East Jerusalem and nearby villages that Israel annexed in 1967, the “seam zone” between the separation barrier and the Green Line, settlements, and areas authorities deem “closed military zones.”[[238]] The separation barrier, slicing in some places through populated Palestinian areas, restricts movement and cuts off many Palestinians from their agricultural lands, while forcing 11,000 Palestinians living in the seam zone, who are barred from entering Israel, to cross the separation barrier to access their own property and some basic services.[[239]] Palestinians also face nearly 600 permanent obstacles to movement, such as checkpoints and roadblocks, located inside the West Bank rather than along the Green Line separating it from Israel.[[240]] Security forces at checkpoints have the authority to turn back Palestinians without reason or, as often is the case, turn a short commute into an hours-long, humiliating journey. In contrast, Israeli authorities permit Israeli settlers, residents, and visitors, along with foreign tourists, largely unfettered freedom of movement throughout the West Bank, including into the seam zone and many closed military zones, but excluding Palestinian population centers, and into East Jerusalem and Israel.[[241]] \nIsrael ostensibly built the separation barrier for security purposes, starting in 2002 during the second*Intifada*. However, officials have acknowledged that it chose its path, 85 percent of which lies inside the West Bank and protrudes up to 22 kilometers beyond the Green Line,[[242]] to accommodate the growth needs of settlements,[[243]] and to maintain the fabric of life of Israeli settlers.[[244]] \nIsraeli authorities apply in parallel different bodies of laws to Palestinians and Jewish Israelis. The Israeli army governs the West Bank under military law, which incorporates laws that existed in the West Bank prior to the beginning of the occupation. While governing Palestinians under military law, the Israeli army has issued military orders that stipulate that Israeli civil and administrative law shall apply to settlements,[[245]] a process that Israeli human rights lawyer Michael Sfard describes as “pipelining,” allowing Israeli authorities to “exercise powers in the settlements without annexing them de jure.”[[246]] In recent years, pursuant to guidelines set by the attorney general in December 2017 requiring that all government-sponsored bills specify that they apply to settlers in the West Bank or otherwise justify why not, several pieces of Knesset legislation directly state that they apply to settlers in the West Bank.[[247]] \nIsraeli authorities also maintain parallel criminal justice systems for settlers and Palestinians in the West Bank, excluding East Jerusalem. Israeli authorities try Palestinians charged with crimes in military courts, where they face a conviction rate of nearly 100 percent.[[248]] By contrast, authorities have passed regulations that extend Israeli criminal law on a personal basis to settlers, and grant Israeli courts jurisdiction over them, while authorities have followed a longstanding policy not to prosecute Jewish settlers in military courts.[[249]] The Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI) found in a 2014 report that “since the 1980s, all Israeli citizens brought to trial before the military courts were Arab citizens and residents of Israel.”[[250]] \nThe application of dual bodies of laws has created a reality where two people live in the same territory, but only one enjoys robust rights protection.[[251]] Settlers, for example, enjoy freedom of speech, which Israeli law restricts only if there is “a near certainty” that it would “seriously jeopardize” vital security interests.[[252]] Palestinians, meanwhile, can face up to ten years in prison for attempting to influence public opinion in a manner that “may” harm public peace or public order.[[253]] Palestinians can also be jailed for participating in a gathering of more than ten people without a permit on an issue “that could be construed as political,”[[254]] while settlers can demonstrate without a permit unless it involves more than 50 people, takes place outdoors and involves “political speeches and statements.”[[255]] Authorities can deny a permit to settlers for such a gathering only when they can show a “near certainty” of harm to public security, public order, or the rights of others.[[256]] \nDiscrimination also pervades every aspect of the criminal law and detention system. Conducting a search of a settler requires a warrant or meeting very restrictive conditions, none of which apply to searching a West Bank Palestinian.[[257]] Israeli law requires detainees be bought before a judge within 24 hours—although that period can be extended to 48 hours in exceptional cases and up to 96 hours when authorized in extraordinary cases—while military law permits holding Palestinians for up to eight days before they must see a judge—and in their case a military judge.[[258]] Authorities can renew detention for longer periods and have a much wider latitude to keep Palestinians in pretrial detention or during proceedings, compared to the standards applicable to Israeli civilians, including settlers.[[259]] Authorities can also deny Palestinians access to counsel for twice as long as to settlers—up to 96 hours for regular offenses and 60 days for “security offenses,” as compared to 48 hours and 21 days for settlers.[[260]] \nThe laws governing children in detention also discriminate between Israelis and West Bank Palestinians. Israeli civil law protects children against nighttime arrests, provides the right to have a parent present during interrogations, and limits the amount of time children may be detained before being able to consult a lawyer and to be presented before a justice.[[261]] In law and in practice, Palestinian children in the West Bank enjoy far fewer protections—Israeli forces regularly arrest children during nighttime raids, interrogate them without a guardian present, and hold those as young as 12 in lengthy pretrial detention.[[262]] ACRI found in 2017, based on government data from 2015, that authorities kept 72 percent of Palestinian children from the West Bank in custody until the end of proceedings, but only 17.9 percent of children in Israel.[[263]] \n[![202104mena_israelpalestine_bornunequal_westbank] \nClick to expand Image\n] \nIsraeli authorities have incarcerated hundreds of thousands of Palestinians for what it deems “security offenses” since 1967,[[264]] including hundreds at virtually any given time held in administrative detention based on secret evidence without charge or trial for renewable periods that can extend for multiple years.[[265]] As of April 2021, according to the Israeli Prison Services, authorities held 4,323 Palestinians from the West Bank, not including East Jerusalem, in custody for “security offenses,” including 426 in administrative detention.[[266]] Israel jails most Palestinian prisoners from the OPT inside Israel, even thoughtransferring residentsfrom occupied territory violates international humanitarian law, and complicates the process of family visits to them.[[267]] By contrast, Israeli authorities, as of March 1, 2021, held no Jewish Israelis for “security offenses” and, over nearly 54 years of occupation, have held not more than a handful of Jewish Israelis in total in administrative detention.[[268]] \nIsraeli authorities have for decades mistreated and tortured Palestinian detainees, using tactics rarely utilized against Jewish detainees.[[269]] A September 1999 Israeli Supreme Court ruling forbidding several torture tactics led to a significant reduction in the number of people tortured, but has not stopped the practice.[[270]] About 1,300 complaints of torture against Israeli authorities have been filed with Israel’s Justice Ministry between 2001 and June 2020, which have resulted in one criminal investigation and zero prosecutions.[[271]] The Israeli rights group Public Committee Against Torture (PCATI) reported in June 2019 that, of the more than 100 complaints of alleged torture it filed over the last five years at the hands of Israel’s internal security service, Shin Bet, 31 percent involved physical violence, 40 percent painful and prolonged shackling or use of stress positions, 66 percent sleep deprivation, 61 percent threats, and 27 percent sexual harassment and humiliation.[[272]] Security forces also routinely use unnecessary force against children during arrests, which often take place in the middle of the night, and physically abuse them in custody.[[273]] \nSecurity forces also frequently raid populated Palestinian areas in the West Bank, even Area A, where Israeli authorities ostensibly charged the PA with fully managing civil and security affairs. Israeli forces routinely useexcessive force, including live ammunition,against Palestinian demonstrators, rock-throwers, suspected assailants, and others in policing situations when lesser means could have been deployed.[[274]] Between January 19, 2009, and January 31, 2021, Israeli security forces killed 449 Palestinians in the West Bank, according to B’Tselem.[[275]] Many thousands more have been grievously wounded.[[276]] \nSettlers, meanwhile, enjoy virtual impunity for criminal acts against Palestinians. Between 2005 and 2019, police closed 91 percent of the complaints tracked by the Israeli human rights group Yesh Din of reported settler violence against Palestinian persons and property without indicting anyone.[[277]] The army not only systematically fails to intervene, but, B’Tselem found, “they often provide the perpetrators escort and back-up. In some cases, they even join in on the attack.”[[278]] \n#### Land and Housing\nSince 1967 Israeli authorities have confiscated more than two million dunams of Palestinian land in the West Bank, often to establish settlements and serve the needs of Jewish Israeli settlers. Israeli authorities have used several different legal instruments to confiscate land—as detailed in a later chapter of this report—among them designating land, including land privately owned by Palestinians, as “state land.”[[279]] \nIsraeli authorities have allocated 674,459 dunams of state land in the West Bank for Israeli civilian use, primarily settlements, according to figures from the Israeli Civil Administration obtained by Peace Now in June 2018.[[280]] This figure comprises 99.76 percent of the total state land that Israeli authorities have officially allocated for use by third parties. The remaining 0.24 percent, or about 1,600 dunams, went to Palestinians. Of this tiny fraction, 80 percent constituted “compensation” for lands taken for settlements and alternative land allocated after the forcible transfer of Palestinian Bedouins from the land on which they had lived. Authorities allocated the majority of this state land, 400,000 dunams in total, to the World Zionist Organization (WZO), according to data provided to the groups ACRI and Bimkom in March 2013.[[281]] The WZO’s Settlement Division defines its mission as to “establish and strengthen Jewish settlement in the country’s periphery through strengthening the hold on state lands given to it by the government.”[[282]] \nIsraeli authorities have made it virtually impossible for Palestinians to obtain building permits in Area C, the 60 percent of the West Bank under exclusive Israeli control.[[283]] For the 20-year period between 2000 and 2019, Israeli authorities approved only 245 building permits for Palestinians in Area C, less than 4 percent of the number of applications submitted. They issued 21 permits between 2016 and 2018, less than 1.5 percent of the applications submitted.[[284]] Between 2009 and 2020, Israeli authorities demolished 5,817 Palestinian-owned structures, including homes, in the West Bank, mostly for lacking a permit, according to the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).[[285]] B’Tselem documented 1,533 Palestinian homes demolished by authorities in this period for lacking a permit, leaving 6,492 Palestinians displaced.[[286]] By contrast, Israeli authorities offer a range of incentives, including housing benefits, business subsidies (particularly in agriculture and industrial zones), budgetary perks, and tax breaks to encourage Jewish Israelis to move to settlements.[[287]] ****In doing so, they have steadily and unlawfully expanded Israeli settlements in the West Bank for decades. According to Peace Now, between 2009 and 2020, Israeli authorities began construction on more than 23,696units in West Bank settlements, excluding East Jerusalem.[[288]] \nThe World Bank estimated in 2013 that discriminatory Israeli restrictions in Area C cost the Palestinian economy $3.4 billion per year.[[289]] \n#### Resources and Services\nIsraeli authorities retain primary control over resources and infrastructure and systematically privilege Jewish Israeli settlers over Palestinians in the provision of roads, water, electricity, health care, and other services. Even where Palestinians maintain a degree of autonomy within their enclaves, they rely on infrastructure projects, including roads, electricity towers, and water and sewage pipes that require Israeli-issued permits or that cross through Israeli-controlled Area C.\nIsraeli authorities built the main network of roads in the West Bank, often at considerable expense and on land expropriated from Palestinians, to bypass Palestinian populated areas and connect settlements to the Israeli road network, to other settlements, and to major metropolitan areas inside Israel.[[290]] According to B’Tselem, there are more than 40 kilometers of West Bank roads that authorities prohibit Palestinians from traveling on and another 19 kilometers of West Bank roads, not including in Hebron, on which Palestinian travel is restricted.[[291]] Israeli forces in Hebron prohibit Palestinians from walking on large sections of what used to be the central thoroughfare of the city as part of a policy of making those areas “sterile” of Palestinians, as per the parlance of the Israeli army.[[292]] \nTo facilitate Palestinian travel between enclaves without using the bypass roads favored by settlers, Israeli authorities established a rudimentary secondary road network for Palestinians. These “fabric of life roads,” as the Israeli army refers to them, generally run alongside and underneath the “bypass roads” used by Israelis.[[293]] With gates at the entrances and exits to Palestinian enclaves, authorities can, at will, shut down the network and cut off traffic between different parts of the West Bank, creating what OCHA calls “an adaptable system of control.”[[294]] \nIsraeli authorities, for example, built in the 1980s a significant segment of Road 443 in the West Bank, in part on expropriated Palestinian land, to offer an alternative route for Israelis to commute between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.[[295]] Some landowners challenged the confiscation, but the Supreme Court dismissed their petition, accepting the government’s position that it built the road, which also historically connected Ramallah to villages to its west, partly to serve the local Palestinian population.[[296]] In 2002, following attacks by Palestinians on Israeli vehicles during the second*Intifada*, Israeli authorities banned Palestinian vehicles from using the road for any purpose, with the then local Israeli army commander declaring, “I made Route 443 an Israelis-only road.”[[297]] In 2007 and 2008, they built “fabric of life” roads to make it easier for Palestinians to access Ramallah without using Road 443. After years of litigation by Israeli rights groups, the Israeli army in 2010 reopened the road to Palestinian traffic.\nHowever, the army kept in place checkpoints at each of the junctions that provide access to Palestinian villages. They also maintained a checkpoint near Ofer prison, where soldiers turn back all Palestinians not holding permits heading eastbound, who are identifiable by West Bank license plates. This checkpoint prevents them from reaching an exit several hundred meters away that leads straight into Ramallah, a central hub for Palestinians in the West Bank.[[298]] So while Palestinian drivers from the West Bank can formally use a large section of Road 443, the checkpoints, by blocking access to Ramallah, render the road useless for most Palestinians. Palestinians from the villages near Road 443 instead rely on the “fabric of life” roads on which it takes them much longer to reach Ramallah or any destination beyond the several other small villages located alongside the road.\nIsraeli authorities also maintain primary control over water resources in the West Bank and allocate water in a discriminatory fashion to Palestinians. Two of Israel’s three major water resources run largely through the West Bank: the Jordan River and the Mountain Aquifer, which consists of three basins. The third, the Coastal Aquifer, runs along the coast of Israel and Gaza.[[299]] Military orders established in the first 18 months of the occupation in 1967 and 1968 granted the army full authority over water-related issues in the West Bank,[[300]] declared water resources state property,[[301]] and barred Palestinians from establishing or using water installations without a permit.[[302]] In 1982, Israeli authorities transferred ownership of water resources and supply from the Civil Administration to the national Israeli water company, Mekorot, while continuing to vest the Civil Administration with regulatory control.[[303]] \nIsrael has used its control over parts of the Mountain Aquifer in the West Bank to serve its own citizens and settlers, in contravention of international humanitarian law which prohibits occupiers from exploiting natural resources for its own economic benefit. While 80 percent of the Mountain Aquifer’s water recharge area lies beneath the West Bank,[[304]] Israel directly extracts about 90 percent of the water that is withdrawn from the aquifer annually, leaving Palestinians only the remaining 10 percent or so to exploit directly.[[305]] In monopolizing this shared resource, Israeli authorities sharply restrict the ability of Palestinians to directly exploit their own natural resources and render them dependent on Israel for their water supply. For decades, authorities have denied Palestinians permits to drill new wells, in particular in the most productive Western Aquifer basins, or to rehabilitate existing ones. While the Oslo Accords of 1995 included provisions that promised to increase Palestinian access to water,[[306]] Palestinian extraction levels have largely remained at pre-Oslo levels while the population has increased.[[307]] \nDespite the establishment of a “Joint Water Commission” (JWC) as part of the Oslo Accords, the World Bank in 2009 noted that Israel has retained “virtually all the power,” including veto power, over the West Bank’s water resources.[[308]] While approving virtually all requests for Israeli-proposed projects to serve settlers, the JWC has rejected many Palestinian-initiated projects, including all requests to drill in the Western Aquifer Basin.[[309]] Israelis are often permitted to drill deeper into the Aquifer, regularly develop internal settlement water networks without seeking JWC approval,[[310]] and can extract water without limit when it flows downstream into Israel without need for JWC approval, while Palestinians face strict extraction quotas.[[311]] The JWC did not meet between 2010 and 2016; during this period, according to government data received by ACRI, Israeli authorities permitted Palestinians to build two new water wells, while demolishing 11.[[312]] \nIn addition, Israeli authorities have almost entirely deprived Palestinians access to water from the Jordan River, the only major surface water resource in the West Bank, by diverting its flow upstream of the West Bank.[[313]] \nIsraeli policies in Area C further restrict Palestinian water access. The separation barrier, for example, separates Palestinians from more than 20 wells in the “seam zone,” between the barrier and the Green Line, limiting their ability to use these water sources, as well as cutting them off from about 70 percent of the Western Aquifer Basin.[[314]] Authorities have also denied permits for Palestinians to build water pipelines and demolished water infrastructure built without permits.[[315]] Between 2009 and July 2019, Israeli authorities demolished or seized 547 structures providing water and related sanitation services, including cisterns, water pipes, and mobile latrines, according to OCHA.[[316]] \nThese restrictions have made Palestinians dependent on purchasing water, in large part extracted from under their land, from Mekorot. A 2013 UN Fact-Finding report found that Mekorot supplies “almost half the water consumed by Palestinian communities” in the West Bank.[[317]] Palestinians in many cases pay more for water than Israelis, at times deriving from mark-ups in the price of the water sold to them, and in particular more than settlers, for whom the WZO subsidizes purchases.[[318]] In addition, many Palestinian communities in Area C are not connected to the water network, despite Mekorot pipes in some cases running nearby, and depend on water transported by tanker trucks, significantly increasing its price and leading some families to spend up to 40 percent of their income on water.[[319]] \nIsrael’s discriminatory water policies in the West Bank enable settlers to enjoy bountiful water, while some Palestinian communities lack sufficient water to provide for their basic needs. In 2017, Amnesty International documented how Israel’s drilling in the Jordan Valley and prevention of local Palestinians from accessing some of their traditional water sources had reduced the supply of water available to them. These restrictions, among other factors, led some farmers to switch to crops that “are less water-intensive and also less profitable” or even to abandon growing crops themselves, with some going to work in nearby settlement farms with more plentiful water supply.[[320]] The World Bank in 2009 found that Israelis as a whole consume four times more water than Palestinians in the West Bank.[[321]] Estimates indicate that settlers in the West Bank on average use at least four times per capita the amount used by Palestinians living in the same territory.[[322]] \n#### Case Study: Salfit Governorate\n*The following case study details how Israeli authorities use oppressive means for the purpose of establishing domination over the Palestinian governorate of Salfit in the West Bank, abusing the rights of its residents to benefit Jewish Israeli settlers living nearby.*\nSalfit is one of eleven Palestinian governorates in the West Bank. It has a population of 81,162 and encompasses a cluster of hilltops and valleys in the northwest West Bank.[[323]] Salfit’s fertile lands, location atop the West Bank basin with the greatest water reserves, high elevation, and proximity to Tel Aviv, a 30-minute drive away, has made the governorate a strategic target for settlement activity.[[324]] Israeli authorities have seized significant parts of the land, building a cluster of settlements centered around the urban settlement of Ariel. The settlements form a 22-kilometer corridor that strikes a wedge in the center of the governorate, dividing Salfit’s Palestinians into three disconnected pockets of villages, and separating the town of Salfit, the governorate’s administrative and commercial center, from other villages to the north.[[325]] Residents of these communities face regular land confiscations, restricted access to agricultural land, movement restrictions, settler violence, and sewage run-offs from the nearby settlements.\nIsraeli settlements form a 22-kilometer corridor that creates a wedge through the center of the Palestinian governorate of Salfit in the occupied West Bank. ©2018 UN OCHA\nThe cluster of settlements grew out of a 1977 Israeli government plan formulated by Ariel Sharon, then agriculture minister and chairperson of the Ministerial Committee for Settlement Affairs, to fortify Israeli control in the western West Bank. As former Israeli official and analyst Shaul Arieli put it, the plan, in particular, sought to, “create a Jewish barrier” between Palestinian population centers and “control key hilltops overlooking the coastal plain [inside Israel].”[[326]] \nA 1997 plan by the WZO’s Settlement Division highlights the “attractiveness” of this area, which it refers to as “western Samaria,” “as a residential area for people who are employed in the center of the country.”[[327]] Noting its “close proximity to centers of employment, services, and the existing culture of the coastal plain,” it describes how it offers a “valve” to “release the urban pressures of the coastal plain.”[[328]] \nThe plan also describes the strategic value of the road network it calls the “Trans-Samaria corridor.” The corridor consists primarily of Highway 5, which starts in northern Tel Aviv and runs east across the Green Line to Ariel, where it meets Road 505, which continues east, crossing the main central north-south artery, Road 60, and continuing to Road 90, which runs north-south through the Jordan Valley. The plan justifies the need for ‘lateral corridors’ like this in the West Bank to “prevent uncontrolled Arab building that is liable to cause the coastal plain to be cut off from the Jordan Valley and the fragmenting of Israeli settlement zones in Judea and Samaria.”[[329]] While Israeli settlers commute daily from Ariel to inside Israel without facing any major checkpoints, authorities have rendered a four-kilometer segment of the highway off-limits to Palestinian vehicles, according to B’Tselem.[[330]] \nThe cluster of settlements also lies above the most productive section of the Mountain Aquifer, the Western Aquifer Basin.[[331]] Israeli authorities though have effectively blocked Palestinians in Salfit from extracting water from the Aquifer, creating a water deficit in the governorate. With few other options, the Salfit governate purchases the vast majority of its water from Mekorot.[[332]] \nTwenty-four largely contiguous Israeli settlements and settlement zones, more than the number of Palestinian communities there, sprawl across the hilltops of the governorate.[[333]] Ariel, one of the more populous settlements in the West Bank with a population of 20,500,[[334]] lies at the eastern edge of the cluster of settlements. The settlement, established in 1978 and with a municipal area (11,600 dunams) more than three times the size of its build-up area (3,500 dunams),[[335]] describes itself on its municipal website as a “blossoming city” that is “located in the heart of Israel.”[[336]] Palestinians in the West Bank can only enter Ariel, including Ariel University, which has about 16,000 students, roughly 3,000 of whom reside there,[[337]] with a difficult-to-obtain permit from the army.[[338]] \nIsraeli authorities have built three fences around Ariel since its establishment, in each case expanding the areas enclosed: the first in the 1980s, a second in 1993, and most recently the separation barrier in 2004. Israel confiscated some private land to build the barriers and, in other cases, effectively fenced off thousands more dunams from their Palestinian owners, who are now subject to a complex set of administrative restrictions on accessing their land. In 2004, the separation barrier around Ariel separated Palestinians in Salfit from 9,000 dunams (900 hectares) of their land –3,500 dunams (350 hectares) belong to more than 200 farmers from Salfit, with the remainder belonging to residents from the nearby villages of Haris, Kifl Haris, Iskaka, Marda, and Qira.[[339]] \n[![An aerial satellite image comparing Marda and Salfit] \nClick to expand Image\n] \nThe Israeli settlement of Ariel between the Palestinian village of Marda (below) and Salfit (above) in the occupied West Bank.Satellite Image ©2021 Maxar Technologies. Source: Google Earth\nHuman Rights Watch in 2014 and 2015 interviewed fourteen farmers from Salfit and the village of Marda, just north of Ariel, who own land that Israeli authorities either confiscated or restricted their access to in order to build settlements or fences or as a result of their construction. The farmers who maintained ownership of their land can access it only with prior permission of the Israeli army, which often only permits them to do so two or three times a year for a limited number of days. In each case, the farmers described how Israeli restrictions, including how often they could cultivate the land and what equipment they could use, drastically reduced the productivity of their harvest and even limited what crops they could grow. Two farmers stopped cultivating all or part of their land altogether, despite their fears that Israel may designate it as state land on the basis that Palestinians have not continuously cultivated it.”[[340]] \nA farmer from the village of Marda told Human Rights Watch in 2015 that his father owned more than 1,000 dunams, but he lost almost all of it over the years to Ariel. “They took it little by little,” he said. “In the beginning [in 1978 and 1979], they took 100 dunams and put caravans there. In the 1980s, they put a barbed wire fence around more land; they didn’t confiscate the land but declared it a closed military zone. Then they started building on it. Each time they would move the fence [to encompass more land], they would say it’s for security reasons.” The farmer said he filed a complaint each time to an Israeli military court, producing all the required evidence of ownership, yet he lost each of the cases. At the time, he said, only 60 dunams remained, 30 of which are behind the separation barrier built in 2004, and which the Israeli army only allows him access to twice a year.[[341]] \nNorthwest of the cluster of settlements around Ariel, the Palestinian village of Mas-ha has faced regular land confiscations since the 1970s. In 1978, the Israeli army seized land in Mas-ha for “military purposes.”[[342]] In subsequent years, they declared lands around Mas-ha “state land” and allocated it to establish the settlement of Elkana in large part on agricultural lands belonging to Mas-ha residents.[[343]] In 2002, authorities expropriated more land to build the separation barrier, cutting residents from some of their land. In 2018, Human Rights Watch interviewed the Aamer family, Mas-ha residents who own about 400-500 dunams of land about two kilometers from their house, but now located beyond the barrier and inside Elkana. A family member said that authorities confiscated some of their land and that they now need permits to access the remainder of it. The permits only allow them to enter through a designated gate that only opens twice a day, for 15-30 minutes each time. Reaching their land via the gate involves a two hour and 20 kilometer detour.[[344]] \nSettlements wreak havoc on the daily life of residents in other ways. Two landowners from Bruqin, a village in an isolated pocket south of the cluster of settlements, told Human Rights Watch that soldiers have for the past 20 years blocked residents from accessing 100 dunams of land they own next to the settlement of Bruchin, southwest of Ariel.[[345]] Settlers have also placed mobile caravans on the land. One of the landowners, 60-year-old farmer Jamal Salameh, said he has since 2017 regularly sought, in vain, the Civil Administration’s assistance to access this plot of land, where he has a well and used to grow wheat and barley.[[346]] \nSalameh owns another small plot of land on the other side of Bruchin that he said settlers have attacked on multiple occasions, including in 2011 when they torched hundreds of olive trees that he planted in 1986, and at least four times in March and April 2020 amid the significant movement restrictions associated with the Covid-19 pandemic. “The army has handed the reins to the settlers. I haven’t seen the army in this area for the past two years,” he said, noting that other landowners from Bruqin have stopped even trying to access their land in this area due to the frequent settler attacks. He also recounted a 2016 incident where he said Mekorot cut down scores of his olive trees without prior notice, to build water pipes to serve the settlements.[[347]] \nIn the nearby village of Kufr ad-Dik, Fares ad-Dik and his family own a 4.5 dunam plot of land, which includes the archaeological site of Deir Samaan, that the settlements of Leshem and Alei Zahav gradually came to surround on three sides. In 2011, Israeli authorities closed the agricultural road that led to his plot of land without notice or explanation, he said. He told Human Rights Watch that the army permitted him to build another one at his own expense, but a year after he had done so at significant expense, they sealed off the new road with a gate.[[348]] This forces him to park his car on the main road and walk uphill 700 meters to reach his plot of land. Settlers also regularly trespass onto his land to swim in natural pools located there, during which time he said his family must “stay away” to avoid confrontation. In one incident in 2019, he said settlers uprooted 13 of their fig and olive trees.\nAd-Dik owns a second plot of land in the village that before 2010 took him five minutes by car to reach. In 2010, however, authorities began construction of the settlement of Leshem under the guise of expanding the nearby settlement of Alei Zahav,[[349]] which blocked the road to his land. Now he said reaching his land involves driving through two nearby villages and walking through a valley where sewage from nearby settlements flow, a journey that takes more than an hour. Due to the difficulty and length of the journey, he said his 70-year-old mother has not visited the property in seven years and he himself only goes once or twice a year. He added that, without being able to transport equipment, he has not been able to plant anything new there. The sewage, he said, leaves his property “surrounded by sewage” from three directions.[[350]] \nAcross the governorate, raw sewage and untreated industrial chemical waste from settlements and industrial zones flows into residential areas and around water sources, two municipal officials and two residents told Human Rights Watch.[[351]] In a 2009 report, B’Tselem documented how Ariel’s wastewater had since the mid-1990s flowed south towards the city of Salfit where it merged with Salfit’s sewage and flows westward into Bruqin and Kufr ad-Dik.[[352]] The group documented how Ariel’s wastewater plant ceased functioning altogether in 2008, after more than a decade of unheeded warnings by Israeli environmental authorities about the plant’s condition.[[353]] It has remained dysfunctional since;[[354]] a 2016 Israeli government publication noted that its efficiency is “low” with “effluent channeled into irrigation and the Shilo river.”[[355]] Salfit has sought for more than two decades to build a wastewater treatment plant, even securing funding for the project, but Israeli authorities continually frustrated their efforts, once claiming the location would be too close to Ariel,[[356]] and another time conditioning approval on agreeing to treat Ariel’s wastewater,[[357]] a condition Palestinians often refuse since it would imply effective recognition of settlements. In 2019, though, the Salfit municipality obtained approval to build a plant to treat its wastewater alone and began construction of the plant in November of that year.[[358]] \nA report published by the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) and the Palestinian Hydrology Group in 2011 said that the Barkan Industrial Area settlement, near Ariel, “is notorious for flushing its leftover chemical waste onto Salfit villages.”[[359]] The report further states that “this chemical waste is thought to include petrochemicals, metals and plastic” and notes that “heavy toxic metals are linked to an endless list of conditions, from diarrhoea to diabetes, hyperkeratosis, organ failure and cancer.”[[360]] During the rainy season, according to B’Tselem, the sewage flows from Ariel downstream into springs and valleys, overflowing Salfit’s central pumping station.[[361]] A Bruqin municipality employee, Murad Samara, told Human Rights Watch that in al-Matwi valley, between Salfit and Bruqin, sewage from Ariel and Salfit flows through a valley where at least 50 families live.[[362]] People in the community worried that exposure to sewage and chemical waste was making people sick. May Barakat, a mother of four who lives in the valley, told Human Rights Watch that “the smell in the valley is deadly” and that her three-year-old daughter was diagnosed with leukemia two years ago. She said that she stopped allowing her children to play outside after one of them fell into the sewage several years prior.[[363]] \nAnother cluster of settlements runs through northern Salfit and juts deep into the neighboring governorate of Qalqilya. The separation barrier entirely encircles the city of Qalqilya, home to more than 55,000 people,[[364]] with only one access road in and out of the city, in order to, according to B’Tselem “create contiguity between Israel” and the settlements there.[[365]] They found that the barrier separates Qalqilya from half of its agricultural lands, about 2,500 dunams.[[366]] \n### East Jerusalem\nAfter seizing the West Bank in 1967, Israel unilaterally annexed 72 square kilometers, including the eastern part of Jerusalem and land that belonged to 28 surrounding West Bank villages, to the Jerusalem municipality. Human Rights Watch is not aware of any other country, with the recent exception of the United States under President Donald Trump, that recognizes Israel’s annexation of East Jerusalem, which remains occupied territory under international law.[[367]] \nAs of September 2020, the Jerusalem municipality includes, according to Israel’s Central Bureau of Statistics, 371,800 Palestinians and 563,200 Jewish Israelis.[[368]] The Jewish Israeli population includes more than 220,000 settlers living in occupied East Jerusalem.[[369]] In the city, Israel effectively maintains one set of rules for Jewish Israelis and another for Palestinians on virtually all aspects of everyday life.\n#### Legal Status\nIsraeli authorities designate Palestinians from East Jerusalem as “permanent residents,” the same status afforded to a foreigner who moves to Israel.[[370]] This precarious status derives from their physical presence in Jerusalem; the Interior Ministry has withdrawn it from at least 14,701 Palestinians since 1967, largely for failing to prove a “center of life” in Jerusalem.[[371]] \nA path to citizenship exists for Palestinian Jerusalemite residents, but the vast majority have chosen not to pursue it, as it recognizes Israel, the occupying power, as the legitimate sovereign. Moreover, the vast majority of those who applied did not receive citizenship.[[372]] As permanent residents, Palestinian Jerusalemites who are not citizens can vote in municipal elections, but not in national Israeli elections.[[373]] \nIn contrast, Jewish Israelis from Jerusalem, including settlers in East Jerusalem, are Israeli citizens and do not have to prove that they maintain connections to the city in order to safeguard their legal status. Israeli authorities have not revoked the legal status of a single Jewish Israeli for failing to prove a “center of life” in Jerusalem. Jewish Israelis living in all parts of Jerusalem also vote in both municipal and national elections.\n[![202104mena_israelpalestine_bornunequal_eastjerusalem] \nClick to expand Image\n] \nWhile Palestinians and Jewish Jerusalemites are subject to the same criminal law, discrimination underlies policing in the city. Across Jerusalem, 77 percent of children arrested in 2018 were Palestinian, although Palestinians constitute less than 40 percent of Jerusalem’s population.[[374]] B’Tselem observed that police violence “is part of Israel’s policy…to ensure Jewish supremacy in the city.”[[375]] For example, Israeli authorities arrested, according to B’Tselem, more than 850 Palestinians, mostly children, many of whom were beaten, from the neighborhood of Issawiya in East Jerusalem between April 2019 and April 2020.[[376]] B’Tselem described these arrests in Issawiya as part of “an ongoing campaign of abuse and collective punishment against its residents,”[[377]] documenting how police forces regularly entered the neighborhood to “initiate ‘friction’… block the narrow streets, fire stun grenades, tear gas and sponge rounds and arrest and beat residents.”[[378]] The Israeli newspaper*Haaretz*, which has reported on near-daily raids, patrols, checkpoints, and ambushes in Issawiya, and described the policy as one of “collective punishment,”[[379]] found that only a “tiny fraction” of those arrested have been charged with stone-throwing or other offenses.[[380]] \nIn addition, the separation barrier cuts through East Jerusalem, separating Palestinian communities in at least three ways. First, it places tens of thousands of Palestinian Jerusalemites living in areas such as Kufr Aqab and the Shuafat refugee camp on the West Bank side of the barrier, separating them from the rest of East Jerusalem.[[381]] Second, the barrier traps some West Bank Palestinians on the Jerusalem side, for example in Nabi Samuel. West Bank Palestinian residents of these areas are effectively forbidden from being anywhere on the Jerusalem side of the barrier outside their homes or communities and must cross a checkpoint to attend school or work or go to the grocery store or hospital.[[382]] Third, the barrier creates various fully encircled enclaves in the West Bank, for example in Bir Nabala, that are connected to other Palestinian communities only by “fabric of life” roads.[[383]] \n#### Land and Housing\nSince 1967 Israeli authorities have expropriated from Palestinians nearly one-third of the land in East Jerusalem, comprising at least 23,378 dunams, largely for settlements.[[384]] As with the rest of the West Bank, Israeli authorities have since 1967 frozen the land registration process for Palestinians in East Jerusalem, while registering land in East Jerusalem settlements throughout the entire period.[[385]] The freeze puts the land of Palestinians who had not registered it by 1967 at risk of confiscation and also makes it difficult for them to obtain building permits. The Israeli rights group Ir Amim estimated in a 2015 report that half the land in East Jerusalem is not registered.[[386]] \nBeyond formal state confiscation, discriminatory laws and policies enable settler and settler organizations to take possession of Palestinian homes, evict the Palestinian landowners, and transfer their property to Jewish owners in East Jerusalem neighborhoods.[[387]] They have done so based on a 1970 law that requires authorities to return to Jewish owners or their heirs property they owned in East Jerusalem prior to 1948 and that was held by Jordanian authorities between 1948 and 1967.[[388]] By contrast, authorities have largely allowed the takeover of the land and homes of Palestinians in West Jerusalem who were expelled or fled as a result of the events of 1947-1949 and of Palestinians who were expelled or fled as a result of the onset of the Israeli occupation in 1967, by declaring it as “absentee property.”[[389]] \nThe Ateret Cohanim settler organization, for example, has filed dozens of eviction lawsuits against around 100 Palestinian families living in the Batn al-Hawa area of Silwan in East Jerusalem, claiming that their homes belonged to a Jewish property trust that had housed Yemeni Jews in the late 19thcentury.[[390]] Ateret Cohanim aims to create a Jewish neighborhood in the heart of Silwan, putting 700 Palestinians at risk of eviction.[[391]] Jerusalem magistrate courts ruled in favor of Ateret Cohanim in several of these suits in 2020, ordering the eviction of families who had lived there for decades.[[392]] In June 2020, a Jerusalem court ruled in favor of the Jewish National Fund (JNF) in an eviction proceeding that the group filed against a family of 18 from a building in Silwan that the family has lived in since the 1950s.[[393]] These decisions have been appealed, and the evictions have not yet been carried out, as of March 2021.[[394]] \nIsraeli authorities have made it virtually impossible for Palestinians to obtain building permits in East Jerusalem, in particular outside built-up neighborhoods that make up less than 15 percent of East Jerusalem and 8.5 percent of the Jerusalem municipality.[[395]] According to Peace Now, “while the government has initiated planning, appropriation of land for construction, tenders for the construction of more than 55,000 housing units for Israelis in East Jerusalem since 1967, the Palestinians have seen government-initiated construction of only 600 housing units (in the 1970s).”[[396]] As a result, most Palestinian construction in East Jerusalem is based on private rather than state initiatives. Municipal planners between 1991 and 2018 approved only 9,536 building permits for Palestinians, while approving 48,201 in Jewish neighborhoods of Jerusalem, including 21,834 in settlements.[[397]] \nBetween 2009 and 2020, Israeli authorities demolished 1,434 structures in East Jerusalem, in more than 98 percent of the cases for lacking a permit, according to OCHA.[[398]] According to B’Tselem, authorities demolished 786 homes in East Jerusalem during this period, leaving 2,561 Palestinians displaced.[[399]] By contrast, Israeli authorities almost never demolish the homes of Jewish Israelis in Jerusalem, even where there are building violations.[[400]] \n#### Resources and Services\nIsraeli authorities sharply discriminate in the provision of resources and services between Palestinians and Jewish Israelis in Jerusalem. While most Palestinian neighborhoods have poor infrastructure and inadequate health, recreation, and educational services and facilities, most predominantly Jewish neighborhoods have well-paved roads, numerous parks and playgrounds, adequate refuse collection, and sufficient places for children in schools.[[401]] In January 2016, the Jerusalem district court ordered the municipality to build more playgrounds in the Palestinian neighborhoods of Shuafat and Beit Hanina, after residents of those neighborhoods alleged that they only had two playgrounds to serve a combined population of 60,000, while nearby Jewish neighborhoods had a playground for every 1,000 residents.[[402]] \nThe Jerusalem municipality in 2013 allocated only 10.1 percent of its municipal budget for projects and spending in Palestinian neighborhoods, according to the Israeli rights group Ir Amim, despite Palestinians making up about 37 percent of the city’s population at the time and paying taxes.[[403]] Ir Amim estimated in 2020 that Palestinians in East Jerusalem faced a shortage of 3,794 classrooms; while some shortages also existed in Jewish communities, in particular Orthodox communities, the group estimated that, by the end of 2022, “the classroom shortage in Jerusalem will be confined to the Arab sector alone.”[[404]] In addition, only 44 percent of Palestinians in East Jerusalem are connected to the water grid “in an orderly and legal manner,” according to ACRI, leaving many residents with limited supply.[[405]] \nThe discriminatory allocation of resources contributes to the starkly different realities faced by Palestinians and Jewish Israelis in Jerusalem. Seventy-two percent of Palestinian families live below the poverty line, as compared to 26 percent of Jewish families.[[406]] Despite this, the Israeli government maintains six welfare offices, or offices that provide information to residents looking to receive government aid or other services, in Palestinian neighborhoods, but 19 in predominantly Jewish neighborhoods.[[407]] Thirty-two percent of Palestinian students in East Jerusalem do not complete 12 years of education, as compared to 1.5 percent of Jewish students in Jerusalem.[[408]] \n#### Case Study: Kufr Aqab\n*The following case study details how Israeli authorities have discriminated against Palestinians living in Kufr Aqab on the outskirts of East Jerusalem mainly through building the separation barrier between it and the rest of the city in 2002 and then largely neglecting the needs of residents. The situation in Kufr Aqab differs from the more common policies and practices that institutionally discriminate against Palestinians of Jerusalem but represents a different method by which an oppressively discriminatory system results in rights abuses for Palestinians living in East Jerusalem.*\nThe separation barrier cuts off Kufr Aqab, a Palestinian town that largely falls at the northernmost edge of the boundaries of the Israeli-demarcated Jerusalem municipality, from the rest of Jerusalem. In the nearly two decades since the erection of the barrier, Israeli authorities have effectively stopped governing in Kufr Aqab, failing to police, regulate construction, or in large part provide services to residents. The neglect and resulting lawlessness have effectively turned Kufr Aqab into a crowded slum and what one Israeli policy institute deemed “a kind of no man’s land.”[[409]] \n[![A concrete wall separates a city and a highway] \nClick to expand Image\n] \nThe Palestinian area Kufr Aqab, which largely falls within the jurisdiction of the Israeli-governed Jerusalem municipality, is effectively cut off from the rest of the city because it lies on the West Bank side of the separation barrier.© 2018 AFP/Getty\nAfter the 1967 war, Israel annexed most of Kufr Aqab, including the then Jerusalem airport and the neighborhoods of Samiramis and Zghayyar that have historically been a part of Kufr Aqab, and incorporated it, along with other West Bank villages and East Jerusalem, into the Jerusalem municipality, apparently to bring the airport under its control.[[410]] Annexation, though, split the town into two parts, with about 40 percent remaining outside the territory that Israel incorporated and today falling within Area C of the West Bank, where Israel maintains full civil and security control.[[411]] Kufr Aqab’s municipal council formally serves the part of the town outside Jerusalem’s municipal boundaries, but, in practice, also engages residents in the Jerusalem part. Neither Israeli nor Palestinian authorities maintain precise population figures for Kufr Aqab; estimates range between 70,000 and 100,000,[[412]] while Kufr Aqab’s municipal council maintains that the actual figure is around 120,000.[[413]] \nIn the 1980s, Israeli authorities confiscated 1,415 dunams from Kufr Aqab as state land and allocated it to establish the settlement of Kochav Ya’akov, according to B’Tselem.[[414]] An official from the municipal council estimates that Kufr Aqab lost in total about a third of its land to Kochav Ya’akov.[[415]] In August 2009, settlers erected 12 structures on additional Kufr Aqab land that was privately owned by its residents. When the council head petitioned the Israeli Supreme Court to halt construction, the Israeli army declared the area a closed military zone, although it allowed settlers to remain, and several years later declared 224 dunams as state land, according to the Israeli rights group Yesh Din.[[416]] The Supreme Court in November 2020 rejected the residents’ claim of land ownership and thereby their challenge to the state land designation.[[417]] In February 2020, Israel’s Housing Ministry advanced a plan to build a settlement in the area where the Jerusalem airport once stood.[[418]] \nIn 2002, Israeli authorities, citing security reasons, built in the Jerusalem area a segment of the separation barrier more than 200 kilometers long. The Israeli rights group Ir Amim noted that its route “adds to Jerusalem the Jewish population that lives in the settlement blocs outside of the city’s municipal area[,] in addition to a very large area of land outside them,” while it “subtracts the Palestinian population that lives in those areas from Jerusalem.”[[419]] Running between Kufr Aqab and the strip where the airport once was, in part on Kufr Aqab’s land, the barrier separates residents from Jerusalem and over 500 dunams of the town’s own agricultural lands, according to Kufr Aqab municipal council officials.[[420]] The barrier runs south to the Qalandiya checkpoint, the main crossing between Ramallah and Jerusalem, which Kufr Aqab residents, the majority of whom hold Jerusalem IDs, must cross to reach the rest of Jerusalem. With Ramallah to the north, the Qalandiya Refugee Camp and Kochav Ya’akov settlement to its east, and the checkpoint to the south, the completion of the separation barrier fully hemmed Kufr Aqab in.[[421]] \n[![Satellite graphic of Kufr Aqab] \nClick to expand Image\n] \nKufr Aqab, a Palestinian area on the northernmost edge of the boundaries of the Israeli-demarcated Jerusalem municipality, is hemmed in, by: to the west by, the separation barrier; to the south, the Qalandiya checkpoint that separates the cities of Ramallah and Jerusalem; to the east, Qalandiya Refugee Camp and the settlement of Kochav Ya’akov, built in part on Kufr Aqab land; and to the north, Ramallah.© Satellite image courtesy of Planet Labs Inc. 2021\nBeyond physically separating Palestinians from one another, the building of the barrier coincided with the Israeli government’s effective abandonment of governance and law enforcement over Kufr Aqab. Israeli authorities do not operate a police station in Kufr Aqab,[[422]] and, as acknowledged in a 2008 State Comptroller report, maintain “no police operations to enforce or maintain order” there.[[423]] Munir Zghayyar, chair of the Kufr Aqab Residents Committee, told Human Rights Watch that he is not aware of a single incident of Israeli police entering Kufr Aqab since 2001 and that, even when residents cross the checkpoint and go in-person to a police station, authorities often do not intervene.[[424]] The army, charged since 2006 with responsibility for security in Kufr Aqab, at times enters Kufr Aqab to carry out security operations and arrests, even though it defines the area as falling within Israel’s sovereign territory and thus not under military rule.[[425]] \nWith the PA barred under the Oslo Accords from operating in Kufr Aqab, these policies create what OCHA has called “a security vacuum manifested in an increase in lawlessness, crime and drug trafficking,”[[426]] and offer fertile ground for fugitives from the PA police.[[427]] Three Kufr Aqab residents told Human Rights Watch that they regularly hear gunfire, so much so that one resident’s family grew “afraid to go on the balcony.”[[428]] Another said, “I am always afraid—anything can happen and who am I supposed to turn to when it does?”[[429]] In the absence of law enforcement, Zghayyar, the Residents Committee chair, said some of the larger families living there have taken it upon themselves to adjudicate disputes.[[430]] \nIsraeli authorities have also since the building of the barrier effectively stopped regulating construction. Municipal authorities approved a plan for Kufr Aqab in 2005, but Ir Amim found that it was “no longer current” even then.[[431]] Zghayyar and an official from the municipal council both told Human Rights Watch that authorities have not issued a building permit for the area since 2001.[[432]] Moien Odeh, a lawyer who has brought cases on behalf of Kufr Aqab and a former resident, said that residents used to have to get a difficult-to-obtain permit to “build anything,” but, following the outbreak of the second*Intifada*and the building of the barrier, authorities suggested off-hand to some contractors and residents that they did not need a permit and residents eventually stopped applying.[[433]] Ir Amim quoted the director of the municipality’s building inspection division in a June 2015 report as acknowledging that the municipality is not monitoring or enforcing construction there.[[434]] Ir Amim also determined that the division had not entered Kufr Aqab in a decade.[[435]] \nThe lack of regulation in Kufr Aqab stands in sharp contrast to the government’s policy of sharply restricting building in other Palestinian neighborhoods in East Jerusalem and carrying out thousands of home demolitions since 1967.[[436]] Amid the housing crunch and difficulty of building in Palestinian neighborhoods inside the separation barrier, many Palestinian Jerusalemites have moved to Kufr Aqab, where, according to Zghayyar, property costs one-third less.[[437]] \nKufr Aqab has since the building of the barrier attracted Jerusalemites married to Palestinians from other parts of the West Bank, who under Israel’s Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law (Temporary Order)—2003 cannot obtain permanent status through marriage to a Jerusalem resident.[[438]] Since Kufr Aqab falls within the Jerusalem municipality, Jerusalemites living there can claim that they live in the city and not lose their residency on that basis. Scores of Palestinians have since 1967moved to other parts of the West Bank.[[439]] At the same time, its location beyond the barrier and lack of law enforcement means that West Bank residents can live there without crossing an Israeli checkpoint.\nBecause of Israel’s discriminatory system, Palestinian “mixed” couples from Jerusalem and the West Bank can with few exceptions live together legally on a long-term, secure basis only in neighborhoods like Kufr Aqab. By contrast, Jewish “mixed” couples, including Jerusalemites married to West Bank settlers, can freely live anywhere in Israel, East Jerusalem, and the West Bank settlements.\nA Palestinian woman said she lived for four years in a Jerusalem neighborhood inside the separation barrier apart from her husband, who is from Hebron and has been unable to get permits to enter Jerusalem. During this time, she had to raise their three children alone, in order to maintain a “center of life” in the city and thereby her residency.[[440]] When she learned that she could both do that and live with her husband in Kufr Aqab, she said they moved there in 2006 and they have remained since. Her daughter, though, continued to attend school across the barrier, crossing the Qalandiya checkpoint daily. She said her family did not wish to remain in Kufr Aqab, citing the difficulty of life there, but had no other options.\nHigh demand and lack of regulation in Kufr Aqab have driven a “rapid and informal increase in residential construction, particularly high-rise buildings.”[[441]] Built without properly vetted plans or oversight, and often within meters of each other, many buildings rise 10-12 stories high, lack adequate infrastructure for “water, drainage, sewage, electricity and roads,” and appear not to meet basic safety standards.[[442]] Odeh, the lawyer, adds that this sort of construction creates a reality where no one knows the boundaries between parcels, and trespassing is common.[[443]] Multi-story buildings, about 90 percent built without a permit, according to a municipal council employee involved in inspections,[[444]] have been constructed on land reaching up the barrier, taking up virtually all the area available for public spaces, and contributing to population density.[[445]] An official from the municipal council observed that the only place left to build is “towards the sky.”[[446]] \nAlthough Jerusalemites living in Kufr Aqab pay the same municipal taxes as those living in other Jerusalem neighborhoods, “public infrastructure, resources and services are significantly degraded or lacking entirely.”[[447]] In February 2015, the municipality’s deputy legal advisor acknowledged to Ir Amim that “the Municipality encounters difficulties” servicing Kufr Aqab.[[448]] Kufr Aqab has no government buildings beyond an Interior Ministry office at the Qalandiya checkpoint, and no emergency health or fire, banking, or welfare services.[[449]] As a result, residents generally have to cross Qalandiya checkpoint, where waits often take an hour or more to access most municipal services. According to Zghayyar, the Residents Committee Chair, about 3,800 children also cross the checkpoint on schooldays to attend class on the other side of the wall, given the relatively few schools built inside Kufr Aqab.[[450]] Israel’s national emergency service, Magen David Adom, generally does not service areas beyond the barrier like Kufr Aqab,[[451]] so, for residents to reach a Jerusalem hospital by ambulance, they must take a Palestinian ambulance to the checkpoint and transfer there to a Magen David Adom ambulance that can take them to one.[[452]] \nIn 2006 the Israeli government established the Jerusalem Envelope Administration (JEA) to oversee communities within the Jerusalem municipality but beyond the separation barrier, mainly Kufr Aqab and the Shuafat refugee camp, in addition to several smaller communities.[[453]] UN OCHA estimated in 2016 that about 160,000 Palestinians live in these areas.[[454]] According to Ir Amim, these areas receive only a fraction of the budget allocated to other Jerusalem neighborhoods.[[455]] The group said that the JEA has “effectively served to distance residents from the Municipality,” which often refers residents to the JEA. The JEA, in turn, often informs them that they do not have the funding to implement necessary projects.[[456]] The former head of the JEA acknowledged to Ir Amim the government’s “neglect,” as he put it, of these areas and has spoken of the “lawlessness” there, noting that “there is no government presence in [Kufr Aqab] for the purposes of public order.”[[457]] Ir Amim noted one exception to the neglect of the area: private investigators hired by the government to verify that residents actually live there for the purposes of probing their residency status.[[458]] \nEven when the municipality provides services, it largely fails to meet the needs of residents. The municipality, for example, contracts the task of garbage collection to a private company but based on an underestimate of the number of residents the company is to serve.[[459]] A lawsuit filed by Kufr Aqab residents against the municipality alleged that, in 2012, Jerusalem spent about 328 million NIS on garbage collection, but only around 2 million NIS –or less than 1 percent –in Kufr Aqab, despite the portion of Kufr Aqab within the city’s boundaries housing a percentage of the city’s population likely at least six times higher.[[460]] The municipality increased the budget following the suit,[[461]] but Odeh, the lawyer who filed it, said that the collection schedule still does not meet the needs of residents, who often resort to burning their trash.[[462]] \nIr Amim further estimated in 2015 that 10 out of 25 kilometers of roads in Kufr Aqab are unpaved, eight are in “dilapidated condition,” and only four are paved and “in reasonable condition.” Even paved ones, they noted, “lack sidewalks, signage, and pedestrian crossings,” and the “only traffic light in Kufr Aqab is permanently broken.”[[463]] Documents from the municipality cited by Odeh in a petition he filed show that, in 2015, less than 0.02 percent of the municipal budget for roads went to Kufr Aqab and other communities outside the barrier.[[464]] Some roads have been renovated since 2015, but the overall condition of roads remains poor.[[465]] \nThe poor condition of the roads compounds the already heavy traffic in Kufr Aqab, which is bisected by the main road connecting Ramallah with the south West Bank, including cities of Bethlehem, Hebron, and Jerusalem, via the Qalandiya checkpoint. According to a statement by Israeli authorities quoted by Reuters in April 2017, about 26,000 people cross the Qalandiya checkpoint daily.[[466]] Due to consistently heavy traffic, it can take up to two or three hours during morning and evening commutes to pass through the area around the checkpoint.[[467]] \nPoor infrastructure, in particular, a run-down water pipeline system, also causes residents to lose about one-fourth of the water supplied to it.[[468]] While Mekorot, the national water company, supplies water to most neighborhoods in Jerusalem, including settlements, the Palestinian-run Jerusalem Water Undertaking, which operates in Ramallah and nearby areas, services Kufr Aqab, as it did before 1967, and struggles to meet the demands of residents.[[469]] \nJerusalem’s mayor, Moshe Lion, visited Kufr Aqab, reportedly for the first time, in February 2021 and said the municipality will “increase its activity and take confidence-building steps.”[[470]] \nLawmakers in 2017 introduced legislation at the Knesset that would separate communities beyond the separation barrier from the Jerusalem municipality and establish a separate local authority to govern them.[[471]] The legislation has not advanced, but residents expressed concern that the law represents the government’s long-term designs for these areas. Authorities have long pursued a policy to box in, separate, and exert pressure on Palestinian Jerusalemites to live beyond the barrier. The draft law threatens to take things one step further, opening the door to removing residents of Kufr Aqab and other areas beyond the barrier from Jerusalem’s demographic calculus altogether to preserve a Jewish majority there.\n### Gaza Strip\nIsraeli authorities have exerted primary control over the Gaza Strip since occupying it in 1967. Israel recognized Gaza as part of a “single territorial unit” with the West Bank in the 1995 Oslo Accords.[[472]] Israel’s withdrawal of its ground troops and settler population in 2005 reduced its day-to-day control and allowed Palestinian authorities to exercise more autonomy within Gaza than they had before. In 2007, Hamas authorities seized power from the Fatah-led PA in Gaza.\nIsraeli authorities, however, have remained in critical ways the supreme power, dominating the coastal strip through other means.[[473]] Israel controls Gaza’s territorial waters and airspace and has blocked the building of an airport and seaport, significantly complicating efforts to travel abroad.[[474]] Israel also controls the movement of people and goods into and out of Gaza, except for at Gaza’s border with Egypt, which the Egyptian government also significantly restricts. Israel controls all transit between Gaza and the West Bank and maintains a “policy of separation” between the two parts of the OPT.[[475]] It controls the Palestinian population registry, which determines eligibility for establishing legal residency and obtaining an ID card.[[476]] It sets the rates for the customs and value-added taxes that it collects on behalf of the PA on goods entering the common market.[[477]] It enforces a so-called “no-go” zone inside Gaza, near Israeli territory.[[478]] It controls the infrastructure upon which Gaza relies, including electricity lines, the underwater cable that phone calls are placed on, the network that provides internet, and the frequencies assigned to Palestinian cell phone companies.[[479]] \nIsraeli authorities impose a generalized closure on the Gaza Strip, exacerbated by Egypt’s restrictions at its border with Gaza. ©2020 UN OCHA\nIn light of these controls that Israel exercises over the lives and welfare of Palestinians in Gaza, Israel remains bound to provide them with the rights and protections afforded to them by the law of occupation, as the ICRC and UN have both determined.[[480]] Israeli authorities have consistently failed to meet their obligations as an occupying power.\nThe Egyptian government often imposes restrictions along its border with Gaza, which exacerbate the impact of Israel’s policies on residents of Gaza, but Egypt’s obligations differ since it is not the occupying power and can, with some key limitations, decide whom to allow to enter its territory.[[481]] \nGiven international consensus around and Israeli recognition of Gaza and the West Bank comprising a single territorial unit, the OPT, Human Rights Watch assesses dynamics in Gaza as part of the OPT, despite Israel’s “separation policy.” Viewed in that light, the severe repression of Palestinians in Gaza stands in marked contrast to the treatment of Israeli settlers in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Israeli authorities deny Palestinians in the OPT, including in Gaza, basic rights and services that they provide Israeli settlers living in the same legal territory, including freedom of movement, the right to live with or visit loved ones living in that territory, and access to 24-hour electricity and clean water.\n#### Legal Status\nPalestinians in Gaza, like those in the West Bank, hold Israeli-issued identity cards and passports that grant them residency in Gaza, but they do not have citizenship or nationality. About 70 percent of Gaza’s nearly 2.1 million residents are refugees forced to flee their homes in what became Israel, or their descendants, who have been denied their right to return to the areas where they or their families once lived.[[482]] Israeli authorities struck from the registry thousands of Palestinians from Gaza who were not present in the territory in 1967 when the occupation began, either because they had fled during the fighting or were already abroad, as well as more than 100,000 between 1967 and 1994 who had been abroad for long periods.[[483]] Palestinians not in the population registry cannot obtain ID cards and thereby enter or exit Gaza through either the Israeli—or Egyptian—controlled crossings.[[484]] By contrast, Israeli settlers in the OPT never risk losing their citizenship, even after having lived abroad for long periods.\nUntil 2005, the Israeli army ruled directly over Gaza, while applying Israeli civil law to the more than 7,500 Jewish settlers who lived there.[[485]] Following the withdrawal of those settlers in 2005 and the takeover by Hamas in 2007, Israel declared Gaza “hostile territory”[[486]] and tightened movement restrictions, imposing a generalized ban on travel to the rest of the OPT or abroad, irrespective of any individualized risk assessment for a particular person. That ban applies to all Palestinians except those whom Israeli authorities deem as presenting “exceptional humanitarian circumstances.”[[487]] This closure, alongside Egyptian restrictions on its border with Gaza, has remained in place since 2007 and has separated families and restricted residents from accessing medical care and educational and economic opportunities.[[488]] By contrast, Israeli settlers in the OPT enjoy freedom of movement across much of the OPT, including to East Jerusalem and West Bank settlements, as well as to Israel and abroad.\nThe shifts that took place between 2005 and 2007 altered the mechanisms but not the fact of Israeli control of the Gaza Strip, nor the systematic oppression of its population. The withdrawal of settlers and regular ground forces from Gaza shifted Israel’s practice from one focused on raids and arrests as in the West Bank to one built on the periodic use of overwhelming military force, often with devastating consequences for the civilian population.\nIn the period since 2007, the Israeli army conducted several large-scale military offensives in Gaza, including in 2008-09, 2012, and 2014, and clashed scores of times with Palestinian armed groups in Gaza. During these confrontations, Israeli forces regularly used excessive and vastly disproportionate force, at times deliberately targeted civilians or civilian infrastructure,[[489]] and, in total, killed well over 2,000 Palestinian civilians.[[490]] \nPalestinian armed groups also committed war crimes, including indiscriminate rocket attacks fired towards Israeli population centers,[[491]] but Israel’s attacks went far beyond striking those responsible. Beyond the thousands killed or maimed, Israeli attacks have destroyed tens of thousands of structures and critical infrastructure, including homes, hospitals, schools, and Gaza’s only power plant, causing considerable harm to civilian life that has lasted for years afterward.[[492]] The 2014 hostilities alone completely destroyed or heavily damaged about 18,000 residential units, leaving more than 100,000 people without a home, according to B’Tselem.[[493]] In July 2019, some 8,200 people remained internally displaced as a result of 2014 hostilities, according to OCHA.[[494]] In January 2019, when campaigning for public office, former Israeli army chief-of-staff and current Alternate Prime Minister and Defense Minister Benjamin (Benny) Gantz said that these attacks “sent [parts of Gaza] back to the Stone Age.”[[495]] Israeli authorities have for years consistently failed to credibly investigate unlawful attacks and to hold those responsible to account.[[496]] \nIsraeli forces stationed on the Israeli side of the fences separating Gaza and Israel responded with excessive lethal force to weekly demonstrations for Palestinian rights on the Gaza side that took place for much of 2018 and 2019.[[497]] Snipers killed, according to OCHA, 214 Palestinian demonstrators, many of them more than one hundred meters away, and injured by live fire more than 8,000 more, including 156 whose limbs had to be amputated.[[498]] As a UN Commission of Inquiry put it, Israeli forces shot at “unarmed protesters, children and disabled persons, and at health workers and journalists performing their duties, knowing who they are.”[[499]] The commissioners concluded that while demonstrations were “at times violent,” protesters did not pose an imminent threat to life in the case of 187 of the 189 killings that took place in 2018, and Israel used “neither necessary nor proportional” force.[[500]] Snipers followed orders from senior officials that sanctioned using live ammunition on Palestinians who approached or attempted to cross or damage fences between Gaza and Israel regardless of whether they posed an imminent threat to life. These practices stem from a decades-long pattern that has changed little since the outbreak of the first Palestinian*Intifada*in 1987 of using excessive force to quell protests and disturbances, at great cost to civilians. Despite the frequency of such incidents over the years, Israeli authorities have failed to develop law enforcement tactics that comport with international human rights norms, which prohibit the use of lethal force except in situations when it is necessary to prevent an imminent threat of death or serious injury.[[501]] Israeli authorities have often justified these tactics in the name of protecting Israeli communities on the other side of the Gaza fence from the possibility of harm,[[502]] but without justifying the force used under the imminent-threat test.\n#### Land and Housing\nIsrael’s closure, alongside restrictions that the Egyptian government often imposes, boxes Gaza’s more than two million residents into a strip of territory that is 41 kilometers long and between 6 and 12 kilometers wide, totaling 365 square kilometers. Gaza’s population density of about 5,453 people per square kilometer is more than 13 times that of Israel’s 400 people per square kilometer.[[503]] \n[![An aerial shot of Gaza] \nClick to expand Image\n] \nWith a population of more than two million Palestinians living in a small territory, Gaza has a population density of about 5,453 people per square kilometer.© 2016 Ain Media\nFurther confining the Palestinians of Gaza, Israeli authorities have established a “buffer zone” inside Gaza, as opposed to on its side of the fences that they have built separating Gaza from Israel. The Israeli army told the Israeli rights group Gisha in August 2015 that it forbids Gaza residents from approaching within 300 meters of the fence, except for those farmers whom it permits to approach within 100 meters of the fence.[[504]] Israeli forces routinely fire on those who enter or approach the “buffer zone.” Between 2010 and 2017, before the wave of protests that began in March 2018, Gisha reported 1,300 incidents of live fire on Gaza residents, which killed 161 Palestinians and injured more than 3,000.[[505]] \nSince 2014, Israeli authorities have also regularly sprayed herbicides along the eastern fences to remove vegetation, it says in order to “enable optimal and continuous security operations.”[[506]] Authorities have also said that the spraying takes place “exclusively” over Israeli territory,[[507]] but the research group Forensic Architecture in January 2020 documented how the westward wind causes herbicide sprayed on the Israeli side of the fences to cause damage in more than 350 meters into Gaza.[[508]] Spraying these sorts of pesticides has caused extensive damage to crops in an area that includes the most arable land in all of Gaza, causing financial loss for farmers,[[509]] and can impair the health of people living in the area.[[510]] \nCiting concerns about weapons smuggling, Israeli authorities also restrict how much of the sea, including Gaza’s territorial waters, residents can access. For years, they generally permitted Palestinians to venture up to six nautical miles off the coast, though subject to frequent fluctuations; for a short period in 2019, they extended the limit to 15 nautical miles, though at other times barred access entirely.[[511]] Israel has not justified these fluctuations in the fishing zone on security grounds, but rather as punitive measures in response to rocket fire or the launching of incendiary balloons by armed Palestinian groups, acts with which fishermen had no involvement.[[512]] Between 2010 and 2017, the Palestinian rights group Al-Mezan documented 976 incidents of live fire at sea, resulting in five deaths and 250 incidents in which Israeli authorities seized boats or other equipment, allegedly for traveling beyond the permissible fishing zone.[[513]] B’Tselem in 2017 found that the number of registered fishermen in Gaza dropped from about 10,000 in 2000 to around 4,000 in 2017, half of whom are out of work and 95 percent of whom live below the poverty line, concluding that Israeli policies, including “harassment of fishermen,” are “destroying Gaza’s fishing sector.”[[514]] \n#### Resources and Services\nDiscriminatory restrictions and burdens imposed by Israeli authorities restrict the entry and exit of goods in and out of Gaza and limit the access of Gazans to basic services, such as electricity and water.\nThe 13-year-old closure sharply restricts the movement of goods. Following Hamas’s takeover in 2007 and Israel’s declaration of Gaza as “hostile territory,”[[515]] Israeli authorities between September 2007 and May 2010 banned most civilian goods from entering Gaza, including coriander, paper, and chocolate.[[516]] Israeli authorities in January 2008 calculated the minimum number of calories per person that Gaza residents needed to avoid malnutrition, although they insist they never implemented a policy based on the calculation.[[517]] Israeli officials said at the time that they wanted to keep Gaza’s economy “on the brink of collapse” while avoiding a humanitarian crisis.[[518]] \nSince 2010, Israeli authorities have allowed most everyday goods to enter, but sharply restrict and often prohibit altogether what they deem “dual-use” items or those that could be used for military purposes, such as for building or fortifying tunnels into Israel.[[519]] The government’s “dual-use” list, though, includes both overly broad categories and items that are vital to meet the needs of Gaza’s population, including “communications equipment,” “steel elements and construction products,” “drilling equipment,” “fertilizers and chemicals,” gas tanks, castor oil, and “vehicles except for personal vehicles (not including 4X4 vehicles).”[[520]] Israeli authorities have also claimed certain kinds of medical equipment, including x-ray equipment, as “dual use,” according to the WHO.[[521]] Gisha has documented how many of these items are “rarely, if ever, allowed into the Strip.”[[522]] OCHA has said that these “restrictions impede the delivery of humanitarian assistance, basic services and reconstruction programs, and undermine the response capacity for emergencies.”[[523]] However, Israeli authorities have maintained them in lieu of alternatives, such as international monitoring of the use of dual-use items. Egypt only began formally allowing goods into Gaza in February 2018, but subject to unclear procedures, including denials of some goods also barred by Israeli authorities and at a volume significantly less than through the Israeli-administered crossing.[[524]] \nAs part of the closure policy, Israeli authorities also sharply restrict the export of goods out of Gaza to the West Bank, Israel, and abroad. Between June 2007 and October 2014, Israeli authorities on average permitted only 14 truckloads of goods to exit per month, according to Gisha.[[525]] The situation has improved somewhat since, with an average of 219 truckloads per month exiting for the four-year period between 2016 and 2019, but that still is just roughly 20 percent of the 1,064 truckloads per month exiting prior to the June 2007 tightening of the closure.[[526]] Egypt does not allow goods from Gaza to be shipped out via the crossing it administers.[[527]] \nIsraeli authorities have acknowledged that their determinations do not turn solely on security. They have, for example, restricted or shut down exports as a punitive measure, which they did for a total of 50 days in 2018 and 2019, according to Gisha.[[528]] In addition, authorities have acknowledged taking into account “considerations relating to manufacturing capabilities, as well as supply and demand in the relevant markets.”[[529]] Israeli authorities, for example, forbid the marketing of many fruits and vegetables from Gaza in the West Bank and Israel.[[530]] While there is a wider variety of produce that can be sold from Gaza in the West Bank, Israeli authorities only in practice permitted, as of March 2021, the sale of eggplants and tomatoes to the Israeli market.[[531]] It also until November 2020 banned processed goods from Gaza entering markets in the West Bank and Israel.[[532]] \nNot only do no such restrictions exist on Israeli producers in the OPT, but Israel has through its restrictions created in Gaza a “captive market,” as Gisha has put it, for Israeli businesses.[[533]] More than 80 percent of the goods entering Gaza are purchased from Israeli companies and suppliers, the value of which in 2015 alone amounted to almost 2 billion NIS (over $600 million), according to Gisha.[[534]] The Israeli cement company Nesher also produces nearly all the cement used in Gaza.[[535]] \nThese restrictions have devastated Gaza’s economy.[[536]] Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in Gaza dropped 23 percent between 1994 and 2016 in real dollars.[[537]] Eighty percent of Gaza’s population relies on humanitarian aid, according to UNRWA,[[538]] and more than half the population lives below the poverty line.[[539]] Unemployment rates in Gaza have for some time hovered around 50 percent and are higher for young people and women.[[540]] \nIsraeli policies also sharply limit access to basic services, such as electricity and water. Between 1967 and 2002, Gaza depended on electricity it received from the Israeli Electric Corporation (IEC).[[541]] Although Gaza’s power plant became operational in 2002, it has operated at only partial capacity, in part as a result of several Israeli aerial attacks, and Gaza remains “almost completely dependent,” as the Israeli Supreme Court put it in 2008, on Israel for its supply of electricity, either directly or indirectly.[[542]] The IEC, though, sells only a set quantity of electricity to Gaza, which is insufficient to meet the demand of the population, even if the power plant operated at full capacity, and periodically reduces supply.[[543]] In 2017, for example, it cut by 30 percent the amount it supplied Gaza, following a request from the PA, which sought to pressure Hamas authorities to relinquish their control over Gaza.[[544]] Israeli forces have bombed Gaza’s sole power plant on multiple occasions,[[545]] significantly reducing its capacity.[[546]] Israel’s restriction on the entry of goods, including spare parts and equipment deemed dual-use, has hampered efforts to repair the plant.[[547]] In addition, authorities periodically restrict, sometimes punitively and other times over disputes in payments, the amount of industrial fuel it allows to be purchased for the plant, which the plant needs to operate.[[548]] Israel has also restricted the entry of solar panels and batteries, hampering efforts to develop alternative energy sources that would give Gaza a degree of energy autonomy.[[549]] Gaza has at times purchased a small quantity of electricity from Egypt, but an amount insufficient to meet the needs of its residents.[[550]] In 2017 and 2018, Gaza averaged 6.2 hours per day of electricity; that figure increased to 12 in 2019, largely due to Israel permitting Qatar to purchase fuel for use in Gaza through Israeli vendors.[[551]] Meanwhile, Israeli settlers in the OPT enjoy uninterrupted electricity, mostly from the same IEC. Regular power outages affect many aspects of everyday life in Gaza, from heating and cooling and sewage treatment to health care and business.[[552]] \nGaza residents also do not have regular access to clean water. Gaza relies principally on the Coastal Aquifer, which runs along Israel’s coast and the Gaza Strip and is accessible inside Gaza via wells, as its sole water source.[[553]] Over-extraction, both upstream by Israelis and downstream by Palestinians in Gaza, as well as the intrusion of seawater, sewage, and nitrates, has left more than 96 percent of the groundwater “unfit for human consumption,” according to OCHA.[[554]] A 2018 study by the RAND Corporation found that water pollution accounts for 26 percent of illnesses in Gaza and is the leading cause of child mortality.[[555]] Gaza also purchases water from the Israeli water utility Mekorot, but Israel controls the supply. Water from Mekorot goes through the same pipeline system as the groundwater and mixes with it, reducing its quality.[[556]] Gaza’s old water pipeline system also causes about a 30 percent loss of supply through leaks,[[557]] but Israel complicates its maintenance by restricting the import of about 70 percent of the materials and equipment needed to repair the water and sewage systems on the grounds that they are “dual-use” items.[[558]] Gaza desalinates some water, but desalination requires significant electricity, fuel, and funding.[[559]] These limitations force most Gaza households to rely on purchasing purified water from private companies for drinking when they can afford it.[[560]] In 2019, Gaza residents used 79 liters per day of water, an increase from 2017 and 2018 levels, but below the WHO minimum recommended level of 100.[[561]] \n#### Case Studies: Gaza\n*The following individual case studies illustrate how Israeli authorities, through violations of basic rights, systematically oppress Palestinians in Gaza, a part of the OPT.*\n> > This is Gaza —you’re inside a big prison, wondering what the world outside has Yazan, 26\n“Yazan”: Yazan, 26, felt his dream had come true; the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom offered him admission for undergraduate studies. Yazan missed the start of the semester in October 2018, as he awaited a reply to his application for an Israeli-issued permit and a letter allowing him to travel via Jordan to the UK. He received the permit in December and, on December 18, 2018, arrived at the Erez Checkpoint to begin his journey. Upon his arrival, though, an Israeli soldier escorted him to a room for questioning. He told Human Rights Watch that soldiers asked him about the situation in Gaza, one of his neighbors and a payment his father made.[[562]] After waiting three hours, a soldier returned and said, “You’ll be able to travel and everything will go well. How about providing us with some simple things in exchange for money and travel?” Yazan took this statement to be a request to provide intelligence about people in his community, and he refused. The soldier turned him away, warning that “you are ruining your future,” and urged him “to think about it.” Yazan said he considered leaving via Rafah, the crossing with Egypt, but the Hamas-administered waiting list was long, he could not afford to pay the several thousand dollars to advance his place on the waitlist, and the opportunity passed. Israel’s separation policy effectively makes it impossible for Yazan to pursue educational or professional opportunities in the West Bank, even though his mother is from Nablus.[[563]] He ended up studying in Gaza and now does temporary contract jobs, but “still has the same dream to study abroad” and continues to pursue scholarships. He told Human Rights Watch, “I flew away with this dream, but suddenly fell down and found myself in the real world. I feel like a bird inside a cage—I can fly in the cage, but always remain inside it. This is Gaza—you’re inside a big prison, wondering what the world outside has.”\n“Leen”: Leen, a 23-year-old actress, received a permit to leave Gaza for a visa interview in Jerusalem in July 2016, but decided not to return and went to live with her uncle in Jenin. She told Human Rights Watch that her prior travels abroad made her feel that she “wouldn’t be able to achieve anything in Gaza” and could not come to terms with remaining there.[[564]] She began studying at university and acting, moved to Ramallah, and applied to change her address so she could legally remain in the West Bank. But she never heard back about her application. Israeli authorities have effectively frozen the population registry since 2000, blocking even address changes.[[565]] Her permit expired, Leen’s presence in the West Bank became illegal, and she said she began to fear getting stopped and removed back to Gaza. She said, “I dream of getting a Palestinian ID that would allow me to move freely and travel, then go back home to Gaza to see my family.” She now finds herself stuck, unable to visit her family, but unwilling to give up her dream of pursuing a better life in the West Bank. She added, “Gaza is a small prison. Ramallah is a big one…. If I had the chance to go back in time, I would have remained in Gaza and just learned to cope with life there.”\n“Samia”: Samia, a 27-year-old English teacher, traveled to Jordan in 2016 for her studies. She told Human Rights Watch that she soon decided to return to Gaza, but that her relatives whom she visited in the West Bank convinced her to stay with them.[[566]] She said she applied to change her address to the West Bank through the Palestinian Civil Affairs Office, which forwards applications to Israeli authorities, but she received no response. Samia began working as an English teacher in Ramallah and got engaged, but felt constantly restricted, unable to move freely with friends and family. On July 3, 2019, she set off in a taxi to visit her relatives in Nablus. On the way, Israeli soldiers stopped her at a checkpoint they had set-up. Upon seeing her address listed as Gaza, they accused her of “staying here illegally” and took her into custody at a military facility, where she spent the night. Early the next morning, she said, officers cuffed her around her feet and hands, put her in a vehicle without windows and drove her to the Erez Checkpoint, where they removed her back to Gaza without her belongings or even her ID card. “It was a nightmare,” Samia said. She had planned to get married in 2020 and had already rented a place and began furnishing it, then “everything was gone within seconds.” She could not believe, she said, that she “was deported from the second part of my country,” a place just an hour away. She applied for a permit to return to the West Bank, but the Palestinian Civil Affairs office in Gaza told her that Israelis had placed a 6-month security bloc on her, barring her from travel. She said her fiancé twice applied for permits to visit Gaza, but Israeli authorities denied him both times; once due to Jewish holidays and the other without reason. She “lost hope” and even “told [her] fiancé to break up with me, if we are not able to get together.” He refused, she said, and they continue to look for a way to live together.\n“Hadil”: In 2011, Hadil, a 37-year-old who works as a social media coordinator in Gaza, fell in love with a man from Nablus whom she met at a conference in Amman. She began applying for permits to visit him, but Israeli authorities routinely denied them, 11 times in total, she told Human Rights Watch.[[567]] In 2012, the man managed to enter Gaza through Egypt for a visit and the two got engaged. Shortly thereafter, following a July 2013 military coup, Egyptian authorities largely sealed their border with Gaza. Hadil applied in 2014 for a family reunification request to live with her fiancé in the West Bank, but that was rejected without a reason given. In late 2015, she managed to get a permit to attend a conference abroad. On her way back, during transit via the West Bank from Jordan, she contemplated staying. But she worried about getting caught and being sent “for life imprisonment in Gaza,” a reference to her fear that she would not be able to secure another travel permit, so she returned to Gaza, and the couple broke up in May 2015. In 2019, though, she managed to obtain permits through work to travel to the West Bank and met and got engaged to a man from Ramallah. She regularly worries, she said, about facing the same fate with this engagement. She has spoken to lawyers to file a request to change her address, she said, but they have told her that the odds are quite low that Israel will allow her to establish legal residence in the West Bank, and that the process will take significant time. Her fiancé’s family has encouraged her to stay without status in the West Bank, but she is unwilling to take that risk. The couple does not consider Gaza an option, she said, because they have already purchased a home in the West Bank and did not want to separate her fiancé from his family. With the path to living together in the OPT effectively closed, they are now, she said, focused on finding a way to live together abroad.\n“Kiran”: 33-year-old Kiran and her husband decided in 2016 to move from Gaza to the West Bank in search of a better life. Kiran told Human Rights Watch that her husband obtained a permit to travel as a businessperson and decided to remain in the West Bank.[[568]] Without meeting the stringent criteria for which Israel permits Gazan residents to travel, Kiran obtained a falsified medical referral indicating that her then 3-year-old son needed to travel for urgent medical care, she told Human Rights Watch. Authorities granted him a permit and her a permit to accompany him, and they traveled in 2017 alongside her 8-month-old second son. They have remained in the West Bank without status since. Her husband requested to change his address to one in the West Bank in 2016, but, as of writing, had not received a reply. Kiran said her family of five, including a third child they had in the West Bank, lives in “constant fear” of getting caught and being sent back to Gaza, and stays home whenever “there is any tension.” They “feel like strangers inside [their own] home,” as if they “are illegally residing in another country.” She said she has missed many family occasions in Gaza, including weddings for both of her brothers, and that her husband hasn’t seen his five children from a prior marriage since he left Gaza. She said she has considered returning to Gaza, but she worries about how life in Gaza would affect her three young boys. She told Human Rights Watch that “my boys get so happy when they see planes in the sky…I can’t imagine their reaction when they see the planes they love firing missiles and bombs. I don’t want them to experience war and death.”\n## Institutional Discrimination in Israel\nAuthorities inside Israel institutionally discriminate between the country’s Jewish and Palestinian inhabitants, though in ways less severe than the oppression and persecution of the OPT. There are roughly 6.2 million Jews and about 1.6 million Palestinians within Green Line Israel, according to data from the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics.[[569]] Israel’s Proclamation of Independence affirms the “complete equality” of all residents. Palestinians in Israel are citizens who have the right to vote in national elections, unlike Palestinians in the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem (except for the small minority of Palestinian Jerusalemites who have applied for and been granted Israeli citizenship). For the first 17 years of Israel’s existence as a nation, however, Israeli authorities placed most Palestinians under military rule, confining them to dozens of enclaves, requiring them to obtain permits to leave their enclaves, and severely restricting their rights.[[570]] When military rule ended in 1966, authorities granted Palestinians in Israel freedom of movement, but they continue to treat Jewish Israelis and Palestinians in starkly unequal ways, including with regards to legal status, land policies, and access to resources and services. This discriminatory treatment is undertaken to further Jewish Israeli control over demographics and land as officials have directly acknowledged.[[571]] \n### Legal Status\nIsrael maintains a two-track citizenship structure that treats Palestinians unequally as compared to Jews. While both Jews and Palestinians living in Israel are citizens, Israel’s citizenship process privileges Jews and sharply restricts which Palestinians, beyond most existing residents and their descendants, can become citizens.\nIsrael’s 1952 Citizenship Law at its outset notes that the state grants citizenship via four routes: (1) “return,” (2) “residence in Israel,” (3) birth, and (4) naturalization.[[572]] Israel reserves the first path, “return,” exclusively for Jews. This path grows out of the 1950 “Law of Return,” which guarantees Jewish citizens of other countries the right to settle in Israel.[[573]] The Citizenship Law states that Jews already living in Israel at the time gain citizenship via this path, as opposed to the “residence in Israel” one.\nPalestinians, by contrast, obtained citizenship in 1952 via the second path, “residence in Israel.” The law, though, conditions citizenship on proving residency before 1948, inclusion in the population registry, and continuous presence or legal entry in the period between 1948 and 1952. None of these restrictions apply to Jewish Israelis. The language not only excludes the more than 700,000 Palestinians that fled or were expelled from their homes in 1948, along with their descendants,[[574]] but also those not counted in the population registry due to a perfunctory registration process and those not present or not able to prove their residency either before 1948 or continuously between 1948 and 1952.[[575]] \n*Haaretz*reported in 2017 that Israeli authorities had revoked the citizenship of “hundreds if not thousands” of Palestinian Bedouins in the Negev region in recent years over alleged “erroneous registration” by them or their families between 1948 and 1952.[[576]] In an August 2020 Knesset hearing, government officials acknowledged investigating the circumstances around the granting of citizenship to about 2,600 people and said that they had concluded that about 500 of them had been granted citizenship by mistake, although they claimed to have reestablished the citizenship of 362 of them via an expedited process.[[577]] \nWhile the third path, birth, covers both Jews and Palestinians, the fourth, naturalization, applies only to non-Jews. The Citizenship Law permits the Interior Ministry to grant citizenship to those who meet a number of conditions, including several years of residency in Israel, intention to settle, knowledge of Hebrew, renunciation of foreign citizenship, and oath of loyalty.\nIn July 2003, the Israeli government issued Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law (Temporary Order), which effectively suspended the naturalization process, as well as the granting of long-term status, for Palestinian spouses of Israeli citizens or residents from the West Bank and Gaza.[[578]] The Supreme Court has upheld the law and the Knesset has renewed it every year since, most recently in June 2020. In 2005, the Knesset permitted Palestinian women over 25 and Palestinian men over 35 who are married to Israeli citizens or residents to apply for renewable temporary permits. In 2007, it expanded the scope of the restriction to apply to spouses from Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and Iran.[[579]] \nIsraeli authorities also distinguish between citizenship and nationality, and structurally discriminate between citizens based on theirnationality. The Israeli government registers the nationality of all citizens and, until 2005, included nationality on each citizen’s identity card.[[580]] Jewish Israelis and Palestinians are deemed to belong to different nationalities: “Jew” and “Arab”. While recognizing more than 140 nationalities, the government does not recognize an “Israeli nationality” and has denied requests of citizens to identify their nationality as such.[[581]] Citizens have appealed this denial to the Supreme Court, which upheld it. In 2013, the Court reaffirmed a 1972 ruling denying that “an Israeli nationality had come into being, separate and differentiated from a Jewish nationality.”[[582]] In a concurring opinion, Justice Hanan Melcer wrote that “the ‘constitutional Jewishness’ of the state negates the legal possibility of recognizing an ‘Israeli nationality’ which is distinct, as it were, from the ‘Jewish nationality’.”[[583]] \nThe bifurcation between citizenship and nationality means that Israeli law relegates Palestinians at birth to an inferior status by law. Israel has long defined itself as the “nation-state of the Jewish people,” as enshrined in its 2018 Basic Law: Israel—The Nation-State of the Jewish People. That law, which has constitutional status, articulates for Jews alone the right of self-determination and makes it a national priority to build homes for Jews but not others.[[584]] Excluding Palestinians from the state’s definition of the nation provides a legal basis to pursue policies that favor Jewish Israelis to the detriment of Palestinians, in the name of advancing the “national interest” or “national security.” For example, in November 2020, an Israeli magistrate court cited the 2018 Nation-State law to dismiss a lawsuit by two Palestinian schoolchildren seeking reimbursement for expenses incurred commuting to a nearby Palestinian school, since there are no such schools in the city of Karmiel in northern Israel where they live. The ruling stated that “Karmiel is a Jewish city intended to solidify Jewish settlement in the Galilee. The establishment of an Arabic-language school or even the funding of school transportation for Arab students is liable to alter the demographic balance and damage the city’s character.” It added that “the development and establishment of Jewish settlement is a national value enshrined in the Basic Law and is a worthy and dominant consideration in municipal decision-making.”[[585]] \nLegal measures aimed at protecting the Jewish character of the state that discriminate against Palestinians undermine the pledge in Israel’s Proclamation of Independence to “ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex.” Palestinian citizens vote in elections and have served in the Knesset, but Israel’s Basic Law: The Knesset—1958, which has constitutional status, declares that no candidate can run for the Knesset if they expressly or implicitly endorse “negation of the existence of the State of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state.”[[586]] Israel’s Law of Political Parties (1992) further bars registration of any party whose goals directly or indirectly deny “the existence of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state.”[[587]] While the Supreme Court often opts against disqualifying candidates for violating these provisions,[[588]] the provisions formally block Palestinians from challenging the laws that codify their subjugation and, in so doing, diminish the value of the right of Palestinian citizens to vote. The fact that no government in Israel’s history has ever included representatives of a Palestinian-led party highlights the political disempowerment of the community.[[589]] \nPalestinian former Knesset member Azmi Bishara, in describing the situation of Palestinians inside Israel, writes, “in 1948, we lost a country and gained citizenship.”[[590]] \n### Land and Housing\nAs a result of decades of land confiscations and discriminatory land policies, Israeli authorities have hemmed in Palestinian towns and villages, while nurturing the growth and expansion of Jewish communities, many of which in practice exclude Palestinians. The majority of Palestinians in Israel live in these communities, while some live in “mixed cities” like Tel Aviv-Jaffa and Haifa.[[591]] \nNinety-three percent of all land in Israel constitutes state land, directly controlled by the Israeli government.[[592]] Israeli authorities confiscated much of this land, several million dunams, from Palestinians through several different legal instruments, as documented in a later chapter of this report.[[593]] A government agency, the Israel Land Authority (ILA), manages and allocates state lands. Almost half the members of its governing body belong to the JNF,[[594]] whose explicit mandate is to develop and lease land for Jews and not any other segment of the population.[[595]] The fund owns 13 percent of Israel’s land, which the state is mandated to use “for the purpose of settling Jews.”[[596]] \nIsraeli authorities have almost exclusively allocated state lands for the development and expansion of Jewish communities.[[597]] Since 1948, the government has authorized the creation of more than 900 “Jewish localities” in Israel,[[598]] but none for Palestinians except for a handful of government-planned townships and villages in the Negev and Galilee, created largely to concentrate previously displaced Bedouin communities.[[599]] Less than 3 percent of all land in Israel falls under the jurisdiction of Palestinian municipalities, where the majority of Palestinian citizens live, according to a 2017 estimate by Israeli and Palestinian groups.[[600]] \nEven inside Palestinian towns and villages within Israel, Israeli authorities discriminatorily restrict the land available for residential growth. The authorities have zoned large sections of Palestinian towns and villages for “agricultural” use or as “green” areas, prohibited residential building in them, and built roads and other infrastructure projects that impede expansion. A 2003 Israeli government-commissioned report found that “many Arab towns and villages were surrounded by land designated for purposes such as security zones, Jewish regional councils, national parks and nature reserves or highways, which prevent or impede the possibility of their expansion in the future.”[[601]] While increasing focus in recent years on these issues has resulted in more state-approved residential development,[[602]] they have done little to date to change the reality of hemmed-in Palestinian towns and villages. By contrast, in case studies documented by Human Rights Watch in each of Israel’s six districts, planning authorities provided sufficient land and zoning permissions to predominantly Jewish communities to facilitate their growth.[[603]] \nThese restrictions create density problems and a housing crunch in Palestinian communities. The Arab Center for Alternative Planning, based in Israel, told Human Rights Watch in December 2018 that it estimates that 15 to 20 percent of homes in Palestinian towns and villages lack permits, some because owners’ applications were rejected and others because they did not apply knowing that authorities would reject their requests on the grounds that they were contrary to the existing zoning. The group estimated that 60,000 to 70,000 homes in Israel, excluding Jerusalem, were at risk as of 2018 of full demolition.[[604]] As of July 2015, 97 percent of Israel’s pending judicial demolition orders were for structures located in Palestinian towns.[[605]] \nThese dynamics most dramatically manifest themselves in the Negev, where discriminatory Israeli policies and practices leave about 90,000 Palestinian Bedouins living in “unrecognized” informal communities, where their homes face the constant threat of demolition.[[606]] At the same time, Israeli authorities and quasi-governmental bodies have invested billions of shekels in building new developments in the Negev designed predominantly for Jews.[[607]] \nIsraeli law permits towns with up to 400 households in the Negev and the Galilee regions, areas that comprise two-thirds of the land in Israel,[[608]] to maintain admissions committees that can reject applicants from living there for being “not suitable for the social life of the community” or for incompatibility with the “social-cultural fabric.”[[609]] This authority effectively permits the exclusion of Palestinians from small Jewish towns, which Adalah, a human rights group based in Haifa, estimated in 2014 make up 43 percent of all towns in Israel, albeit a far smaller percentage of the country’s population.[[610]] In a 2015 study, Yosef Jabareen, a professor at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa, found that there are more than 900 small Jewish towns, including*kibbutzim*, across Israel that can restrict who can live there and have no Palestinian citizens living in them.[[611]] \n[![202104mena_israelpalestine_bornunequal_negev] \nClick to expand Image\n] \n### Resources and Services\nIsraeli authorities discriminate in the provision of resources and services between Palestinian and Jewish localities inside Israel. Revenues for localities in Israel derive principally from two sources: those generated locally by taxes and those received from the central government. The rights groups Sikkuy and Injaz found in a 2014 report that while local taxes make up 66 percent of the revenue for localities across Israel, they constitute only 31 percent of the overall budget for Palestinian localities.[[612]] While the gap in part reflects the significantly lower tax base in Palestinian localities, the groups found a larger disparity in income from non-residential or business taxes. They, in particular, highlighted the dearth of “revenue-generating properties” in Palestinian municipalities, including in the residential, industrial, commercial, tourism, banking, and infrastructure sectors.[[613]] In May 2020, Sikkuy found, based on 2018 data, that while Jewish localities collected 2.5 times more in residential taxes than Palestinian ones, they collected 6.5 times more in non-residential taxes.[[614]] \nThe significantly higher levels of non-residential local taxes that Jewish localities collect are the result of discriminatory state policies. The Knesset Research and Information Center found in July 2018 that only 2 percent of industrial zones managed by the government, which generate significant tax income, are located in Palestinian municipalities.[[615]] Government buildings also generate significant tax revenues, but, according to a July 2020 study by Knesset Research and Information Center, only 0.4 percent of government properties that generate tax revenues are located within Palestinian municipalities.[[616]] In addition, according to Sikkuy, not a single Palestinian municipality has a government hospital, university, military base, or government administrative buildings in it.[[617]] An April 2020 study by the Knesset Research and Information Center found that Palestinian localities, where about 90 percent of Palestinian citizens of Israel reside,[[618]] received in 2018 only 2.2 percent of the total amount of non-residential taxes across the country.[[619]] \nLocalities which collect less revenue from local taxes rely more on funding from the central government. Here too, Israeli authorities allocate budgets in a discriminatory fashion. For example, of the 2.82 billion NIS ($804 million) of economic recovery funds handed out by the Israeli government to local authorities in April 2020 amid the Covid-19 pandemic, only 1.7 percent went to Palestinian municipalities, according to Adalah.[[620]] In education, the Israeli government operates two separate school systems, one for Jewish children and one for Palestinian children in Israel.[[621]] Discrimination colors every aspect of the two systems; often overcrowded and understaffed, poorly built or maintained, state schools for Palestinian children offer fewer facilities and educational opportunities than what are offered to Jewish Israeli children.[[622]] The Haifa-based rights group Mossawa Center found based on government data that, in 2013, the annual expenditure per student in Palestinian localities was 734 NIS ($220), as compared to 3,344 NIS ($1,004) in poor Jewish localities and 5,934 NIS ($1,781) in wealthier Jewish ones.[[623]] Citing government data for that same school year,*Haaretz*found that expenditures by the state for Jewish Israeli high school students were 35 to 68 percent higher than for Palestinian students at the same socioeconomic level.[[624]] \nWhile authorities in recent years have reduced budgeting inequities, significant gaps remain. In particular, a five-year, more than 10 billion NIS ($3 billion) “economic development plan for the Arab sector”[[625]] approved in December 2015 has increased allocation to sectors like transportation. However, it did not address other areas of disparity, including welfare services and high school education.[[626]] Palestinian localities have also received funding from “equalization grants” provided by the central government and from a governmental fund aimed at “closing the [economic] gaps” between differently situated localities, but, according to Sikkuy, not to levels proportional to the gaps that exist in comparison to Jewish localities.[[627]] The Mossawa Center found in a study of Israel’s 2019 budget that funding allocated to Palestinian areas remains “meager,” with significant needs in education and other areas still present, and that “systematic discrimination” remains endemic in government spending.[[628]] \nThese disparities contribute to the starkly different socio-economic situations for Palestinians and Jewish citizens. According to May 2020 figures from Israel’s Ministry for Social Equality, 45.3 percent of Palestinian families live below the poverty line, as compared to 13.4 percent of Jewish families.[[629]] Sikkuy in 2015 found that the wage gap between Palestinian and Jewish men stood at 44.6 percent and at 31 percent for women, and that 47.4 percent of Palestinians worked in unskilled labor and construction, as compared to 10.4 percent of Jewish Israelis.[[630]] \n### Case Study: Nazareth\n*The following case study details how Israeli authorities discriminate against the residents of the Palestinian city of Nazareth in Israel in ways that stifle the community’s growth and undermine its well-being while promoting the development of a Jewish-majority city next to it.*\nNazareth, the largest Palestinian locality in Israel with a population of 77,400,[[631]] lies in the Galilee region within Israel’s Northern District. It is the only Palestinian city that survived the events of 1948 intact.[[632]] Discriminatory Israeli land policies have restricted it to largely the same geographical area it had then, while its population has increased more than five-fold.[[633]] Meanwhile, Israeli authorities established Nazareth Illit (Upper Nazareth, renamed in 2019 Nof HaGalil; referenced henceforward by its original name) in the 1950s as a “Jewish town,”[[634]] according to Israel’s first Prime Minister David Ben Gurion, in order to, as a then-senior official put it, “swallow up” Nazareth.[[635]] A road, Highway 75 or Zionism Road, largely demarcates the boundary today between Nazareth and Nazareth Illit. Israeli authorities have over the years nurtured the growth and development of Nazareth Illit, often at Nazareth’s expense. Today, Nazareth Illit has developed into a “mixed city” with about 26 percent of its population Palestinian, in large part due to the migration of Nazarenes amid the squeeze they face, as described below.[[636]] \nSlated to belong to the Arab State under the 1947 UN partition plan, Nazareth came under Israeli control in July 1948. Unlike the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians forced to leave their communities during the establishment of the Israeli state, the residents of Nazareth largely remained in their homes. According to historian Benny Morris, Israeli officials gave the order to “uproot all the residents of Nazareth,” but the commander of the nascent Israeli army’s brigade given the order, Ben Dunkelman, refused to carry it out, and authorities eventually allowed the city to surrender.[[637]] Nazareth’s population increased in the aftermath of the events of 1948, as it absorbed more than 5,000 Palestinians who had been displaced from nearby villages and prevented from returning to them.[[638]] Many displaced Palestinians have since remained in Nazareth, unable to return to their villages.[[639]] \nOne displaced Palestinian, 85-year-old souvenir-shop-owner Ameen Muhammad Ali, known as Abu Arab, told Human Rights Watch that he ended up in Nazareth in 1949 months after he and his family fled his home village of Safuriyya, which then stood six kilometers north of Nazareth, amid Israeli fire.[[640]] He was 13 at the time. After several months in Lebanon, he said his family managed to cross back into Israel before Israeli forces tightened border controls and blocked refugees from returning.[[641]] Some other Safuriyya residents also managed to return, which prompted Israeli authorities in January 1949, as historian Benny Morris documented, to forcibly expel residents who remained in the village or had returned there.[[642]] Later that year, Israeli authorities established the Jewish*moshav*, or cooperative village, of Tzipori on Safuriyya’s lands.[[643]] Abu Arab said his family lost their home and about 200 dunams of land they owned in the village.\nLater in 1949, Abu Arab’s family moved to a neighborhood in Nazareth that came to be known as Safafra because of the many displaced Safuriyya residents who ended up there.[[644]] In January 2001,*Haaretz*estimated that internally displaced Palestinians and their descendants constitute about half of Nazareth’s population.[[645]] Most of Abu Arab’s family who lived in Safuriyya, including several dozen aunts, uncles, and cousins, never returned to the country, and they and their descendants remain refugees today, largely barred from even visiting. Abu Arab said he sometimes visits Tzipori, which today restricts who can live or enter there, in part to take care of five cemeteries in the*moshav*where Safuriyya’s ancestors, including two of his cousins, are buried. He said he used to be able to see the lands of Safuriyya from his home in Nazareth and longs to return.[[646]] \nShortly after the establishment of the Israeli state, Israeli authorities placed Nazareth under military rule and began in the 1950s implementing a policy to “Judaize the Galilee.”[[647]] The establishment of Nazareth Illit became a key part of that strategy, as the army’s then-Planning Department Director Yuval Ne’eman put it, to “emphasize and safeguard the Jewish character of the Galilee as a whole.”[[648]] The northern military governor at the time, Colonel Mikhael Mikhael, wrote that the establishment of Nazareth Illit would result in the “transfer of the center of gravity of life from Nazareth to the Jewish neighborhood.”[[649]] \nIsraeli authorities established Nazareth Illit in the 1950s on lands belonging to residents of Nazareth and other nearby villages. The first confiscation, of about 1,200 dunams of land from Nazareth, took place in June 1954 under a 1943 law (Acquisition for Public Purpose Ordinance), a relic of British mandate law that permits the taking of land for a public purpose.[[650]] Nazarenes brought a legal challenge against the decision, but the Israeli Supreme Court upheld it, based on a state declaration that it confiscated the land solely to build government facilities.[[651]] Authorities used only a fraction of the land for government facilities—109 dunams, according to one historian—with most of it going to develop a “Jewish neighborhood” inside Nazareth.[[652]] In August 1952, Government Secretary Ze’ev Sherf said, “the only chance of making Nazareth a partially Jewish city is by consolidating the [state] institutions there. It is a colonizing act with difficulties, but without it we will not be able to Judaize Nazareth.”[[653]] \nKeen to avoid relegating the Jewish community to a minority status in Nazareth, Israeli officials opted in the late 1950s to make Nazareth Illit a separate locality, with the aim of later merging the municipalities once the Jewish community surpassed the Palestinian population.[[654]] Authorities continued to confiscate Palestinian land to develop Nazareth Illit into the 1960s and 1970s, including a 160 dunam plot of land in the center of Nazareth known as the Sprinzak Enclave. A military base for years and home to a hotel, the site falls within the municipality of Nazareth Illit, despite its location in the center of Nazareth, meaning Nazareth Illit receives the taxes based on the facilities there.[[655]] Through these confiscations, Nazareth Illit deepened its footprint in the Galilee, weaving between Nazareth and six other Palestinian villages and impeding the establishment of a larger, contiguous Palestinian municipal area. Nazareth-based journalist Jonathan Cook has written that Nazareth Illit’s development blocked Nazareth from “transform[ing] into the true capital of Israel’s Palestinian minority,” a nearly 200,000 person “conurbation” in the center of Israel, and instead effectively turned Nazareth into, as one Nazarene put it to him, “the largest Arab village in Israel.”[[656]] \nNazareth had a population of about 15,000 and a land mass, according to one historian, of 12,599 dunams before 1948.[[657]] Today, its population is 77,400 and its size is 14,172 dunams.[[658]] Israeli authorities only approved their first master plan for Nazareth in 2009; the prior plan had been established in 1942 under the British Mandate.[[659]] The total expansion of Nazareth over more than 70 years, totaling more than 6,000 dunams, has only slightly outpaced the land lost during the events around the establishment of Israel in 1948 and in the years that followed.[[660]] The Nazareth municipality has in subsequent years estimated that it needed between 10,403 and 12,378 more dunams to meet the needs of residents, including for new residential neighborhoods, land for industrial and commercial development, and more public spaces.[[661]] In a survey of Nazareth residents conducted in 2013 by Professor Yosef Jabareen of the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa, 71.8 percent of those surveyed said that the local regulations barred them from any construction to expand their current properties.[[662]] \nThe restricted access to land for housing to accommodate natural population growth has created density problems and a housing crunch in Nazareth. In the same survey, 86.6 of residents identified traffic and 83.7 population density as “very serious” problems.[[663]] Musab Dukhan, a member of Nazareth’s municipal council, told Human Rights Watch that “narrow streets and a lack of space for parking creates heavy traffic” and that “there is no space for the new generation to build a future here and remain in the city.”[[664]] One resident described Nazareth as a “city that can’t breathe and always feels tense.”[[665]] \nWhile restricting Nazareth, Israeli authorities have allowed Nazareth Illit to grow rapidly. Built in part on state land and designated as a city to receive new Jewish immigrants, Israeli authorities invested heavily in Nazareth Illit, including by establishing in 1992 the Ziporit Industrial Area, which includes factories and a park for high-tech companies. While slated to be a regional industrial zone encompassing 3,560 dunams,[[666]] none of the revenues it generates go to Nazareth, located just to the south, or Palestinian villages directly adjacent to it.[[667]] Nazareth, by contrast, has two small industrial zones, one consisting of carpentry workshops in the Old City and the other of car repair shops.[[668]] \nNazareth long served as a regional administrative hub. Beginning in the late 1950s, Israeli authorities gradually relocated many government offices servicing the region from Nazareth to Nazareth Illit. The offices moved include those belonging to the agriculture ministry, the education ministry, the health ministry, the interior ministry, the prime minister’s office, the census bureau, the customs, and value-added tax division, the taxation authority, the land registration department, and the Magistrate’s, District and District Labor Courts.[[669]] Some buildings are located to the west of Highway 75, on the Nazareth side of the road, but fall within the municipal boundaries Nazareth Illit.\nMoving these offices meant that Nazareth lost access to the significant tax revenues that government offices generate and that could have spurred development.[[670]] In a 2017 report, the Arab Center for Alternative Planning calculated that Nazareth received less than 30 percent of the per capita non-residential taxes, which largely stem from taxes on businesses and government properties, of Nazareth Illit.[[671]] \nThe Israeli government policy of funneling resources from Nazareth to Nazareth Illit has also underlined its approach to tourism. Although widely known as Jesus’ hometown and home to a key church in the Christian tradition, authorities historically invested little in Nazareth’s tourism infrastructure and, as a result, the city benefited little from the flocks of religious tourists that visit.[[672]] Authorities only in 1993 granted Nazareth the status of “National Priority A” in tourism—a status that qualifies the city to receive grants and tax breaks—in preparation for the millennium and planned visit by the Pope at the time.[[673]] The first commercial chain hotel in Nazareth did not open until the late 1990s.[[674]] Subsequent governments revoked Nazareth’s tourism priority status, while retaining it for Nazareth Illit, which had received it in the 1970s.[[675]] \nThree business owners in or near Nazareth’s Old City—one runs a restaurant, one a café, and one a souvenir shop—told Human Rights Watch that tourists and in particular organized tour groups often spend only an hour or two visiting Nazareth’s churches, without entering the Old City or spending money or the night in the city.[[676]] Some stay in hotels in Nazareth Illit, while others continue on to eat and sleep in the nearby predominantly Jewish city of Tiberias, on the Sea of Galilee.[[677]] \nThe lack of revenue-generating properties, as well as discriminatory allocation of budgets from the central government, means Nazareth residents often receive inferior services compared to those in Nazareth Illit. The business owners each separately contrasted the traffic, lack of parking spaces, and narrow roads in Nazareth with the availability of parking and open roads in Nazareth Illit.[[678]] A 2015 study by the Knesset Research and Information Center found that the average class size in Nazareth is 30.3, as compared to 21.4 in Nazareth Illit.[[679]] Dukhan, the municipal council official, said that, as of April 2021, the difference in the number of students per classroom between Nazareth and Nazareth Illit had risen to at least 10 and, in some cases, up to 20.[[680]] \nThe housing crunch, density, and high rents push many Nazarenes to quit the city. Nazarenes often head to nearby predominantly Jewish localities to spend time in parks, given the paucity of those or other public spaces in their hometown. When one Nazareth resident sought to enter a public park in the nearby predominantly Jewish city of Afula in June 2019, security guards barred her entry upon learning that she was from Nazareth, just months after Afula’s mayor promised to act against the “conquest of the park,” calling for residents to “hoist Israeli flags throughout the park and play music in Hebrew,” and campaigned on a platform of “preserving the Jewish character of Afula.”[[681]] The city reversed course and agreed to open its park to all visitors following a lawsuit by Adalah.[[682]] \nIronically, thousands of Nazarenes have moved to Nazareth Illit in recent years, many of them purchasing property from Jewish Israelis who were resettled there as immigrants and then earned enough to “head for a better life in the center of the country,” according to Cook.[[683]] Nazarene restaurant owner Khalil Haddad, 43, told Human Rights Watch that, although born and raised in Nazareth Illit, he and his wife decided when they got married in 2006 to live in Nazareth, considering it their “national duty” as Palestinians. However, the population density, housing crunch, and lack of playgrounds, parks, and other public spaces gradually eroded his opposition to living in Nazareth Illit, and they finally decided to move there in 2014.[[684]] \nSome of the factors that motivated Haddad to leave the city he loved with his young family bear some similarities to pressures that lead urban dwellers in other contexts to move out of cities, including high housing costs, congestion, and a shortage of green space. In the case of Nazareth, these pressures in part derive from discriminatory Israeli land and budgetary policies.\nHava Bachar, Nazareth Illit’s general manager, told Human Rights Watch in 2020 that 26 percent of the city’s residents today are Palestinian, many from Nazareth, which she attributes to the fact that “Nazareth and other nearby [Palestinian] towns do not have space to grow.”[[685]] Bachar noted that the municipality was not about to “give away land” to these communities, given “our ambition to reach 100,000 citizens” and suggested instead that Israel build “a new city for Arab citizens.”[[686]] Bachar noted that the city is “bringing in Jewish families to settle” in order to “ensure it stays Jewish.”[[687]] \nDespite moving, many Nazarenes who live in Nazareth Illit maintain a center of life in Nazareth. Haddad said he continues to do his shopping, including for groceries, in Nazareth, referring to Nazareth Illit as a “bedroom community.”[[688]] It does not have a state school to serve the roughly 3,000 school-age Palestinian children, forcing most, including Haddad’s son, to commute to Nazareth, since Palestinian and Jewish Israelis attend separate schools.[[689]] Former Nazareth Illit mayor Shimon Gafsou, who once described Nazareth as a “nest of terror,”[[690]] told the*Washington Post*in 2013 that “I would rather cut off my right arm than build an Arab school.”[[691]] \n#### Conclusion\nIsraeli authorities use a series of policies and practices to methodically privilege Jewish Israelis and repress Palestinians. The severity of the repression carried out in the OPT amounts to “systematic oppression” by one racial group over another, a key component for the crime of apartheid as set out in both the Rome Statute and Apartheid Convention.[[692]] \n# V. Inhumane Acts and Other Abuses of Fundamental Rights\nGrave abuses, or “inhuman[e] acts” as set out in the Apartheid Convention and Rome Statute, amount to the crime against humanity of apartheid when carried out in the context of systematic oppression with an intent to maintain a system of domination. Severe abuses of fundamental rights make up the crime against humanity of persecution when carried out with discriminatory intent.\nTo maintain the domination of Jewish Israelis over Palestinians, Israeli authorities have carried out over many years a range of serious abuses.\nIn the OPT, many of these abuses amount to inhumane acts, one of the three elements of the crime of apartheid, including:\n* sweeping restrictions on movement;\n* the confiscation of hundreds of thousands of dunams of land in the West Bank from Palestinians, depriving them of their property, means of livelihood and way of life, and consequent hemming in of the densely populated enclaves where most live;\n* the imposition of harsh conditions, including near-categorical denial of building permits, in large parts of the West Bank that coerce thousands to abandon their homes in conditions that amount to forcible transfer;\n* the denial of residency rights to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians and their relatives for being abroad when the occupation began in 1967, or for long periods during the first few decades of the occupation, or as a result of the effective freeze on family reunification over the past two decades; and\n* the suspension of basic civil rights, such as freedom of assembly and association, depriving millions of the opportunity to have a voice in the wide range of affairs that most affect their daily lives and futures.\nSeparately from the inhumane acts carried out in the OPT, the Israeli government has carried out abuses against Palestinians within Israel, including:\n* refusing to allow Palestinians access to the millions of dunams of land that were confiscated from them;\n* implementing policies that make it virtually impossible for tens of thousands of Palestinians in the Negev region to live lawfully in the communities they have lived in for decades;\n* not permitting the more than 700,000 Palestinians who fled or were expelled in 1948 and their descendants to return to Israel; and\n* restricting legal residency in ways that block many Palestinian spouses and families from living together in Israel.\nCarried out pursuant to long-standing policies and practices of the Israeli government, these acts dispossess many Palestinians, bar some from entering their places of origin, block others from leaving it, forcibly separate families, and wreak havoc on the lives of many more.\n[![202104mena_israelpalestine_inhumanacts] \nClick to expand Image\n] \n## Inhumane Acts in the OPT\nIsraeli authorities have carried out a range of inhumane acts in the OPT.\n### Movement Restrictions\nFor over two decades, Israeli authorities have imposed sweeping restrictions on the ability of the more than 2 million Palestinians living in Gaza to leave that territory and sharply restricted the movement of 2.7 million Palestinians in the West Bank, both within that territory and beyond.\n#### Closure of Gaza\nFor the last 25 years, Israel has increasingly restricted the movement of Gaza residents. Since 2007, the year that Hamas seized effective political control over the Gaza Strip from the Fatah-led PA, Israel has imposed a generalized travel ban on movement in and out of the small territory with few exceptions. The Israeli army since 2007 has limited travel through the Erez Crossing, the passenger crossing from Gaza to the other part of the OPT, the West Bank, and abroad, as well as to Israel. Israel has limited passage to cases presenting what it deems “exceptional humanitarian circumstances,” meaning mainly those needing vital medical treatment outside Gaza and their companions, although authorities also grant permits each year to hundreds of Gaza residents eligible on other grounds, such as high-level businesspeople and merchants.[[693]] Israel has restricted movement even for those seeking to travel under these narrow exceptions to Israel’s closure policy.[[694]] Most Gaza residents do not fit within these exemptions. For the five-year period between January 2015 and December 2019, an average of about 373 Palestinians exited Gaza via Erez each day, less than 1.5 percent of the daily average of 26,000 in September 2000, before the closure, according to the Israeli rights group Gisha.[[695]] Most Palestinians who grew up under this closure have never exited Gaza.\nIsraeli authorities have also for more than two decades sharply restricted the use of Gaza’s airspace and territorial waters by Palestinians. They blocked both reopening an airport that Palestinians once operated there, and building a seaport, leaving them dependent on leaving Gaza by land in order to travel abroad.[[696]] Egypt has for much of the last 15 years largely kept shut its border crossing with Gaza, Gaza’s only other outlet to the outside world, contributing to the closure.\nIsrael restricts all travel between Gaza and the West Bank, despite its having recognized the two to be part of a single territorial unit,[[697]] even when the travel takes place via the circuitous route through Egypt and Jordan rather than through Israeli territory. The closure adversely affects many aspects of everyday life and contributes to other violations of Palestinians’ rights, including the right to family reunification, the right to access healthcare, education, and economic opportunities.[[698]] \nIsraeli authorities often justify the closure on security grounds. Authorities have said in particular that they want to minimize travel between Gaza and the West Bank to prevent transferring “a human terrorist infrastructure” from Gaza to the West Bank, the latter of which has a porous border with Israel and is home to hundreds of thousands of Israeli settlers.[[699]] \nAs an occupying power that maintains significant control over aspects of life in Gaza despite the formal withdrawal of its troops,[[700]] Israel has obligations under international humanitarian law to ensure the welfare of the population there. Palestinians also have the right under international human rights law to freedom of movement, in particular, within the OPT, that Israel can restrict only in response to concrete, specific security threats. Its policy of presumptively denying free movement, with narrow exceptions, based on generalized security threats and irrespective of any individualized assessment of the security risk of the individual, fails any reasonable test of balancing Israel’s security concerns against the human right to freedom of movement. While Israel has legitimate security concerns in regulating entry to its territory, those concerns cannot justify the massive violation of rights that the near-total travel ban inflicts on the over two million Palestinians living in a sliver of territory.\n#### Permit Regime in the West Bank\nIsraeli authorities have also imposed onerous restrictions on freedom of movement in the West Bank that they justify based on “substantive security reasons” given that “Palestinian residents from the region carried out… hundreds of deadly terrorist attacks.”[[701]] Israeli policies, however, restrict the movement of all Palestinians, not just those whom authorities deem to present a security threat. The army requires Palestinian ID holders, with narrow exemptions, to apply to the Israeli army for time-limited permits to enter significant parts of the West Bank,[[702]] including East Jerusalem, the “seam zone” between the separation barrier and the Green Line which covers more than 184,000 dunams,[[703]] and areas controlled by settlements and the army, while allowing Israelis and foreigners to move freely among these areas, as well as to Israel, without permits. To obtain permits, Palestinians “face an arbitrary, entirely non-transparent bureaucratic system,” with “no way of assessing the chances that their applications will be approved or how soon,” according to the Israeli rights group B’Tselem.[[704]] “Many applications are denied without explanation, with no real avenue for appeal,” and “permits already granted are easily revoked, also without explanation,” B’Tselem adds. Those denied permits include many who have never been detained or convicted on security grounds.[[705]] The uncertainty discourages many Palestinians from applying for permits at all.\nWhen it comes to travel abroad, Palestinians in the West Bank must travel via Jordan through the Israeli-controlled Allenby Crossing, unless they receive a difficult-to-secure permit to leave from Ben Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv. But Israeli authorities sometimes ban them from using that crossing on unspecified security grounds.[[706]] Between 2015 and 2019, the Israeli rights group HaMoked filed administrative appeals against 797 Israeli-issued travel bans on Palestinians.[[707]] \nWhile countries have wide latitude to restrict entry at their own borders, Israel largely restricts movement of the occupied population not only to travel between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, even when it does not take place through Israel, but also within the West Bank itself. Israeli authorities, for example, have erected nearly 600 permanent obstacles, such as checkpoints and roadblocks, within the West Bank, according to OCHA.[[708]] Palestinians also regularly face ad-hoc “flying” checkpoints across the West Bank—OCHA estimated that Israeli forces set up nearly 1,500 such checkpoints between April 2019 and March 2020 alone.[[709]] Israeli forces routinely turn away or humiliate and delay Palestinians at checkpoints without explanation, obstructing commutes to school, work, or appointments of all kinds.[[710]] The separation barrier, 85 percent of which falls within the West Bank rather than along the Green Line, further encumbers movement in the West Bank.[[711]] \nThe generalized travel ban Israeli authorities impose on Gaza, presumptively blocking residents from leaving Gaza, amounts to a measure that denies Palestinians “the right to leave and to return to their country,” one of the inhumane acts set out in the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid.[[712]] The Gaza closure, the severe movement restrictions in the West Bank, and the restrictions on movement between the West Bank and Gaza, two parts of the OPT, also violate Palestinians’ “right to freedom of movement,” as also outlined in the Apartheid Convention.[[713]] The closure, with its severe restrictions on the entry and exit of people and goods and provisions of services,[[714]] also constitutes “conditions preventing the full development” of the community, as also defined in the Apartheid Convention.[[715]] \n### Land Expropriation and Creation of Separate Enclaves (West Bank, East Jerusalem)\nUsing a range of official justifications, Israel has since 1967 taken over much of the land in the West Bank from Palestinians in large part to serve the needs of Jewish Israeli settlers. B’Tselem and Kerem Navot have found that Israeli authorities have confiscated more than 2 million dunams of land, making up more than one-third of the West Bank.[[716]] Israeli settlement authorities effectively control these lands, including about 540,000 that fall within their formal jurisdiction.\nMost commonly, Israeli authorities take land, including land privately owned by Palestinians, by declaring it to be “state land.”[[717]] The Israeli group Peace Now estimates that the Israeli government holds about 1.4 million dunams of land, or about a quarter of the West Bank, as state land.[[718]] \nUnder Israeli judicial and military practice and policy, land not formally registered as privately owned by authorities who controlled the West Bank before 1967 can be declared state land. Upon seizing control of the West Bank in 1967, the Israeli military froze the land registration process that had been underway under Jordanian auspices and has not conducted one since. Landowners who did not register their land before 1967 have the onus of proving ownership through a lengthy and expensive process that typically involves producing tax documents, gathering testimonies from neighbors and local officials, and paying for a court-approved survey of the land.[[719]] In some cases, the authorities declared as state land parcels on which Palestinian landowners had paid taxes to the Jordanian authorities, a hallmark of ownership at the time. Israeli courts have upheld as legal the state’s mechanism for declaring state land.[[720]] \nEven if ownership can be proved, Israeli authorities interpret Ottoman land law in such a way as to take land without paying compensation to the owners when it can claim that at least 50 percent of the parcel has not been cultivated within the prior three years.[[721]] This interpretation facilitated the takeover of “absentee” property belonging to Palestinians who fled during or following the 1967 War, as well as from Palestinians who remained in the West Bank but lost access to their land.[[722]] Beginning in 1979, following an Israeli Supreme Court ruling that restricted the army’s authority to transfer to settlements lands confiscated on purported security grounds that it recognized as privately owned by Palestinians,[[723]] the Israeli military Custodian of Government Property conducted a hasty and error-riddled land survey that aimed to identify uncultivated lands that Israeli authorities could claim as state land.[[724]] Based on the survey, Israeli authorities declared as state land parcels that had been cultivated but not intensely, that consisted of rocky terrain where much of the land is not arable, and where Palestinian residents had staked claims to the land through the informal mechanisms used to establish ownership in the West Bank, but had not registered it in the official land registry.[[725]] \nThrough this process, Israeli authorities have designated as state land about 788,000 dunams, excluding East Jerusalem but including about 100,000 dunams currently in Areas A and B.[[726]] The remaining roughly 600,000 dunams of state land it holds, including about 70,00 dunams currently in Areas A and B, consists of land that Jordanian or British authorities registered as state land during their respective reigns over the West Bank and which Israel took control of in 1967.[[727]] \nIsraeli authorities have issued hundreds of eviction orders against Palestinians they claim are “illegally holding” state land.[[728]] The Israeli rights groups Kerem Navot and Haqel found, based on a review of more than 600 eviction orders issued against Palestinians between 2005 and 2018, that 41.5 percent of the territory encompassed by the orders had not formally been declared by authorities as state land.[[729]] \nOf the more than 675,000 dunams of state land that Israeli authorities have officially allocated for third parties in the West Bank, they have earmarked more than 99 percent to serve the needs of Israeli civilians.[[730]] \nBeyond what they deem state land, Israeli authorities have confiscated tens of thousands of dunams of land they acknowledge to be privately owned by Palestinians. Peace Now, based on data provided by the Israeli government, found in 2007 that more than 30 percent of the land located within settlements is privately-owned Palestinian land, by the Israeli government’s own accounting.[[731]] In addition, the Israeli rights group Kerem Navot estimates that more than 40 percent of the roughly 55,000 dunams of land outside the jurisdiction of settlement municipalities, that settlers use for agricultural activity, is acknowledged to be private Palestinian land.[[732]] \nIsraeli authorities have relied on two primary legal tools to carry out confiscations of acknowledged private Palestinian property. First, authorities have expropriated land for public use, permanently stripping Palestinian landowners of their rights to it in return for some compensation.[[733]] Second, the Israeli army, particularly during the first 12 years of its occupation, seized privately owned land in the West Bank for security purposes. These seizure orders did not change the title to the land, premised as they were on the assumption that the occupation is temporary. But while continuing to list the confiscated land as belonging to its Palestinian owners, Israeli authorities gave it to Israeli civilians while sharply restricting its Palestinian owners and their heirs from accessing it. Kerem Navot determined based on a review of more than 1,000 seizure orders that, between 1967 and 2014, Israeli authorities seized on security grounds more than 100,000 dunams of land, most of it privately owned by Palestinians, for settlements or infrastructure intended in significant part to serve the needs of settlers.[[734]] Most of the confiscations took place before 1979 when the Israeli Supreme Court restricted the authority of the army to give to settlements privately owned land that it had seized on security grounds.[[735]] Since that decision, though, authorities with few exceptions have not returned to their Palestinian owners lands they seized and allocated to settlements prior to the court decision.\nIn addition, settlers have established settlements without any formal process or authorization from the Israeli military authorities, largely on the private property of Palestinians. Rather than demolish the buildings that settlers constructed on stolen land without permits, however, the authorities have, with a few notable exceptions, facilitated the land takeover by providing infrastructure, water, electricity, and other services.[[736]] One hundred and fifty of such so-called outposts have been established across the West Bank since 1991, according to B’Tselem and Kerem Navot.[[737]] Peace Now has documented 60 outposts established since 2012 alone.[[738]] Israeli authorities retroactively granted legal status to 15 outposts between 2012 and early 2019,[[739]] and Netanyahu has indicated that he intends to annex and incorporate outposts into Israel.[[740]] \nIn February 2017, the Knesset passed a law allowing authorities to retroactively expropriate private Palestinian land on which settlements have been built. In June 2020, however, the Supreme Court struck it down as unconstitutional,[[741]] finding that “less harmful tools” could achieve similar ends. These include a military order cited by the attorney-general in a submission to the court that recognizes as valid deals made in “good faith,” where authorities reasonably believed at the time of sale that the land was not privately owned by Palestinians.[[742]] Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit began to cite this order in 2018 as a basis to legalize outposts,[[743]] and estimated at the time that this mechanism would offer a pathway to formalizing the status of 80 percent of the remaining areas within settlements that do not have legal status.[[744]] \nIsraeli military records show other parcels of land as sold by Palestinians to Israeli settlement entities. In many cases, though, settlers’ claims to the land they bought rely on dubious documents or sellers not legally entitled to sell the land in question, creating fraudulent sales.[[745]] Even in cases in which Palestinian landowners genuinely sell land they owned to a settlement, such a transaction might involve duress because Israeli authorities fully or partially prevented the Palestinian owners from making use of the land before they sold it.\nIsraeli authorities have also expropriated from Palestinians nearly one-third of the land in East Jerusalem, comprising at least 23,378 dunams according to B’Tselem, largely to build settlements.[[746]] Owners of expropriated land in East Jerusalem, as in the West Bank, can officially claim compensation, but many Palestinian owners do not seek it so as not to legitimize the expropriation.[[747]] \nBeyond reclassifying land status, Israeli authorities have used other mechanisms to take control of land. First, they have declared close to 1.765 million dunams of land, almost one-third of the entire West Bank, as “closed military areas” as of March 2015, according to figures obtained by Kerem Navot.[[748]] More than two-thirds of closed military areas, a category that includes both designated state land and acknowledged private Palestinian land, fall outside the formal jurisdiction of settlement municipalities. Kerem Navot found that of the more than half the land in these closed military areas that were closed ostensibly to be used for military training 78 percent is not actually used for training.[[749]] Second, the Israeli army has issued formal no-construction orders, primarily along roads and parts of the separation barrier, on more than 488,600 dunams of Palestinian land in the West Bank, as documented by Kerem Navot.[[750]] \nLand grabs and restrictions confine the nearly 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank to densely populated enclaves. Israel maintains full control over the majority of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem and Area C. In Areas A and B, where Palestinians have a limited degree of self-rule and which comprises the remaining roughly 40 percent of the West Bank excluding East Jerusalem, it concentrates Palestinians, according to B’Tselem, into “165 non-contiguous ‘territorial islands.’”[[751]] \nThe mass confiscation of Palestinian land and restrictions that block Palestinians from recovering what authorities seized from them or using their lands amount to the inhumane act of “expropriation of landed property” under the Apartheid Convention.[[752]] The boxing of Palestinians into densely populated enclaves constitutes measures “designed to divide the population along racial lines by the creation of separate reserves and ghettos.”[[753]] \n![] \nIsraeli authorities built the separation barrier around the Palestinian city of Qalqilya in the occupied West Bank in 2003, constraining the movement of its residents and restricting their access to the half of their agricultural lands located on the other side of the barrier. Landsat-5 imagery courtesy of the U.S. Geological Survey. 2021.### Forcible Transfer and the Right to Residence (Area C of the West Bank and East Jerusalem)\nIsraeli authorities have made it virtually impossible for Palestinians to obtain building permits in East Jerusalem and in the 60 percent of the West Bank under its exclusive control (Area C), effectively forcing Palestinians in need of housing or space to establish a business to leave these areas or to build at the risk of seeing their “unauthorized” structures bulldozed.[[754]] More than 371,000 Palestinians live in East Jerusalem,[[755]] while an estimated 300,000 Palestinians reside in Area C.[[756]] Israel exercises complete control over planning procedures and construction in these areas and effectively prevents building outside built-up areas, constituting less than one percent of Area C and 15 percent of East Jerusalem (8.5 percent of the Jerusalem municipality), which are in many cases already densely populated,[[757]] in order to maximize Jewish Israeli control over the land as documented in previous chapters of this report.[[758]] \nIsraeli authorities refuse the vast majority of requests by Palestinians to upgrade or build homes, schools, health clinics, wells, water cisterns, animal pens, or other structures. Between 2016 and 2018, Israeli authorities approved less than 1.5 percent of applications for Palestinians to build in Area C, 21 applications in total, while issuing 2,147 demolition orders, according to data obtained from the Israeli Civil Administration by Bimkom.[[759]] In other words, it issued 100 times more demolition orders than building permits in this period. Since 2000, it has approved less than four percent of all building requests from Palestinians in Area C,[[760]] and many Palestinians have stopped bothering to even apply for them.[[761]] Meanwhile, Israeli authorities between 2000 and 2018 approved on average fewer than 400 construction permits a year for Palestinians in East Jerusalem.[[762]] \nLargely for lacking a permit, Israeli authorities have razed thousands of Palestinian properties. They have also demolished Palestinian homes as punishment imposed on those accused of attacking Israelis and as collective punishment of their families.[[763]] From 2009 through 2020, Israeli authorities demolished 7,118 structures in East Jerusalem and Area C, displacing 10,493 people, according to OCHA.[[764]] B’Tselem documented that Israeli authorities fully demolished in this same period 2,319 homes throughout the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, for lacking a building permit, leaving 9,053 people displaced.[[765]] Israel has not offered resettlement options or compensation to families whose homes it demolished. Israeli authorities also carried out 84 punitive home demolitions during this period, acts that left 345 people without a home, according to B’Tselem.[[766]] International humanitarian law prohibits an occupying power from destroying property unless “absolutely necessary” for “military operations” and prohibits all acts that constitute collective punishment.[[767]] \nThese coercive policies affect many more Palestinians living in these areas, who face demolition orders and the prospect that authorities could at any time raze their homes. According to Israeli government data obtained by Bimkom, the Israeli government carried out about 21 percent of the more than 18,600 demolition orders it issued in the West Bank, not including East Jerusalem, between 1995 and March 2020.[[768]] As of April 2021, the UN considered 46 Palestinian communities in the West Bank at “high-risk of forcible transfer due to a ‘relocation’ plan advanced by the Israeli authorities.”[[769]] \nThese policies create a coercive environment that pressures Palestinians to leave East Jerusalem and Area C. By making it exceedingly difficult to remain, Israeli policies induce Palestinians in these communities to abandon their homes and livelihoods and relocate, usually to towns or cities under the administrative and civil control of the PA. Peace Now estimates that, although Palestinians constitute 90 percent of the population of the Jordan Valley, Israel effectively restricts them from building on about 94 percent of the territory.[[770]] According to OCHA, between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2020, Israel demolished 2,601 Palestinian structures in the Jordan Valley for lacking a permit, displacing 3,716 people and affecting 23,464 others.[[771]] More than 250,000 Palestinians lived in the Jordan Valley before 1967.[[772]] Between 50,000 and 200,000 of them fled to Jordan during the 1967 War.[[773]] Today, the population stands between 60,000 and 80,000.[[774]] \nCoercive policies have particularly affected Palestinian communities in the Jordan Valley, around Jerusalem, and in the South Hebron Hills.[[775]] In many of these areas, Israeli authorities have blocked residents, including Bedouin and herding communities, from accessing roads and agricultural lands, failed to provide electricity, sewage, water, and other utilities, and rejected their applications for such services. Many of these communities also have no reliable access to water sources and have to spend up to one-sixth of their income to purchase water from small, portable water tankers. These restrictions often result in children walking long distances for school and leaving residents with limited access to health care.[[776]] \nIn addition, Israel has directly deported more than 1,500 Palestinians out of the OPT, largely before 1993, only some of whom they have permitted to return.[[777]] \nIsrael’s coercive policies in East Jerusalem and Area C of the West Bank amount to intentional forcible transfer of civilians within an occupied territory, defined as “the movement of individuals under duress from where they reside to a place that is not of their choosing,”[[778]] a grave breach of the laws of war. The Rome Statute states that forcible transfer can occur “directly or indirectly,” through coercive circumstances as well as direct force,[[779]] and defines it, when carried out in a widespread or systematic manner, as a state policy, as a crime against humanity and one of the kinds of inhumane acts that make up the crime of apartheid.[[780]] The Israeli policies in these areas, which have coerced thousands to leave their homes and put tens of thousands more at risk, amount to forcible transfer under the terms of the Rome Statute. By denying building permits for houses, schools, clinics, and infrastructure and demolishing homes and entire areas, these policies suffocate communities and constitute “the deliberate creation of conditions preventing the[ir] full development.”[[781]] \n### Denial of Residency and Nationality\nIsraeli authorities have denied millions of Palestinians the right to residency and nationality through its control over population registries, the granting of legal status and residency rights, and entry and exit to Israel and the OPT.\n#### West Bank and Gaza\nIsraeli policies on Palestinian residency have arbitrarily denied hundreds of thousands of Palestinians the ability to live in, and travel to and from, the West Bank and Gaza. Israeli restrictions on residency separate families, bar thousands from returning to their homes in the OPT, trap others inside their homes or parts of the OPT, and block others from pursuing educational or economic opportunities.[[782]] \nIsraeli authorities have primarily done so through their ongoing control of the population registry—the list of Palestinians whom authorities consider lawful residents of the OPT. Israel requires Palestinians to be included in the population registry to obtain Israeli-sanctioned identification cards and passports, which allow Palestinians to reside, work, and inherit property, but do not convey citizenship or nationality. Israeli security forces manning checkpoints require Palestinians to present an identification card before allowing passage for travel within the OPT, including to schools, jobs, hospitals or to visit family.[[783]] Egyptian authorities also require Palestinians to present an identification card or passport to enter or exit via the Rafah crossing.[[784]] \nIsraeli authorities base the population registry on a census it conducted in the West Bank and Gaza in September 1967, several months after it took control of these areas. The census counted 954,898 Palestinians as physically present,[[785]] but excluded at least 270,000 Palestinians who had been living there before 1967, but were absent during the census, either because they had fled during the 1967 war or were abroad for study, work, or other reasons.[[786]] Israeli authorities did not include these Palestinians in the population registry, requiring them to obtain visitor permits to return to their homes and denying entry to many, including all men aged 16 to 60, during the early years of the occupation.[[787]] Israeli authorities set up a restrictive family reunification process that operated until 2000 based on low annual quotas and subject to arbitrary and evolving criteria that failed to take into account genuine familial or historical ties.[[788]] \nBetween 1967 and 1994, Israeli authorities struck from the registry thousands of Palestinians who traveled and stayed abroad for long periods. During this period, it permanently canceled the registry of 140,000 registered Palestinians, solely because they left the West Bank for a period of more than three years, according to data from the Office of the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), the Israeli army body in charge of administering the occupied West Bank. Authorities also during this same period revoked the residency of 108,878 Palestinians from Gaza either for staying abroad for more than seven years or for not being present during censuses conducted in 1981 and 1988.[[789]] A survey conducted in 2005, on behalf of B’Tselem, estimated that more than 640,000 Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza had a parent, sibling, child, or spouse who was unregistered, even though 78.4 percent of them had filed a family reunification request that had not yet been processed.[[790]] \nSoon after its establishment, the PA in 1995 took on the task of handling requests to update the population registry or apply for residency, but its role consists of transferring those requests to the Israeli side for approval.[[791]] Since 2000, Israeli authorities have for the most part refused to update the population registry or process applications for residency by unregistered Palestinians, their spouses, and close relatives, even if they had lived in the West Bank or Gaza for years and had families, homes, jobs, or other ties there.[[792]] Israel entirely froze the “family reunification” process by which Palestinians apply to grant legal status to join immediate relatives or spouses not registered in the population registry.[[793]] Israeli authorities have cited the security situation following the outbreak of the second*Intifada*as the rationale for the freeze,[[794]] but they have not explained why their blanket refusal to process new applications is necessary for security reasons. They simply refuse to process any new application without an explanation or to review whether the particular individual presents a security threat.\nThe freeze has remained in place since 2000, outside of processing about 35,000 family unification applications in the late 2000s as a “diplomatic gesture” to the PA.[[795]] The PA’s Civil Affairs Ministry estimated that, between September 2000 and August 2005 alone, it relayed more than 120,000 applications for family reunification that Israeli authorities did not process.[[796]] The Israeli Supreme Court opted in 2019 not to force the army to end its freeze, following a challenge by the Israeli rights group HaMoked.[[797]] The two-decade-old freeze has meant that Israeli authorities have stopped registering most categories of people, with the exception of children who had at least one registered Palestinian parent.\nIsraeli authorities have also systematically barred entry to Israel and the West Bank over the last two decades of non-registered Palestinians who lived or used to live in the West Bank and their non-registered spouses and other family members.[[798]] \nIsrael’s refusal to update the population registry has applied even to requests to change addresses, which made the presence of Palestinians living in the West Bank, but registered in Gaza, illegal.[[799]] Most entered the West Bank on temporary permits, which have long since expired. In 2010, the Israeli army estimated that at that time around 35,000 Palestinians from Gaza were living in the West Bank with expired permits.[[800]] Israeli law considers Palestinians with expired permits as unlawful “infiltrators,”[[801]] and authorities have removed dozens back to Gaza.[[802]] Those who remain cannot freely move within the West Bank, fearing arrest at checkpoints and forcible return to Gaza, and often face difficulties registering at schools or universities, doing business, or owning property.\nIsrael’s policies that deny Palestinians in the OPT the ability to live in or travel to the areas they are from deny them “the right to freedom of movement and residency,” one of the inhumane acts set out in the Apartheid Convention.\n#### East Jerusalem\nIsraeli policies have also denied residency rights to thousands of Palestinians in East Jerusalem and left many without nationality. Since its annexation of East Jerusalem in 1967, it has applied its 1952 Law of Entry to Palestinians from there and designated them as “permanent residents,” the same status afforded to a foreigner who wants to live in Israel. Permanent residents may live, work, and receive benefits, but that status derives from their presence, can be revoked at the Interior Ministry’s discretion, and does not automatically pass to one’s children or non-resident spouse even if they have lived in Jerusalem for years.[[803]] A path to citizenship exists for Palestinian Jerusalemite permanent residents, but the vast majority have chosen not to pursue it, as it involves recognizing Israel, the occupying power, as the legitimate sovereign. The vast majority of those who applied did not receive citizenship. Authorities rejected many applicants for failing to demonstrate that Israel, and not the West Bank, was their “center of life,” or for their having a criminal record, insufficient knowledge of Hebrew, or “lack of loyalty [to Israel].” Others never received a response to their applications.[[804]] \nBetween the start of Israel’s occupation of East Jerusalem in 1967 and the end of 2020, Israel revoked the permanent resident status of at least 14,701 Palestinians from East Jerusalem.[[805]] Authorities have justified most revocations based on a failure to prove a “center of life” in Jerusalem, targeting those it said had been living in other parts of the OPT outside Jerusalem’s municipal borders or who had studied or lived abroad for extended periods of time. Others lost their residency after obtaining permanent residency or citizenship in another country. The number of revocations has dropped since 2015 when the Interior Ministry said it would adopt “a more lenient approach” that would maintain the residency of Palestinian Jerusalemites who “maintain a connection” to the city.”[[806]] Authorities have, though, in recent years revoked status to punish Palestinians accused of attacking Israelis and as an act of collective punishment against their relatives.[[807]] \nEach revocation often has a much wider impact, as the families of persons who lose their status often accompany them as they leave the city, and other Palestinians have to adjust their lives to safeguard their precarious status. Palestinians from East Jerusalem have told Human Rights Watch that the fear of losing this status weighs on their daily life, determining where families live and deterring them from pursuing educational and professional opportunities abroad.[[808]] By pushing Palestinians to leave their home city, residency revocations amount to forcible transfer.[[809]] \nIsraeli law authorizes arrest and deportation for those found without legal status. Without that status, Palestinians cannot formally work, move freely, renew driver’s licenses, or obtain birth certificates for children, which are needed to register them in school. They could also lose benefits under Israel’s national insurance program, which provides social welfare benefits, such as healthcare, unemployment benefits, and support payments for children, the elderly, and people with disabilities. Those who lose their residency can petition the Interior Ministry to recover their status, during which time they can obtain a temporary status to remain in Jerusalem. Some Palestinians have succeeded in reinstating their status, but only after protracted legal and administrative processes that many cannot afford.[[810]] \nIn a March 2017 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that Palestinians from East Jerusalem enjoy “special status” as “native residents” that authorities should account for in determining their status.[[811]] But Israeli policy continues to fail to do that in practice.\n### Mass Suspension of Civil Rights (West Bank, Gaza)\nIsraeli authorities have deprived generations of Palestinians in the OPT of their basic civil rights, including the rights to free assembly, association, and expression. In particular, authorities have targeted Palestinians for their anti-occupation speech, activism, and affiliations, jailing thousands, outlawing hundreds of political and non-government organizations, and shutting down dozens of media outlets.[[812]] \nIn the West Bank, the army continues to rely on draconian military orders issued in the early days of the occupation to criminalize non-violent political activity. Authorities, for example, continue to apply British Mandate-era regulations that allow them to declare unlawful groups that advocate “bringing into hatred or contempt of, or the exciting of disaffection against” local authorities and to arrest Palestinians for affiliation with such groups.[[813]] As of March 2020, the Israeli Defense Ministry maintained formal bans against 430 organizations, including the Palestine Liberation Organization that Israel signed a peace accord with, its ruling Fatah party, and all the other major Palestinian political parties.[[814]] The army prosecuted 1,704 Palestinians in the West Bank for “membership and activity in an unlawful association” between July 1, 2014, and June 30, 2019, according to data it provided Human Rights Watch.[[815]] \nIn addition, the army regularly uses military orders permitting it to shut down unlicensed protests or to create closed military zones to suppress peaceful Palestinian demonstrations in the West Bank and detain participants.[[816]] One military order, for example, imposes a prison term of up to 10 years on civilians convicted by military courts for participating in a gathering of more than 10 people without a military permit on any issue “that could be construed as political” or for displaying “flags or political symbols” without army approval.[[817]] The Israeli army said that, in the five-year period between July 1, 2014, and June 30, 2019, it prosecuted 4,590 West Bank Palestinians for entering a “closed military zone,”[[818]] a designation often used for protest sites.\nThe army has further cited the broad definition of incitement in its military laws, defined to include “praise, sympathy or support for a hostile organization” and “attempts, orally or otherwise, to influence public opinion in the Area in a manner which may harm public peace or public order,” to criminalize speech merely opposing its occupation.[[819]] The army acknowledged prosecuting 358 Palestinians in the West Bank for “incitement” between mid-2014 and mid-2019.[[820]] \nWhile the law of occupation permits occupiers to restrict some civil and political rights based on limited security justifications, the decades-long mass suspension of basic civil rights for Palestinians in the OPT with no end in sight amounts to measures “calculated to prevent” their “participation in the political, social, economic and cultural life” and create “conditions preventing the[ir] full development” by denying them the rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly, and association, specifically identified in the Apartheid Convention.[[821]] When the sweeping restrictions result in unlawful arrests, they also constitute a denial of the right of liberty by virtue of “arbitrary arrest and illegal imprisonment” under the Apartheid Convention.\n## Other Abuses in Israel\nSeparately from the inhumane acts committed in the OPT, the Israeli government has carried out other abuses against Palestinians within its pre-1967 borders.\n### Land Expropriation and Restrictions\nBeginning in 1948 and in subsequent decades, Israeli authorities seized several million dunams of land from Palestinians inside Israel. Many of the most serious abuses described in this subsection, involving the massive confiscation of land from Palestinian citizens of Israel, occurred between 1948 and 1966. While the plight of Palestinians in Israel has generally improved since the lifting in 1966 of the martial law that Israeli authorities imposed on them for the first 17 years of the country’s history, these violations are continuing insofar as many of the victims remain unable to recover what authorities seized from them, return to live in the villages they came from, or obtain compensation for the losses they experienced.\nA precise figure of the amount of land confiscated from Palestinians in Israel is not available, in part as a result of the different forms of land ownership under Ottoman law and the lack of formal registration of much of the land in the land registry before 1948.[[822]] The pre-eminent historians of the era, though, largely estimate that Israeli authorities confiscated at least 4.5 million dunams of land from Palestinians, constituting an estimated 65 to 75 percent of all land owned by Palestinians before 1948, including 40 to 60 percent of the land belonging to Palestinians who remained and became Israeli citizens.[[823]] Some historians also estimate that of the 370 Jewish towns and villages established by the Israeli government between 1948 and 1953, 350 were built on land confiscated from Palestinians.[[824]] Much of the confiscation took place between 1949 and 1966. During these years Israel subjected most Palestinians in Israel to military rule, confined them to dozens of enclaves, and severely restricted their movement.*Haaretz*reported, based on declassified government documents, that Israeli officials lifted military rule in 1966 only after they had ensured that internally displaced Palestinians “could not return to the villages they had fled or been expelled from.”[[825]] \nIsraeli authorities used principally two mechanisms to seize land belonging to Palestinians in Israel. First, in 1950, the Knesset, building on emergency regulations issued in December 1948 to authorize land confiscations, passed the Absentees’ Property Law that allowed the state to confiscate the land and homes of Palestinians not present on their property in 1947 and 1948 amid the fighting in the events surrounding the establishment of Israel and who had fled or were expelled to one of several neighboring or nearby Arab countries or to “any part of Palestine outside the area of Israel,” including those places “in Palestine held at the time by forces which sought to prevent the establishment of the State of Israel or which fought against it after its establishment.”[[826]] Israeli authorities applied the law to take hold of most of the land belonging to the hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees who came to reside outside of Israel, as well as land belonging to Palestinians internally displaced as a result of the events of 1947 and 1948. Israeli authorities placed the land under the control of the Custodian for Absentees’ Property and eventually converted it to state land, almost exclusively used to build new Jewish communities.[[827]] Israeli authorities have also used the Absentees’ Property Law to take control of land belonging to Palestinians in occupied East Jerusalem.[[828]] \nSecond, the Israeli government declared many Palestinian towns and villages, particularly those outside the enclaves that Palestinians lived in during the period of military rule, as “closed areas.” It then passed in 1953 the Land Acquisition Law, which, building on a prior emergency regulation, permitted the state to take ownership of land uncultivated since 1948. It also allowed the state to take over land in those cases where it did not recognize claims of ownership filed by Palestinians, even if the land was under cultivation. The rights group Adalah estimates that the Israeli government seized 1.2-1.3 million dunams of land under the Land Acquisition Law.[[829]] The law offered compensation, but largely in the form of “alternative plots that were either uncultivable or belonged to refugees in exile,” as one historian wrote, or compensation based on rates so low that Israel’s then-Foreign Minister and later Prime Minister Moshe Sharett referred to them as a “scandalous robbery.”[[830]] \nIn a 2005 report, the Global IDP Project of the Norwegian Refugee Council estimated based on a review of a range of sources that there were at the time between 150,000 and 300,000 Palestinians in Israel internally displaced from the events surrounding the establishment of Israel.[[831]] The UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR) found in 1998 that most of what they estimated to be around 200,000 internally displaced Palestinians, who they refer to as “present absentees,” continue to be displaced and dispossessed within the State because their lands were confiscated and not returned to them.”[[832]] \nIsraeli authorities continue to block Palestinian citizen landowners from accessing or using land that they confiscated from them.[[833]] For example, in November 1948, Israeli forces expelled residents from the village of Iqrit, near the Lebanon border, after fighting in the area had largely ended and soon after declaring Iqrit a closed military area.[[834]] Residents, most of whom remained internally displaced inside Israel, filed a legal challenge against their displacement and, in 1951, the Israeli Supreme Court ruled that residents should be allowed to return to their homes.[[835]] However, before the order could be carried out and two months before another Supreme Court hearing on the case, the army blew up all the houses still standing in the village.[[836]] Residents have continued to seek to return, but the government has continued to block them, claiming in the 1960s, for example, that return would constitute a security risk.[[837]] In 2003, the Israeli Supreme Court rejected a new petition by residents to return, determining the issue to be “political” and therefore deferring to the government, which had determined that permitting Iqrit residents to return would “harm the country’s important interests.”[[838]] The court, though, noted that residents were entitled to either compensation or allocation of an alternative parcel of land, conditions the residents had previously refused.[[839]] \nLand confiscations and discriminatory land and housing policies have created a situation where the majority of Palestinian citizens of Israel, who make up around 19 percent of Israel’s population,[[840]] live in crowded Palestinian municipalities, which have jurisdiction over less than three percent of all land in Israel.[[841]] \n### Coercive Practices in the Negev Region\nIsraeli authorities have also in some instances used coercive practices to restrict the rights of Palestinian citizens of Israel. They have, for example, made it virtually impossible for tens of thousands of Palestinian Bedouins residing in the Negev to live lawfully in the communities they have lived in for decades.[[842]] Dating back to the formulation of the state’s first formal plans in the 1960s, authorities have refused to legally recognize 35 Bedouin communities in the Negev, forcing their 90,000 or so residents, constituting more than 28 percent of the Bedouin population in the Negev, to live under constant threat of demolition.[[843]] Israeli law considers all buildings in these unrecognized villages illegal and authorities have refused to connect most to the national electricity or water grids or provide basic infrastructure, such as paved roads or sewage systems.[[844]] The communities do not appear on official maps, most have no educational facilities or basic infrastructure, and, without recognized addresses, residents cannot register to participate in local elections.[[845]] \nIsraeli authorities have demolished thousands of Bedouin homes, many consisting of no more than tents or shacks, over the course of decades. According to government data, between 2013 and 2019, 10,697 structures belonging to Palestinian Bedouins were demolished in the Negev, including 2,241 in 2019 alone, the majority by owners themselves in the face of demolition orders and under threat of significant penalty.[[846]] Israeli authorities have razed one unrecognized village that has been embroiled in a years-long legal battle with the state, al-Araqib, 185 times.[[847]] In a 2007 letter to Human Rights Watch, the Justice Ministry said it considered there to be 45,000 illegal structures in the Negev at that time.[[848]] \nFor years, authorities have sought to concentrate Bedouins living in the Negev in government-planned townships in order to maximize the land available for Jewish communities.[[849]] Many Bedouins, though, see the development of these townships as an effort to extinguish their land claims elsewhere in the Negev and do not view them as acceptable residential options, given their lack of involvement in their development and concerns about overcrowding and government neglect.[[850]] Those efforts continue; according to the rights group Adalah, a 2019 government plan would displace 36,000 Bedouins in order to expand military training areas and establish “economic development” projects.[[851]] \n### Denial of Residency and Nationality\n#### Effective Ban on Granting Status to Palestinian Spouses from the OPT\nIsrael’s Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law (Temporary Order)—2003 bars Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza from residing with their spouse in Israel or East Jerusalem.[[852]] The temporary order, enacted by the Knesset in July 2003, renewed every year since and upheld by the Israeli Supreme Court, prohibits with few exceptions the granting of residency or citizenship to Palestinian ID holders, even if married to an Israeli citizen or permanent resident.[[853]] While Israeli authorities already restricted family reunification before 2003, this law has brought the process to a near halt.[[854]] \nThe law denies Israeli citizens and residents, both Jewish and Palestinian, who marry Palestinian residents of the West Bank and Gaza the right enjoyed by other Israelis to live with their loved ones in the place of their choosing. This denial is based on the spouse’s ethnicity rather than on an individualized assessment of security risk. If an Israeli marries a foreign spouse who is Jewish, the spouse can obtain citizenship automatically. Other foreigners can receive immediate status and normally become eligible for citizenship after living in Israel for several years.[[855]] Palestinian men over 35 and women over 25 from the West Bank and Gaza married to Israeli citizens or residents can apply for temporary, renewable visitor permits, but authorities have denied many of those applications.[[856]] \nThe law forces a difficult choice for the thousands of couples—30,000 where one spouse is a Palestinian citizen of Israel, according to the Mossawa Center—who marry despite these restrictions. They must either live separately or have the Israeli citizen or resident spouse move to the West Bank, despite Israeli military orders prohibiting Israelis from living in Area A.[[857]] Moreover, moving to the OPT has led Palestinian Jerusalemites to lose their residency status and jeopardizes the eligibility of both Israeli citizens and residents to exercise rights related to residency or citizenship such as the right to receive social security benefits. This difficult choice has splintered thousands of families.[[858]] \n#### Palestinian Refugees\nIsrael’s Citizenship Law of 1952 denies citizenship and residency rights to the more than 700,000 Palestinians who resided before 1948 in the territory that is now Israel and who fled or were expelled during the events of 1948, and to their descendants.[[859]] Restrictive Israeli policies also block refugees from neighboring countries from legally residing even in the OPT.[[860]] International human rights law guarantees to refugees and exiles the right to enter the territory they are from, even where sovereignty is contested or has changed hands, and reside in areas where they or their families once lived and have maintained links to.[[861]] Like refugees in other contexts, Palestinian refugees should be given the opportunity to freely decide between returning to their country of origin, local integration, or third-country resettlement.[[862]] The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) has registered 5.7 million Palestinian refugees.[[863]] Many remain stateless and have lived for generations in crowded refugee camps in poor conditions in the OPT, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria.[[864]] \n## Conclusion\nIsraeli authorities have deprived millions of people of their basic rights by virtue of their identity as Palestinians. These longstanding policies and systematic practices box in, dispossess, forcibly separate, marginalize, and otherwise inflict suffering on Palestinians.\nIn the OPT, movement restrictions, land expropriation, forcible transfer, denial of residency and nationality, and the mass suspension of civil rights constitute “inhuman[e] acts” set out under the Apartheid Convention and the Rome Statute. Under both legal standards, inhumane acts when carried out amid systematic oppression and with the intent to maintain domination make up the crime against humanity of apartheid.[[865]] \nCollectively, these policies and practices in the OPT severely deprive Palestinians of fundamental human rights, including to residency, private property, and access to land, services, and resources, on a widespread and systematic basis. When committed with discriminatory intent, on the basis of the victims’ identity as part of a group or collectivity, they amount to the crime against humanity of persecution under the Rome Statute and customary international law.\nSeparately from the inhumane acts carried out in the OPT, the Israeli government violates the rights of Palestinians inside Israel on account of their identity, including measures that have made it virtually impossible for tens of thousands of Palestinian Bedouins living in the Negev to live lawfully in the communities; the denial to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians of the ability to access or use land confiscated from them historically; the effective bar on citizens and residents obtaining long-term legal status to and thereby living permanently together in Israel with spouses from the West Bank and Gaza,******which deprives them of the ability to live together permanentlyin Israel; and the denial of residency rights to Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes in the events around the establishment of the state.\nThese abuses continue and there is no indication that authorities have investigated, much less held accountable, anyone involved in their commission.\n# Recommendations\nThese recommendations stem from Human Rights Watch’s finding that Israeli authorities are committing the crimes against humanity of apartheid and persecution.\nHuman Rights Watch found that the Israeli government has pursued an intent to maintain the domination of Jewish Israelis over Palestinians throughout the territory it controls. In the OPT, including East Jerusalem, that intent has been coupled with systematic oppression of Palestinians and inhumane acts committed against them. When these three elements occur together, they amount to the crime of apartheid.\nIsraeli authorities are also committing the crime against humanity of persecution based on the discriminatory intent behind Israel’s treatment of Palestinians and the grave abuses it has carried out in the OPT.\n## To the State of Israel\n* Dismantle all forms of systematic oppression and discrimination that privilege Jewish Israelis at the expense of Palestinians and otherwise systematically violate Palestinian rights in order to ensure the dominance of Jewish Israelis, and end the persecution of Palestinians, including by ending discriminatory policies and practices in such realms as citizenship and nationality processes, protection of civil rights, freedom of movement, allocation of land and resources, access to water, electricity, and other services, and granting of building permits.\n* Fully respect the human rights of Palestinians, including those in the OPT, as well as the protections owed to Palestinians in the OPT under international humanitarian law. * Cease construction and expansion of settlements, dismantle existing settlements, and bring Israeli citizens inhabiting settlements in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, back within Israel’s internationally-recognized borders.\n* End the generalized ban on travel to and from Gaza and permit the free movement of people to and from Gaza, and in particular between Gaza and the West Bank, and abroad, subject to, at most, individual screenings and physical searches for security purposes.\n* Permit Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza to move freely into East Jerusalem, subject to, at most, individual screenings and physical searches for security purposes.\n* End discrimination in the application of planning, permit, and building laws and regulations that subject Palestinians to discriminatory permit refusals and demolition orders.\n* Provide equitable access to land, housing, and essential services for Palestinians.\n* Dismantle the segments of the Separation Barrier not built along the Green Line but, rather, inside the OPT.\n* Repeal discriminatory laws and legal provisions in favor of legislation that is rooted in the principle of equality and conforms to international human rights standards, including:\n* The Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law (Temporary Order)—2003, which allows Israeli citizens and residents to obtain legal status for their non-Israeli spouses, but not if the spouses are Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza, who are explicitly ineligible under this law with few exceptions;\n* Provisions in the 2011 Admission Commissions Law that effectively allow discrimination by residents of small towns inside Israel against prospective residents on the basis of their race, ethnicity, or national origin;\n* Provisions in the Basic Law: Israel as the Nation-State of the Jewish People that discriminate between Jews and non-Jews with regard to the right to self-determination and to housing.\n* Remove arbitrary restrictions on residency rights for Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip and their families, including by stopping the practice of revoking the residency of Palestinians in East Jerusalem, ending the effective freeze on family reunification applications in the West Bank and Gaza since 2000, and allowing Palestinians to resettle in other parts of the OPT and register their new addresses.\n* Recognize and honor the right of Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes in 1948 and their descendants to enter Israel and reside in the areas where they or their families once lived, as Human Rights Watch has outlined in a separate policy, which also outlines the options of integration in place or in the OPT and resettlement elsewhere.[[866]] \n* Cooperate with and heed the recommendations of UN bodies and human rights mechanisms.\n* Ratify the Rome Statute and incorporate crimes against humanity, including the crimes of persecution and apartheid, into national criminal law with a view to investigate and prosecute individuals credibly implicated in these crimes.## To the Palestinian Liberation Organization\n* Adopt an advocacy strategy centered on the immediate attainment of the full human rights of Palestinians, rather than one that puts off attainment of human rights in favor of a particular political outcome.## To the Palestinian Authority\n* Cease all security coordination with the Israeli army that contributes to facilitating the crimes of apartheid and persecution in the OPT.\n* Incorporate crimes against humanity, including the crimes of persecution and apartheid, into national criminal law.## To the International Criminal Court Office of the Prosecutor\n* Investigate and prosecute individuals credibly implicated in the crimes against humanity of apartheid or persecution.## To Members of the United Nations\n* Establish through the UN an international commission of inquiry to investigate systematic discrimination and repression based on group identity in the OPT and Israel. The inquiry should be mandated to establish and analyze the facts, and, where applicable, identify those responsible for serious crimes, including apartheid and persecution, with a view to ensure that the perpetrators of violations are held accountable, as well as collect and preserve evidence related to abuses for future use by credible judicial institutions.

Explosions also rang out in nearby oil-producing [Gulf Arab countries], which said they had intercepted missiles from Iran after Tehran warned it would strike the region if it was attacked.\n\nSign up [here.] \n\nThe first wave of strikes in what the Pentagon named \"OPERATION EPIC FURY\" mainly targeted Iranian officials, a source familiar with the matter said.\n\nAn Israeli official said Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Masoud Pezeshkian were both targeted but the result of the strikes was not clear. A source with knowledge of the matter had earlier told Reuters that Khamenei was not in Tehran and had been transferred to a secure location.\n\nAn Iranian source close to the establishment said several senior commanders in Iran's Revolutionary Guards and political officials had been killed. Forty people were killed in an Israeli airstrike on a school, state media said. Reuters could not independently confirm the reports.\n\n## HOPES DIM FOR DIPLOMATIC SOLUTION TO NUCLEAR DISPUTE\n\nThe renewed confrontation between Iran and its long-time foes dimmed hopes of a diplomatic solution to Tehran's nuclear dispute with the West. The latest indirect talks between the U.S. and Iran this week failed to produce a breakthrough.\n\nIran's Revolutionary Guards said all [U.S. bases] and interests in the region were within Iran's reach and that the retaliation would continue until \"the enemy is decisively defeated\".\n\nIran's foreign minister told counterparts from Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain and Iraq that Tehran would use all its defensive and military capabilities to defend itself.\n\nLoud booms sounded in the United Arab Emirates capital Abu Dhabi, an oil producer and U.S. ally. Fighter jets flew around the Yas Island area of Abu Dhabi on Saturday afternoon and blasts were heard in the country's business capital Dubai.\n\nBahrain said the service center of the U.S. Fifth Fleet had been subjected to a missile attack. Video footage from witnesses in Bahrain showed a thick grey plume of smoke rising from near the small island state's coastline as sirens wailed.\n\nFellow Gulf Arab state Qatar said it had downed all missiles targeting the country and that it had a right to respond. Sirens were later heard in its capital Doha.\n\nExplosions were heard near Iran's Kharg Island. Iran exports 90 percent of its crude oil via Kharg, for shipping through the narrow Strait of Hormuz.\n\n[Global airlines] cancelled flights across the Middle East and the attacks raised the prospect of oil prices rising.\n\n\"If we don’t see signs of de-escalation over the weekend, risk premiums could still drive Brent (crude) up by $10–$20/bbl (a barrel) on Monday,\" said Jorge Leon, head of geopolitical analysis at Rystad Energy.\n\n## TRUMP CITES 1979 HOSTAGE CRISIS\n\nItem 1 of 11 Smoke rises in the sky after blasts were heard in Manama, Bahrain, February 28, 2026. REUTERS/Stringer\n\n[1/11]Smoke rises in the sky after blasts were heard in Manama, Bahrain, February 28, 2026. REUTERS/Stringer [Purchase Licensing Rights, opens new tab] \n\nIn a video message published on social media, [Trump] cited Washington's decades-old dispute with Iran, including the seizure of the 1979 U.S. embassy in Tehran, when students held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days, as well as a range of other attacks the U.S. has blamed on Iran since the 1979 Islamic revolution brought the clerics to power.\n\nHe urged Iranians to stay sheltered because \"bombs will be dropping everywhere\". But he also added: \"When we are finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take. This will be probably your only chance for generations.”\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the joint U.S.-Israeli attack \"will create the conditions for the brave Iranian people to take their destiny into their own hands\" and \" remove the yoke of tyranny\". Defence Minister Israel Katz called it a pre-emptive strike to remove threats to Israel.\n\nThe scope of the U.S. air and sea operations was not immediately clear. The campaign is expected to last for multiple days, a U.S. official said.\n\nIn Tehran, witnesses said people were rushing to banks to withdraw cash. Long queues formed at gas stations across cities. Many also worried about a potential internet blackout that would cut off communication with their families abroad.\n\n“We are being killed by the regime and by Israel. We are the victims of this regime’s hostile policies,” said Maryam, 54, a [housewife in Tehran], as she headed to northern Iran with her family.\n\nIsrael's military did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the strike at a primary school for girls southern Iran, where Iranian state media reported 40 deaths.\n\nIraq's Iran-aligned armed group Kataib Hezbollah said it would soon attack U.S. bases in the region.\n\n## US MILITARY BUILDUP\n\n[Trump] had built up a vast U.S. military presence in the region to try to force Tehran to make concessions in the nuclear talks. He said the \"massive\" operation was intended to ensure Tehran does not obtain a nuclear weapon.\n\nThe U.S. and Iran renewed negotiations in February on the nuclear dispute. Iran, which denies seeking atomic bombs, said it was prepared to discuss curbs on its nuclear programme in exchange for lifting [sanctions] but ruled out linking the issue to missiles.\n\nIran's ballistic missile programme has been a significant sticking point, with Trump saying Tehran was developing long-range missiles that threaten the U.S.\n\n\"Our objective is to defend the American people by eliminating imminent threats from the Iranian regime,\" Trump said.\n\nThe attacks follows a 12-day air war last June between Israel and Iran and repeated U.S.-Israeli warnings that they would strike again if Iran pressed ahead with its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.\n\nAn Israeli defence official said the operation had been planned for months in coordination with Washington, and that the launch date was decided weeks ago.\n\nThe Israeli military announced the [closure of schools] and workplaces, with exceptions for essential sectors, and a ban on public airspace. Israel closed its airspace to civilian flights.\n\nReporting by Reuters bureaux; Writing by Michael Georgy; Editing by Barbara Lewis, Sam Holmes and Timothy Heritage\n\nOur Standards: [The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles., opens new tab] \n\n[Purchase Licensing Rights] \n\n[Alexander Cornwell] \n\nThomson Reuters\n\nAlexander has over a decade of international reporting experience.

              "reasoning": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user wants me to analyze the provided disciplines (0 to 4) and identify convergent, contradictory, and emergent elements based on the summaries given. \n\nFirst, I need to understand each discipline's perspective. Let me list out the key points from each to see where overlaps and contradictions might be.\n\n**Discipline 0 (Left):** Focuses on Israel's military actions with U.S. support, critiques enabling apartheid and suppression of Palestinian rights. Terms like apartheid, self-determination denial, and Nakba are mentioned. Claims include Australia legitimizing Israel's actions by conflating Iranian regime issues with regional security.\n\n**Discipline 1 (Center-Left):** Highlights joint U.S.-Israel military operations aiming for regime change in Iran, escalatory risks, and humanitarian toll. Terms include regime change advocacy, state of emergency, civilian casualties. Claims mention targeting Iranian leadership and bipartisan concerns about prolonged conflict.\n\n**Discipline 2 (Center):** Talks about pre-emptive strikes against Iran's nuclear/military targets, civilian casualties, failed diplomacy. Terms include pre-emptive attack, Operation Epic Fury, diplomatic de-escalation. Claims note collaboration with the U.S., civilian deaths, Iran's retaliation, and condemnation from global actors.\n\n**Discipline 3 (Center-Right):** Discusses a ceasefire with Hamas, Palestinian returns to Gaza, territorial concessions. Terms like ceasefire agreement, buffer zones, Hamas gains. Claims focus on concessions under pressure, fragile ceasefire, and rejection of U.S. proposals.\n\n**Discipline 4 (Right):** Portrays Israel's actions as preemptive and existential necessity against Iran's nuclear threat. Terms include existential threat, US-Israel coordination, sovereignty defense. Claims highlight Netanyahu framing strikes as preventing nuclear holocaust and joint air defense systems.\n\nNow, looking for **convergent** concepts. \n\n- **Military Collaboration with US:** Disciplines 0,1,2,4 all mention Israel working with the U.S. in military operations. Even though 3 is about Hamas, the others (0,1,2,4) discuss joint strikes. But the user grouped 0,1,3 in the example. Wait, perhaps I need to find concepts that appear in two or more. For example, \"Regime change\" is in 1 and 0? Wait, Discipline 0's summary mentions enabling structures through support, but regime change is explicitly in 1's summary. Maybe looking for overlapping terms like \"civilian casualties\" appears in 1, 2, and 3? Let me check:\n\nLooking at the summaries:\n\n- Discipline 0: Mentions suppression of Palestinian self-determination, no direct mention of civilian casualties.\n- Discipline 1: \"humanitarian toll\", \"civilian casualties\".\n- Discipline 2: \"Civilian Casualties\".\n- Discipline 3: Not directly; it's about ceasefire and territorial issues.\n- Discipline 4: No mention of civilian harm.\n\nSo \"civilian casualties\" appears in 1 and 2, maybe 3? Not sure. Another angle: The concept of U.S.-Israel collaboration is in 0,1,2,4. But the user wants at least two disciplines. Maybe Regime change is in 1 and another discipline? Let's check:\n\nDiscipline 1: \"explicitly seeking regime change\".\nDiscipline 4 perhaps? 4 mentions targeting leadership, which could tie into regime change, but the Right's focus is more on defense. So regime change might be unique to 1 and 0. Wait, Discipline 0's Left critique might not mention regime change but the Israeli actions as part of destabilization. Maybe \"military collaboration\" is a convergent concept across multiple disciplines. For example:\n\nDiscipline 0: \"key military ally of the U.S.\".\nDiscipline 1: \"joint military operations\".\nDiscipline 2: \"collaboration with US\".\nDiscipline 4: \"US-Israel coordination\".\n\nThat's 0,1,2,4. So that's a convergent concept. But the user example only lists 0,1,3. Maybe another convergent point is civilian impact. Let me check. \n\nAnother convergent concept could be **civilian casualties/humanitarian impact** across disciplines 1,2, maybe 3. 3 focuses on ceasefire fragility but not directly on casualties. So 1 and 2. Also, Discipline 0's Nakba analysis relates to systemic displacement, which is a form of humanitarian impact but not direct casualties. So maybe that's a different point.\n\nAnother possible convergent concept is **regional destabilization**. Discipline 0 mentions regional destabilization, Discipline 1 talks about escalatory risks, Discipline 2 mentions regional stability as a term, and Discipline 4 discusses sovereign defense leading to regional tensions. So that could be across 0,1,2,4.\n\nBut the user might want more precise groupings. Let me check the terms and claims again.\n\nLooking at the terms:\n\nDiscipline 0 terms: Apartheid, Self-determination denial.\nDiscipline 1 terms: Regime Change Advocacy, Humanitarian Toll.\nDiscipline 2: Civilian Casualties, Humanitarian Law Violations.\nDiscipline 3: Ceasefire, Territorial Concessions.\nDiscipline 4: Existential threat, Preemptive strike.\n\nFrom the claims, perhaps \"civilian casualties\" in 1 & 2. So that's a convergent. \n\nAnother convergent could be focus on **Iranian leadership targeting** in 1 and 2. Both mention targeting Supreme Leader and other leaders.\n\nLooking at Discipline 1's claims: \"targeting Iran's leadership and infrastructure\". Discipline 2's claims: \"targeting Iranian leadership and nuclear facilities\". So that's a convergent between 1 and 2.\n\nAlso, **diplomatic failures** are noted in Discipline 1 and 2. Discipline 1: \"diplomatic solution to nuclear dispute dimmed\", Discipline 2: \"strikes occurred amidst failed nuclear negotiations\".\n\nAnother possible convergent is **US backing/legitimization** of Israel's actions. Discipline 0 says Australia (as a US ally?) legitimizes Israel's actions. Discipline 1 says US-Israel joint operations. Discipline 2 mentions US collaboration. Discipline 4 emphasizes coordination. So that's a cross-cutting convergent among 0,1,2,4.\n\nBut the user's example uses three disciplines. Let me see:\n\nConvergent example from the user had disciplines 0,1,3. Maybe another concept like \"regional instability\" across disciplines. But let's proceed.\n\n**Contradictory elements:** For example, Left (0) critiques Israeli actions as enabling apartheid and suppression, whereas Center (2) focuses on preemptive strikes as legitimate defense. So there's a tension between viewing the actions as oppressive versus necessary for security.\n\nAnother contradiction could be between Center-Right (3) discussing ceasefire with Hamas as concessions, whereas Right (4) emphasizes military action against Iran as defense without mentioning concessions. So different approaches to conflict (negotiation vs military action).\n\n**Emergent insights:** Combining disciplines might show that Israel's strategy involves simultaneous military engagement with Iran and negotiated ceasefires with Hamas, which could be a dual approach. Alternatively, the focus on both Iranian nuclear threats and Palestinian issues might be part of a broader regional security strategy that's complex and multi-front.\n\nWait, but the user's provided sources include the ABC News article about US-Israel strikes on Iran and Reuters on the same, BBC on Israel eyeing regime change, UN document on Iran's complaint about US-Israel aggression, and a Washington Institute PDF on Palestinian autonomy. So the actual sources are a mix of Iran-Israel conflict and Palestinian issues.\n\nIn the disciplines, Discipline 3 (Center-Right) is discussing Palestinian ceasefire and Gaza, whereas others focus on Iran. So perhaps the emergent insight is that Israel is managing two fronts: Iran and Palestinian issues, which could be interdependent in their strategy.\n\nPutting this all together:\n\nConvergent concepts:\n\n1. **US-Israel Military Collaboration**: Disciplines 0,1,2,4 all mention joint military operations with the US against Iran.\n2. **Civilian Casualties/Humanitarian Impact**: Disciplines 1 and 2 both highlight civilian deaths and humanitarian consequences.\n3. **Leadership Targeting**: Disciplines 1 and 2 mention strikes aimed at Iranian leadership (Supreme Leader, President).\n4. **Diplomatic Failures**: Disciplines 1 and 2 note the breakdown in diplomatic efforts regarding Iran's nuclear program.\n\nContradictory elements:\n\n1. **Perception of Military Actions**: Left (0) views actions as enabling apartheid and oppression, while Center (2) and Right (4) frame them as necessary for security/existential defense.\n2. **Approach to Hamas vs Iran**: Center-Right (3) focuses on ceasefire and concessions to Hamas, whereas others (Right, Center, Center-Left) focus on military action against Iran without linking to Palestinian issues.\n\nEmergent insights:\n\n1. **Dual-Front Strategy**: Israel's engagement in simultaneous military operations against Iran and ceasefire negotiations with Hamas suggests a complex, multi-front approach to regional security.\n2. **Legitimacy vs. Security**: The interplay between international legitimacy (critiques of civilian harm, apartheid) and national security narratives (existential threats, preemptive strikes) reveals a tension in justifying military actions.\n3. **Regime Change and Ceasefire Linkage**: While not explicitly stated, the pursuit of regime change in Iran (Disciplines 1,0) alongside territorial concessions to Hamas (Discipline 3) may indicate a broader strategy to reshape regional power dynamics in Israel's favor.\n\nThis should cover the required elements. Now, translating this into the JSON structure as instructed.\n",

Explosions also rang out in nearby oil-producing [Gulf Arab countries], which said they had intercepted missiles from Iran after Tehran warned it would strike the region if it was attacked.\nSign up [here.] \nThe first wave of strikes in what the Pentagon named &quot;OPERATION EPIC FURY&quot; mainly targeted Iranian officials, a source familiar with the matter said.\nAn Israeli official said Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Masoud Pezeshkian were both targeted but the result of the strikes was not clear. A source with knowledge of the matter had earlier told Reuters that Khamenei was not in Tehran and had been transferred to a secure location.\nAn Iranian source close to the establishment said several senior commanders in Iran&#x27;s Revolutionary Guards and political officials had been killed. Forty people were killed in an Israeli airstrike on a school, state media said. Reuters could not independently confirm the reports.\n## HOPES DIM FOR DIPLOMATIC SOLUTION TO NUCLEAR DISPUTE\nThe renewed confrontation between Iran and its long-time foes dimmed hopes of a diplomatic solution to Tehran&#x27;s nuclear dispute with the West. The latest indirect talks between the U.S. and Iran this week failed to produce a breakthrough.\nIran&#x27;s Revolutionary Guards said all [U.S. bases] and interests in the region were within Iran&#x27;s reach and that the retaliation would continue until &quot;the enemy is decisively defeated&quot;.\nIran&#x27;s foreign minister told counterparts from Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain and Iraq that Tehran would use all its defensive and military capabilities to defend itself.\nLoud booms sounded in the United Arab Emirates capital Abu Dhabi, an oil producer and U.S. ally. Fighter jets flew around the Yas Island area of Abu Dhabi on Saturday afternoon and blasts were heard in the country&#x27;s business capital Dubai.\nBahrain said the service center of the U.S. Fifth Fleet had been subjected to a missile attack. Video footage from witnesses in Bahrain showed a thick grey plume of smoke rising from near the small island state&#x27;s coastline as sirens wailed.\nFellow Gulf Arab state Qatar said it had downed all missiles targeting the country and that it had a right to respond. Sirens were later heard in its capital Doha.\nExplosions were heard near Iran&#x27;s Kharg Island. Iran exports 90 percent of its crude oil via Kharg, for shipping through the narrow Strait of Hormuz.\n[Global airlines] cancelled flights across the Middle East and the attacks raised the prospect of oil prices rising.\n&quot;If we don’t see signs of de-escalation over the weekend, risk premiums could still drive Brent (crude) up by $10–$20/bbl (a barrel) on Monday,&quot; said Jorge Leon, head of geopolitical analysis at Rystad Energy.\n## TRUMP CITES 1979 HOSTAGE CRISIS\nItem 1 of 11 Smoke rises in the sky after blasts were heard in Manama, Bahrain, February 28, 2026.

REUTERS/Stringer [Purchase Licensing Rights, opens new tab] \nIn a video message published on social media, [Trump] cited Washington&#x27;s decades-old dispute with Iran, including the seizure of the 1979 U.S. embassy in Tehran, when students held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days, as well as a range of other attacks the U.S. has blamed on Iran since the 1979 Islamic revolution brought the clerics to power.\nHe urged Iranians to stay sheltered because &quot;bombs will be dropping everywhere&quot;. But he also added: &quot;When we are finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take. This will be probably your only chance for generations.”\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the joint U.S.-Israeli attack &quot;will create the conditions for the brave Iranian people to take their destiny into their own hands&quot; and &quot; remove the yoke of tyranny&quot;. Defence Minister Israel Katz called it a pre-emptive strike to remove threats to Israel.\nThe scope of the U.S. air and sea operations was not immediately clear. The campaign is expected to last for multiple days, a U.S. official said.\nIn Tehran, witnesses said people were rushing to banks to withdraw cash. Long queues formed at gas stations across cities. Many also worried about a potential internet blackout that would cut off communication with their families abroad.\n“We are being killed by the regime and by Israel. We are the victims of this regime’s hostile policies,” said Maryam, 54, a [housewife in Tehran], as she headed to northern Iran with her family.\nIsrael&#x27;s military did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the strike at a primary school for girls southern Iran, where Iranian state media reported 40 deaths.\nIraq&#x27;s Iran-aligned armed group Kataib Hezbollah said it would soon attack U.S. bases in the region.\n## US MILITARY BUILDUP\n[Trump] had built up a vast U.S. military presence in the region to try to force Tehran to make concessions in the nuclear talks. He said the &quot;massive&quot; operation was intended to ensure Tehran does not obtain a nuclear weapon.\nThe U.S. and Iran renewed negotiations in February on the nuclear dispute. Iran, which denies seeking atomic bombs, said it was prepared to discuss curbs on its nuclear programme in exchange for lifting [sanctions] but ruled out linking the issue to missiles.\nIran&#x27;s ballistic missile programme has been a significant sticking point, with Trump saying Tehran was developing long-range missiles that threaten the U.S.\n&quot;Our objective is to defend the American people by eliminating imminent threats from the Iranian regime,&quot; Trump said.\nThe attacks follows a 12-day air war last June between Israel and Iran and repeated U.S.-Israeli warnings that they would strike again if Iran pressed ahead with its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.\nAn Israeli defence official said the operation had been planned for months in coordination with Washington, and that the launch date was decided weeks ago.\nThe Israeli military announced the [closure of schools] and workplaces, with exceptions for essential sectors, and a ban on public airspace. Israel closed its airspace to civilian flights.\nReporting by Reuters bureaux; Writing by Michael Georgy; Editing by Barbara Lewis, Sam Holmes and Timothy Heritage\nOur Standards: [The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles., opens new tab] \nShare\n*\nX\n*\nFacebook\n*\nLinkedin\n*\nEmail\n*\nLink\n[Purchase Licensing Rights] \n[\n] \n[Alexander Cornwell] \nThomson Reuters\nAlexander has over a decade of international reporting experience.

His government has remained equally silent.\n&quot;It shows you the importance Netanyahu puts on this moment,&quot; said Danny Citrinowicz, who served for 25 years in Israel&#x27;s Defence Intelligence, and is now senior Iran researcher at Israel&#x27;s Institute for National Security Studies.\n&quot;For Netanyahu, being in this position where the US has so many forces in the Gulf, being so close to Trump attacking Iran, this is - for him - a golden moment in time that he cannot forgo.&quot;\nAsaf Cohen, a former deputy director of Israel&#x27;s signals intelligence unit, says there&#x27;s strategy in Israel&#x27;s silence too.\n&quot;The [Israeli] leadership believes we should allow the Americans to lead the way this time, because they are stronger, have more capabilities, and have much more legitimacy in the world.&quot;\nBenjamin Netanyahu has long seen Iran as the key threat facing Israel, and the biggest source of instability in the Middle East. His public silence does not signal a lack of private discussion with his key US ally.\nThis week, Israel&#x27;s military intelligence chief, Shlomi Binder, met US intelligence agencies in Washington. According to Israeli media, the discussion focused on possible targets in Iran.\n![]![Getty Images A smiling Netanyahu, who has grey hair and wears a suit, at a lectern in during a press conference at Mar-a-Lago in December with Trump, who has blonde combed over hair and also wears a suit] Getty Images\nNetanyahu reportedly asked Trump to hold back in his response to Iran earlier this month\nCitrinowicz believes Netanyahu is privately pushing the US towards maximalist strikes aimed at regime change in Iran, and that when Netanyahu reportedly urged Trump to hold back earlier this month, he says, it was because he viewed the planned US attack as &quot;too small&quot;.\nNetanyahu has previously urged Iranians to &quot;stand up&quot; to their regime, in an interview with Fox News last year.\nUS president Donald Trump is currently considering a range of actions against Iran – they are reported to include both limited symbolic strikes and full-blown regime change. In public, he has alternated military threats with the offer of fresh negotiations.\nWhile many US allies are warning that trying to unseat Iran&#x27;s leadership carries huge risks for the region, many in Israel see potential benefits for their security.\nBy changing the regime in Tehran, Israel would hope to end the threat from Iran&#x27;s ballistic missiles, and the possibility that it would one day acquire nuclear weapons too.\nIt would also further weaken Iran&#x27;s proxy militia around the region, including [Hezbollah], which still has up to 25,000 missiles and rockets across the border in Lebanon according to Israel&#x27;s Alma research institute.\nIn contrast, some Israeli lawmakers believe a limited strike, or even a new deal with Iran, could carry bigger risks for Israel&#x27;s security by leaving the regime in place.\n&quot;When you deal with total evil, you don&#x27;t act limited,&quot; said Moshe Tur-Paz, a member of the Yesh Atid opposition party who sits on the Defence Committee of Israel&#x27;s parliament.\n&quot;There&#x27;s a consensus that Israel should act much stronger and so should the Western world. When it comes to our worst enemies like Iran, there are no big differences. We all understand the threat.&quot;\nAnother round of conflict that left the regime intact would not be worth the price paid in Iran&#x27;s retaliation, many say.\nDuring the [12-day war last year], when Israel and the US attacked Iran&#x27;s nuclear and ballistic missile sites, Iran fired back hundreds of ballistic missiles at Israeli towns and cities. Some evaded Israel&#x27;s vaunted air-defences, [slamming into apartment blocks in Tel Aviv] and killing at least 28 people.\n[\n## Why Iran&#x27;s response to a US attack could be different this time\n] \n[\n## What could happen if the US strikes Iran? Here are seven scenarios\n] \n![]![Reuters Israeli police in front of a destroyed block] Reuters\nSome Iranian missiles got through Israeli air defences during the 12-day war\nThe Israeli military had prepared for many more casualties, but Tehran&#x27;s heightened sense of vulnerability now could mean a more intense response.\nAnd analysts have suggested that Iran learned from that conflict, adapting its tactics as the war progressed. Half a year on, Iran is rebuilding its missile stocks.\nThis week, a senior adviser to Iran&#x27;s Supreme Leader warned on social media that Tel Aviv would be hit with an &quot;immediate and unprecedented&quot; response in the event of any US attack.\n&quot;Netanyahu is afraid Israel will [again] go through the pain of an attack without a change of regime,&quot; said Citrinowicz. &quot;He came to the conclusion that to stop the missiles being built, you have to have regime change, but regime change can happen only with the US.&quot;\nAnd this moment of intense vulnerablity for the Iranian regime – its military defences diminished after the 12-day war, its regional proxy forces weakened, and after widespread protests against its rule at home – also represents an opportunity, says Cohen.\n&quot;Iran is at its weakest now - this is an opportunity that may not come again,&quot; said Cohen. &quot;There are a lot of people who believe this is the time - it&#x27;s now or never.&quot;\nIn Tel Aviv, residents still living with the wreckage from Iranian missile strikes last June are speculating about another conflict.\n&quot;I hope [our leaders] don&#x27;t miss this opportunity,&quot; said Neria, a young man in his early 20s.\n&quot;If it&#x27;s through attack or through other means, I don&#x27;t know, but certainly we should leverage the situation to switch regimes. It won&#x27;t be the first time we&#x27;ll deal with the bombs - it&#x27;s not nice, but if it&#x27;s going to help us in the longer term to feel safer here then we will have to go through it&quot;.\n![]![Dave Bull/BBC Tel Aviv beach] Dave Bull/BBC\nPoll suggest Israelis support military action against Iran\nShani, a young woman nearby, said she had mixed feelings.\n&quot;I know the Iranian people - many of them - want the US to help. I just hope that everyone will stay safe,&quot; she said. &quot;Politicians need to think about the people. Actions have consequences.&quot;\nIsraeli polls repeatedly show a strong majority of Jewish residents support military action against Iran - including after the 12-day war last year.\nBut the risks of regime change remain. With no obvious cracks in the military and clerical alliance around Iran&#x27;s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and a splintered opposition movement in the country, it&#x27;s not clear who would take over control of Iran if the government fell.\nA younger successor from the same ruling elite would not necessarily be more flexible in their response to Israel, and the chaos of a civil war would not only be deeply destabilising for Iranians, but for the region as a whole.\nAnd several defence insiders have pointed out that regimes are not usually toppled by air-strikes alone.\nIsrael&#x27;s prime minister, facing elections this year, has worked hard since the Hamas attacks to try and restore his broken image as Israel&#x27;s &quot;Mr Security&quot;. Regime change in Iran – or Khamanei&#x27;s assassination - would be a political prize, but also a risk.\n&quot;It is a gamble, but it&#x27;s a calculated one,&quot; says Citrinowicz.\n&quot;Netanyahu couldn&#x27;t care less what happens the day after Khamenei. He wants to show, together with Trump, that he destroyed the Iranian regime. It&#x27;s a risk he&#x27;s willing to take if he knows the Americans will go all the way. The problem is Trump.&quot;\n![]![Getty Images Iran&#x27;s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, who has glasses and a grey beard and is wearing long dark robes, waves at a crowd in Tehran] Getty Images\nProtests in Iran have so far failed to overthrow Ayatollah Khamenei&#x27;s regime\nBoth the US and Iran have said they are open to negotiations, but Trump has conditioned talks on ending Iran&#x27;s uranium enrichment along with its support for proxies in the region, and limits on its ballistic missiles – all seen as red lines for the regime.\nIsrael&#x27;s leadership is firmly against a deal, and Israeli analysts are divided over whether one is even achievable.\nCohen said he thought both Washington and Tehran wanted an agreement, but that if one wasn&#x27;t reached soon the US would strike.\n&quot;Iran&#x27;s Supreme Leader and Trump have something in common.

In a\npress release dated 25 November 2025, the United States Air Force publicly\nacknowledged – for the first time – its direct involvement in the strikes against Iran’s\nsafeguarded and entirely peaceful nuclear facilities at Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan.\nThe statement said: “In June, the 34th was called upon to escort a strike package,\nincluding B-2 Spirit bombers, … to strike underground nuclear sites at Fordow,\nNatanz, and Isfahan during Operation Midnight Hammer.” It further reveals that: “On\nJune 22 a formation of F-35s flown by 388th Fighter Wing pilots were the first aircraft\nto penetrate Iranian airspace, … escorting the B-2s to the target areas.”\n1\nThese disclosures are further corroborated by the recent statement by the United\nStates President, Donald Trump, on 6 November 2025, who openly affirmed\nresponsibility and the leading role of the United States in the acts of aggression by\nthe Israeli regime against the Islamic Republic of Iran.\nThe act of aggression perpetrated by the Israeli regime, in coordination with the\nUnited States, was directed against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the\nIslamic Republic of Iran, in blatant violation of Article 2 (4) of the Charter of the\nUnited Nations. This aggression included deliberate attacks against civilians and\ncivilian objects, in flagrant disregard of the fundamental principles of international\nlaw and international humanitarian law.\nAs emphasized in the aforementioned letters, the United States is under an\nobligation to make full reparation for the injuries caused by said violations against\nIran and its citizens, including any material and moral damage. This includes an\nobligation to make restitution and compensate for the damage caused thereby, under\nestablished international law. In the meantime, the confession also entails individual\ncriminal responsibility by any United States officials and individuals involved in\n__________________\n1 See www.388fw.acc.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/4341059/hill-airmen-carry-out-historic\u0002f-35-deployment-to-centcom/.\nS/2025/773\n2/2 25-19574\ngrave breaches of international humanitarian law, including for the crime of\naggression. Therefore, the Islamic Republic of Iran reserves its full and unequivocal\nright to pursue, through all available legal avenues, the establishment of\naccountability for those responsible and also to secure full reparation for all losses\nand damages incurred as a result of this internationally wrongful act.\nIn light of the United States’ own admissions of its role and responsibility in\ncommitting these internationally wrongful acts, the Security Council and the broader\nUnited Nations system cannot remain silent. The Islamic Republic of Iran once again\nreiterates its call on the Secretary-General and the Security Council to take\nappropriate measures, consistent with their responsibility for the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security, to ensure the accountability of both the United States\nand the Israeli regime for these grave violations and to bring the perpetrators of these\ncrimes to justice.\nI would be grateful if you would have the present letter circulated as a document\nof the Security Council.\n(Signed) Amir Saeid Iravani\nAmbassador\nPermanent Representative"

Having proved its assertiveness and\nstrength, and having led a wide-ranging coalition into battle,\nthe United States has, since the war's end, embarked on an\nenergetic diplomatic effort aimed at settling the long-standing\nconflict between the majority of the Arab states and Israel. The\npeace conference that Secretary of State James A. Baker III has\norganized will grapple with a number of issues. One of the\nmost contentious and significant will be the future of the\nPalestinians of Gaza and the West Bank.\nWe have been down this road before. When Egypt and\nIsrael signed the historic Camp David Accords in 1978, they\npledged to negotiate a workable future for the Palestinians,\nbeginning with an interim period of self-government, or\nautonomy. This First interim goal was never achieved, despite\nyears of diplomatic effort, in large part because the Palestinians\nthemselves chose not to take part in the discussions, a stance\nthat thoughtful Palestinians may now regret. Today, as\nnegotiations between Palestinians and Israelis get under way,\nthe concept of autonomy is sure to be revived, and with it a\nnumber of questions: What exactly is this \"autonomy\" or, as it\nis now called, \"self-government?\" Where does the idea come\nfrom? What kinds of rights and responsibilities might it\nx PALESTINIAN SELF-GOVERNMENT\nencompass? What are the chances of its success? And, finally,\nis it a good idea?\nFortunately, these questions need not be answered in a\nvacuum. The post-Camp David negotiations between Egypt and\nIsrael and the fits and starts of Mideast diplomacy in the 1980s\nleft behind a fascinating, if largely unexamined, record.\nMany of the questions sure to arise during the course of this\nlatest round of peacemaking were discussed during earlier\ndiplomatic rounds, and looking at that record can help us\nunderstand autonomy's meaning, limits, and possibilities.\nThere are few scholars better equipped to examine the\nmeaning of Palestinian autonomy than Dr. Harvey\nSicherman, a seasoned diplomatic historian and veteran of\ngovernment and a long-time associate of The Washington\nInstitute. In anticipation of the Middle East peace conference he\nhas scoured the written record of earlier autonomy\nnegotiations, interviewed many of the participants, and\nexhaustively thought through the meaning of that past\nexperience and the message it bears for today. This\nexceptionally timely, judicious, and gracefully written study\nis a fine example of the special contribution that scholarship\ncan make to current policy debates.\nBarbi Weinberg\nPresident\nThe Washington Institute for Near East Policy\nPREFACE\nOn November 19, 1977, President Anwar Sadat of Egypt\nastounded the world when he visited Jerusalem to pursue peace\ntalks directly with Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin.\nAddressing the Knesset the next day, Sadat insisted that a\nsolution to the Arab-Israeli conflict include a Palestinian \"right\nto statehood.\" Thus challenged, some six weeks later Begin\nunveiled Israel's response: \"self-rule\" or \"autonomy\" for the\nPalestinian Arabs under Israeli military government.\nAfter excruciating negotiations, a version of this idea of\nautonomy became part of the Camp David Accords signed by\nEgypt, Israel, and the United States on September 17, 1978.\nUnlike the Egyptian-Israeli Peace Treaty, however, Camp\nDavid's \"full autonomy\"—a five-year transitional arrangement\nfor a freely elected self-governing authority (sometimes\nreferred to as an administrative council) for the inhabitants of\nthe West Bank and Gaza—never came to fruition. The\nPalestinians (and Jordan) rejected the idea and, despite\nintensive negotiations, Egypt, Israel, and the United States\ncould not agree on all of its terms. Then, after three years of\neffort, Egypt suspended the talks in August of 1982 in response\nto Israel's invasion of Lebanon.\nThis grim record would seem at first of merely academic\ninterest, another dead end in a conflict full of dead ends. But\nthe autonomy concept—that of an interim agreement in the\nWest Bank and Gaza giving more government to Palestinians\nand less control to Israelis—did not perish. The 1980s showed\nthat neither international pressure on behalf of the Palestinian\nLiberation Organization (PLO) nor the intifadah would force\nxii PALESTINIAN SELF-GOVERNMENT\nIsrael to yield Judea, Samaria, and the Gaza District (as it is\nknown in Israel), or the West Bank and Gaza (as it is known to\neveryone else), to an Arab sovereignty in a single step—if ever.\nWhile the Palestinians and their allies have spent their time\nand energies pushing for statehood, the number of Israeli\nsettlers in the territories (excluding Jerusalem) has steadily\nincreased from 10,000 in 1980 to more than 100,000 in 1992.\nMeanwhile, the Palestinian situation has also grown\nmeasurably worse. The hopes raised by the intifadah, by the\nPLO's dialogue with the United States, and then by Saddam\nHussein have all been dashed. Even the demographic situation\nthat for so long argued in favor of the Palestinians has been\naltered by the influx of great numbers of Soviet Jews into Israel.\nClearly an independent Palestinian state seems further than\never from fruition, and a more realistic Palestinian (and Arab)\napproach may be under way. As Secretary of State James A.\nBaker III said after his flurry of trips in the spring of 1991, he\nhad found \"agreement that the negotiations between Israel and\nthe Palestinians would proceed in phases, with talks on\ninterim self-government preceding negotiations over the\npermanent status of the Occupied Territories.\"\nNotably, of course, the current discussions of such an\ninterim agreement do not include the words \"autonomy\" or\n\"Camp David.\" For although the Palestinians and the Arabs\nmay be well on their way toward accepting both the concept\nand the framework, they do not wish to encumber their\njourney with embarrassing historical baggage.\nThe way is marked, nonetheless, with the signposts of\nirony. Although in the dictionary autonomy means \"self\u0002government,\" to the Palestinians the word represents an Israeli\nattempt to limit their sovereignty. The Israelis for their part see\n\"self-government\" as a term fairly bursting with sovereignty,\nand at Camp David they insisted successfully that the Self\u0002Governing Authority, as autonomy was to be known, be\ndescribed parenthetically as an administrative council.\nIt may therefore be both more convenient and still quite\naccurate to describe the matter differently by calling the\nproposed regime \"Palestinian Self-Government (Autonomy).\"\nThis term expresses both the Palestinians' greatest hope for the\nconcept's future and its necessary bloodline to the past—its roots\nin limited powers that respect Israeli aspirations and interests.\nThroughout this book these terms—\"self-government\" and\nPREFACE Xlll\n\"autonomy\"—will be used interchangeably unless otherwise\nnoted.\nMy main purpose, however, is not to preoccupy otherwise\ngainfully unemployed political philologists. Now that self\u0002government (autonomy) is once again of interest, two\nimportant questions must be answered: Will it solve the\nPalestinian problem, or at least put it on the road to solution?\nAnd how could the United States help to bring this about?\nThis book hopes to answer such questions through a review\nof autonomy's past and an exploration of its potential as a form\nof self-government. Revisiting the past will surely not amuse\nthe reader or titillate the diplomats; there is precious little\nentertainment in the record. It does, however, establish these\npoints:\n(1) Interim Agreements Are Not the Last Word: Attempts to\n\"guarantee\" the end game through an interim agreement will\nmake even the interim step impossible. Self-government\n(autonomy) does not assure Palestinian national independence\nnor does it guarantee Israeli sovereignty over the territory.\n(2) The \"Last Word\" Will Still Intrude: Notwithstanding\nautonomy's deliberate ambiguity, long-term consequences\nflow from different negotiating positions, and the fear of those\nconsequences will intrude even as interim steps are discussed.\n(3) Outside Help Will Be Needed: Given the risks to be run by\nboth sides on issues such as security, land, water, settlements,\nand Jerusalem, outside help in reducing these risks and\novercoming the obstacles will be necessary. The United States\nremains best suited to play the role of mediator, but other\ninternational support will also be needed both within the\nregion and outside of it.\n(4) The Deal Must Work on Its Own Terms: Autonomy can\nfacilitate state-to-state peace diplomacy (it did so for Egypt and\nIsrael) but only if those states have decided to seek peace on\nsound bilateral foundations. Conversely, a larger peace process\ninvolving state-to-state negotiations can work to encourage an\nautonomy agreement, but it cannot be a substitute for an Israeli\u0002Palestinian deal that works for both sides.\nI then take these lessons and explore (1) the impact that\nsubsequent peace plans—Reagan (1982), Peres-Hussein (1985),\nShultz (1988), Shamir-Rabin (1989), and Baker (1989-1990)—\nhave had on the autonomy concept, and (2) the probable\nxiv PALESTINIAN SELF-GOVERNMENT\ndevelopment of Palestinian self-government, should it occur,\nwith special emphasis on the role of the United States.\nMy general conclusion is this: If ever there were a time for\nPalestinian self-government (autonomy), that time is now, and\nthe parties to the dispute would seem to agree. Encouraged by\nthe United States, several rounds of negotiations on this issue\nhave already occurred, following the successful convening of\nthe Madrid Peace Conference on October 30, 1991. Moreover,\nthe victor in the June 1992 Israeli election, Yitzhak Rabin, has\nmade plain his intention to reach agreement soon. Finally, the\nPalestinians, through their own plan submitted to the Israelis,\nhave begun to grapple at last with the concept.\nThe reasons for this renewed interest are clear. Only on the\nmuch-disputed ground between Israelis and Palestinian Arabs\nin the territories can there be found the strongest common\ninterest in changing the status quo. Only through the\ntransitional device of Palestinian self-government (autonomy)\ncan that change be most safely made to each party's advantage,\nwithout forcing them to yield what they will not yet yield:\nnamely, their conflicting claims of sovereignty. And,\nultimately, only through lasting improvement in Israeli\u0002Palestinian relations can the decades-long strife in the Holy\nLand draw to a close.\nUnited States policy, then, should focus on facilitating an\nagreement on self-government (autonomy) by (1) using its\ngood offices to recruit broader Arab and international support,\n(2) isolating those who would obstruct it, (3) helping the parties,\nwhich must include both recognized Palestinian\nrepresentatives and, at some point, Jordan, to overcome the\nobstacles, (4) concentrating in particular on the land, water,\nand security issues, the essence of any agreement on self\u0002government, and (5) offering some guarantee of support for the\nresult, whether political, economic, or military, as was done in\nevery successful Arab-Israeli agreement thus far. The history\nof the Arab-Israeli conflict is a chronicle of missed\nopportunities. This latest chance to improve relations between\nthose fated to live together is an opportunity that the parties—\nand the United States—should not miss again.\nHarvey Sicherman\nWashington, D.

S.\nxv\n\nAN INTRODUCTION TO THE\nARAB-ISRAELI CONFLICT\nAmong the conflicts that dominate the history of the\ntwentieth century, that between the Arabs and the Israelis\noccupies a special place. Other struggles have been equally\nviolent, but few have been punctuated as frequently by large\nscale war and enduring hatreds. To understand it, therefore,\none must answer the question not only of why the conflict, but\nwhy it has been so intractable.\nThe best, though not the simplest, answer may be this: two\npeoples want the same land, each conceives of it to be a life or\ndeath struggle, and their fight also intersects with both\nregional and great power rivalries. The student of the Arab\u0002Israeli conflict must master several situations at once: the rights\nand wrongs of historic claims; a complex and dizzying round\nof regional rivalries, sometimes near the scene of conflict,\nsometimes affecting it from afar; and finally, the continuous\ncompetition among powers foreign to the Middle East but\ndetermined to protect their vital interests in a vital area.\nAdded to this tangle is the impact of personality on history.\nThe tale is teeming with colorful leaders, villains, gamblers\nand the occasional statesman all bidding for the brass ring of\nfame. Many a diplomat's reputation has found its burial place\nin the Arab-Israeli conflict, but there is also a goodly share of\nsurprises, including those most unlikely peacemakers, Anwar\nSadat and Menachem Begin.\nIt has also proven uncommonly difficult for observers to\nremain detached from the emotions that pervade the Arab\u0002Israeli conflict. Few who study the situation can escape the\n2 PALESTINIAN SELF-GOVERNMENT\nirony that Arabs and Israelis fight over land sacred to three\ngreat religions which preach the virtues of peace. And fewer\nstill, especially Americans, who put little stock in history, can\nremain unfazed as the protagonists argue over the events of\nlong ago, the better to wound each other.\nThree distinct stages of the Arab-Israeli struggle may be\ndiscerned before the great breakthrough at Camp David in\n1978. The first stage predates the state of Israel: it sets the Jews\nand Arabs of British-ruled Palestine on a collision course. The\nsecond stage brings the full play of Arab national rivalries and\nGreat Power competition to the boil in the wars of 1956 and\n1967. Finally, the third stage, while full of the same elements,\nprepares the way for the peacemaking of 1978 and with it, the\nsubject of this book—autonomy or self-rule for the Palestinian\nArabs.\nThe patterns traced here offer clear guidelines for the\nfuture. Peacemaking between Arab and Israeli, and especially\nbetween the Palestinian Arab and the Israeli Jew, needs\nAmerican mediation to succeed. But American mediation\nalone does not guarantee success unless the parties want it. The\ngreatest risk and burdens to achieve peace and then to sustain it\nfall finally upon them.\nSTAGE ONE: TWO PEOPLES,\nONE LAND, MANY INTERESTS\nThe ethnic and religious antagonisms that disfigure the\nMiddle East often find their roots in distant history. But for all\nintents and purposes, the Arab-Israeli conflict as we know it is\nbut a hundred years old. Political Zionism was founded\nsuddenly in 1897 by Theodor Herzl, a Viennese journalist,\nwho saw a Jewish state as the only alternative for Jewish\nsurvival in a world destined to be shaken by national\nantagonisms.\nZionism, defined as Jewish attachment to the Biblical land\nof Israel, was not new. Ever since the Romans destroyed the\nancient Jewish state, there had been an ebb and flow of Jews to\nthe country, stimulated by religious zeal or messianic\nexpectation. Aided by philanthropists such as the Rothschilds,\nimmigration had expanded in the latter part of the nineteenth\ncentury. Then, after the assassination of Russia's Tsar\nAlexander II in 1881 dashed expectations of reform in that\nINTRODUCTION TO THE ARAB-ISRAELI CONFLICT 3\ndespotic empire, Zionism took on a secular tinge. Small groups\nof Jewish socialists and Marxists left Russia to establish model\ncommunes in their own sort of Holy Land. The going proved\ndifficult, however, for both the traditional and newer Jewish\nsettlement schemes. Palestine was then part of one of the more\nimpoverished provinces ruled by the so-called \"Sick Man of\nEurope\"—the Ottoman Empire.\nHerzl's \"political Zionism\" was something much more\ndramatic and far less patient than either the religious or\nrevolutionary Jews could conceive. It was intended to be a\nsudden secular redemption that raised the Jew to equality,\nrespect and security among nations. What Herzl sought was\nnothing less than the sanction of all the Great Powers to\nestablish a new Jewish state, thereby solving at a stroke what\nhe called the \"Jewish problem\": a people who would neither be\naccepted as part of other nations nor disappear on its own.\nTo nearly everyone's surprise but his own (he confided to\nhis diary at the opening of the first Zionist Congress that a state\nwould be a reality in fifty years), Herzl's political Zionism\nstruck a deep chord among the Jews.1 It tapped the historic\nyearnings for Zion kept alive by Judaism and the nationalist\npolitical ferment disturbing the decaying Hapsburg and\nRomanov empires, where the Jews had much to fear. And\nalthough Herzl did not achieve his diplomatic purposes by the\ntime of his premature death in 1904, his Zionism won\nsurprisingly wide support among statesmen and leaders\nknown more for their skill at the balance of power than their\nfondness for ideals—or for the Jews.\nOne such man was the British nobleman, Prime Minister\nand Foreign Secretary, Arthur James Balfour, famous in his\ntime for an acidulous wit, feline political skill and keen\nunderstanding of that least romantic of enterprises, the British\nempire. Balfour's conversion to Zionism and his personal\nrelationship with the Zionist leader Chaim Weizmann—a\nRussian-Jewish immigrant to Britain, trained as a chemist—is\nan improbable story with an even less probable result: the\ncommitment of the British government on November 2, 1917,\nto the establishment of a \"Homeland\" for the Jewish people in\nDiary, September 1897. Quoted in Amos Elon, Herzl, (New York: Holt,\nRinehart & Winston, 1975), p. 247.\n4 PALESTINIAN SF.LF-GOVERNMENT\nwhat the British called Palestine. (\"Palestine\" derived from the\nRoman name for the land of the Philistines, a strip along the\nMediterranean coast. The interior was known to Rome as\nJudea until after the suppression of the Bar Kochba revolt in 135\nA.D.)\nThe Balfour Declaration itself was of course not an entirely\naltruistic document.2 It gave Great Britain another reason to\ninterest itself in the disposition of that part of the Ottoman\nEmpire, a part not far from the strategic Suez Canal. It was also\nintended, among other things, to sway American Jewish\nopinion in favor of U.S. entry into the war on Britain's side.\nNevertheless, Balfour and other British Zionists truly expected\nthat the Homeland would develop eventually into a Jewish\nstate. This depended on two factors: British power and Zionist\nsettlement. But when, as a consequence of World War I, the\nBritish captured Palestine from the Ottoman Empire, they\ndiscovered what many early Zionists had already learned.\nThe existing Arab population in the country had their own\npolitical ambitions, and to be the Land of the Jews was not one\nof them.\nThe British also faced other, regional complications. They\nhad promises to keep to the Arabs. The Sharif Hussein of\nMecca, a Muslim functionary charged with care of Islam's\nholiest city, had cast his fate with the British against the\nOttoman Turks early in World War I. His cause was to free the\nArabs of Turkish domination and to create (or recreate) a new\nArab empire. His actions drew on British support for Arab\nindependence through a broad area, including the Sharif s\nown territory and vaguely defined other provinces, some of\nwhich, such as Syria, were known to be coveted by the French.\nHussein's alliance with the Christian British who already\ncontrolled Egypt, the strategic Red Sea port of Aden and the\nTrucial States along the Persian Gulf, had been controversial\namong the Arab nationalists from the start. Unhappily for the\nArab cause, the Arab Revolt (aided by the romantic Orientalist\nT.E. Lawrence) did not possess either the military power or\npolitical cohesion to create a vast new Arab state based on\nDamascus—the Sharif s dream. Instead, the Arabs fell afoul of\n2The classic study of the Declaration is Leonard Stein's The Balfour\nDeclaration, (New York: Simon & Schuster, 1961).\nINTRODUCTION TO THE ARAB-ISRAELI CONFLICT 5\ntheir own bickering, the reassertion of French imperialism\nand Britain's reluctance to cross the French—their vital ally in\nEurope. Hussein's son, and the most accomplished of the\nfamily's diplomats, Emir Faisal, who had occupied Damascus\nwith British permission at the war's end, was forcibly ejected\nfrom Damascus by a French force in 1920.\nAs the 1920s began, the British found themselves bearing\nresponsibility for large conquered populations in Palestine,\nparts of Arabia and Mesopotamia (the Ottoman provinces in\nwhat is now Iraq) who wanted neither London's rule nor, for\nthat matter, the family of the Sharif. Under the leadership of\nWinston Churchill, then head of the Colonial Office, a new\nMiddle Eastern order was created by the Cairo Conference of\nMarch 1921.3 Faisal became ruler of an entirely new state in\nMesopotamia, called Iraq; his younger brother Abdullah was\ngiven part of the Palestinian territory on the eastern side of the\nJordan; and Britain assumed the \"mandate\"4 for a smaller\nPalestine under agreement with the League of Nations, which\napproved the Balfour Declaration as the guiding principle.\nHerzl's political Zionism had triumphed.\nA brief effort (supported by Balfour) was made to interest\nthe U.S. in this Mandate, but President Wilson had bigger\ndifficulties. America's contribution instead became a\ncommission chaired by two Americans from his entourage\n(the King-Crane Commission). They established that the local\npopulation was opposed—violently opposed—to Zionism.\nLawrence, who had been instrumental in devising the\nCairo Conference arrangements, claimed that Britain had\nfinally discharged its obligation to the Arabs, by which he\nmeant Britain's obligation to the Sharif and his family.5 In fact,\nthe settlement of 1921 contained the seeds of its own disorder.\nOn this period, see David Fromkin, A Peace to End All Peace: Creating the\nModern Middle East, 1914-1922, (New York: Avon, 1989).\nMandate system was the formula employed to reconcile European\ncolonial claims with Wilson's self-determination. Each Mandatory\nPower was charged with preparing the people under its control for\nindependence to be achieved in stages.\n5A good account of the Mandate can be found in Christopher Sykes,\nCrossroads to Israel, (Cleveland: World Publishing Co., 1965).\n6 PALESTINIAN SELF-GOVERNMENT\nThe native rulers in Egypt, Iraq and Transjordan were\ncompromised as British dependents, yet anxious to prove their\nindependence from British rule. Many of the states created\nwere either unknown to history (e.g., Iraq), burning with\ngrievances at their reduced state (e.g., Syria), or in the hands of\nrulers ambitious beyond their power (e.g., Abdullah of\nTransjordan). To this cauldron was added the French\noverlordship of Syria and its special position as supporter of a\nseparate, Christian Arab province in Lebanon.\nFinally, the British had taken upon themselves to\nadminister a Palestine Mandate charged with facilitating\nZionist aims while somehow respecting, as the Balfour\nDeclaration put it, \"the civil and religious rights of the non\u0002Jewish inhabitants.\"6\n The Arabs of Palestine saw themselves as\nboth part of a larger Arab resistance to the post-war\narrangements and as special victims because in Palestine\nalone the population balance was being changed against them.\nTheir leadership in this struggle came to be lodged in the\nhands of the Mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin al-Husseini.\nThe Mufti, scion of a prominent, land-owning family, had\nbeen appointed to his religious post (which included\nadministration of the Muslim Charitable Funds in Jerusalem)\nby the British themselves. By all accounts a charming fellow,\nhe pursued a violent course, his aim being to expel the British,\nthen expel or massacre the Jews. (In 1929 and in 1936 he\nachieved notable massacres even with the British present.)\nWhen economic disaster struck in the 1930s, the Mufti rallied\nan increasingly impoverished peasantry into full scale revolt.\nThese years, 1936-1939, ended in an Arab civil war between\nthe Mufti and his opponents, while forcing the often factious\nZionists to create self-defense forces—the Hagana, forerunner\nof today's Israel Defense Forces.\nIncreasingly beset, the British Government convened the\nPeel Commission in 1937 and then, when the Arabs objected,\nignored its recommendation that Palestine be partitioned into\nArab and Jewish states. The Chamberlain government saw the\napproaching struggle with Germany as its priority and a solid\n\"Lawrence's classic account is Seven Pillars of Wisdom, (London: Jonathan\nCape, 1973). See also Jeremy Wilson, Lawrence of Arabia, (New York:\nAtheneum, 1990), the authorized biography.\nINTRODUCTION TO THE ARAB-ISRAELI CONFLICT 7\nposition with the Arabs as essential. The result was the White\nPaper of 1939, which effectively closed off mass Jewish\nemigration to Palestine even as the Nazi horror descended on\nEurope.\nThus, the pre-World War II Mandate period set relations\nbetween the Arabs and Jews of Palestine on a collision course.\nDespite several British efforts to give the Arabs more say in the\nMandatory Administration and a de facto veto in the White\nPaper of 1939, the Arabs, led by the Mufti, refused any\nagreement that preserved either a Jewish right of settlement or\nrecognized the Zionists as legitimate. The Zionists, for their\npart, were able to bring in a considerable number of\nimmigrants,7 create a 'Jewish economy,\" and partly through\nthe connivance of the very Arab elite denouncing them, to\nacquire large tracts of land.8 Eventually, British imperial\ninterests, increasingly hard pressed as the 1930s ran up to\nWorld War, dominated the decisions, and those interests were\nreckoned to be with the big (i.e., Arab) battalions—Egypt and\nIraq. This required a British position against partition.\nSTAGE TWO: ISRAEL EMERGES,\nPAN-ARAB NATIONALISM GROWS,\nAND THE SUPERPOWERS DOMINATE\nAt war's end, the Nazis' mass murder of six million Jews\noffered the bloodiest possible confirmation of Herzl's fears. The\ntriumphant powers, especially the United States, saw in\nZionism the only adequate solution for the survivors. But the\nBritish were still the power in charge and partition was held to\nbe against Britain's Middle East interests, now more politically\n7The number of Jews in Palestine grew from 94,752 in 1922, to 602,586 in\n1946. Justin McCarthy, The Population of Palestine, (New York: Columbia\nUniversity Press, 1990).\n8\nSee Kenneth Stein, The Land Question in Palestine, 1919-1939, (Chapel Hill:\nUniversity of North Carolina Press, 1984). Stein concludes that the\nZionists had successfully and legally purchased the core of a \"national\nterritory\" by 1939.\n8 PALESTINIAN SELF-GOVERNMENT\nimperilled than ever.9 Finally, after a three year struggle with\nitself, the U.S. and the local parties, London gave up the\nMandate in 1947, under chaotic conditions, while at the UN,\nthe U.S. and the USSR voted in rare harmony for partition.10\nThe Zionist leader David Ben Gurion had foreseen that the\nnew state would have to fight for its life against more than the\nlocal Arab forces, still headed by the Mufti (who slipped back\ninto Palestine after spending the war as Hitler's guest in\nBerlin). Now the Zionists faced the armies of Egypt, Iraq, Syria\n(granted independence by France in 1944), and Emir\nAbdullah's British-led Jordan Legion. Added to the Arab ranks\nwas the oil-rich Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which had\nemerged in 1926 when its founder, Ibn Saud, forcibly annexed\nSharif Hussein's kingdom to his own desert domain. But\nagainst all the odds, and aided by Czech arms (approved by\nMoscow in the hopes of gaining a Middle East foothold at\nWestern expense), the fledgling state of Israel managed to\ndefeat its badly coordinated enemies.\nThere then followed a melancholy deadlock. The\nPalestinian Arabs, 600,000 of whom had fled or been\nencouraged to leave their homes (sometimes by Israeli actions,\nsometimes by their leaders' advice or example), refused to\nreconcile themselves to the Jewish state's survival. The Arab\nstates, themselves humiliated, joined them in this refusal.\nIsrael, for its part, lived within vulnerable cease-fire lines. Its\nnew government, led by Ben Gurion, would accept neither the\nreturn of all the refugees nor the even more vulnerable\ngeography of the original partition scheme. As for the Great\nPowers, they were divided and irresolute in their approach.\nWhen in 1952, Gamal Abdul Nasser took power in Egypt,\ndeposing the corrupt King Farouk, a new Arab champion\n9\nIn 1941, the British had been obliged to suppress a pro-Nazi putsch in\nIraq; in 1944, King Farouk in Egypt was forced at \"tankpoint\" to dismiss\na government suspected of German sympathies.\nthis occasion Stalin and Truman found themselves in greater\nagreement than the Truman White House and the U.S. State\nDepartment. State's diplomats argued against partition up until the final\nvote, when Truman intervened directly to reverse what was believed to be\nU.S. policy. See David McCollough, Truman, (New York: Simon &\nSchuster, 1992).\nINTRODUCTION TO THE ARAB-ISRAELI CONFLICT 9\nappeared on the scene. A professional soldier, Nasser had\nfought in 1948 against Israel. He believed in Egypt's destiny to\nunite the Arabs under his leadership, and he was quite\ndetermined to cut down both British and U.S. influence in the\nprocess, even if it meant drawing Soviet power to his side. In\nhis view, and in the new theology of pan-Arab unity, Israel\nwas but a creature and a device of Western imperialism. The\nliberation of Palestine was therefore part and parcel of the\nliberation from imperialist domination.\nNasser used the Cold War rivalry between the U.S. and the\nUSSR to leverage his antagonism to the British, who vacated\nthe Suez Canal base, their last strategic stronghold, in 1954.\nSimultaneously, he mounted increasing pressure on the\nWestern regional system: the Jordanian and Iraqi monarchies;\nthe Baghdad Pact, consisting of Britain, Iraq, Iran, Turkey and\nPakistan, organized partly at American request to oppose Soviet\ninfluence, but seen by Nasser as aimed at him; the Saudi and\nprincely families of the Gulf. Nor would Nasser be outbid by\nhis Syrian rivals in pan-Arab zeal. As for Israel, Egypt used the\nrefugee-filled Gaza strip it had occupied after the 1948 war as a\nlaunching pad to encourage Palestinian raids on the Jewish\nstate.11 Thus, the Palestinian Arab cause was subsumed under\nthe larger issues of the pan-Arab movement and the outcome of\nNasser's ambitions.\nThese ambitions brought Nasser to war. His seizure of the\nSuez Canal in 1956, following a large infusion of Czech\nweapons the year before that ired the United States, led the\nBritish and French to military action. After months of futile\ndiplomacy to revoke Nasser's act, they were joined by Israel,\nwhose leaders saw in the Soviet-supplied Egyptian military\nbuild-up a growing threat that might overpower the Jewish\nstate's slender margin of safety. But the combined operation\ndid not topple Nasser. Instead, it brought down upon the\n11\n The remaining territories assigned by the UN partition resolution to\nthe Palestinian Arab State had been joined forcibly to Abdullah's\nJordan. Abdullah, assassinated in Jerusalem in 1951, had been succeeded\nby his young grandson Hussein, who ruled uneasily with British\nmilitary aid. For a splendid review of Hussein's subsequent career, see\nUriel Dann, King Hussein's Strategy of Survival (Washington, D.C.: The\nWashington Institute for Near East Policy, Policy Paper No. 29, 1992).\n10 PALESTINIAN SEIJ-GOVERNMENT\ninvaders the wrath of President Eisenhower, who saw in this\napparent reassertion of European imperialism a strategic gift to\nthe Soviets, then forcibly suppressing the Hungarian\nrevolution. American pressure terminated the attack; the\nBritish and French governments fell; and Nasser was saved.12\nIts Western allies humiliated, the U.S. nonetheless did not\nfind a new friend in Egypt. Nasser now ascended to the height\nof his influence, working to expel Western influence\nthroughout the region. Bloody revolution ended the Iraqi\nmonarchy and in both Damascus and Baghdad, Nasserist\nfactions struggled for supremacy. The French were soon\nforced to vacate Algeria. Only Lebanon, defended in 1958 by a\nU.S. marine expedition; King Hussein of Jordan with his loyal\nBedouin army; and the Saudis did not submit to Nasser,\nthough all hastened to propitiate him.\nThe legacy of America's forceful intervention in the Suez\ncrisis of 1956 was greater responsibility for the \"end-game\":\npreventing another outbreak of war between Israel and the\nArabs. Israel had been the last to withdraw from Egyptian\nterritory in 1957, doing so under American pressure that\nwould ever after be cited by the Arabs as an example of what\nWashington could—and should—do. But Prime Minister Ben\nGurion extracted a letter from President Eisenhower, pledging\nU.S. support for open passage through the Egyptian bordered\nStraits of Tiran, leading to Eilat, Israel's only southern port.13 A\nsmall force of UN peace-keepers had also been inserted into\nSinai as a buffer, with Egyptian forces to be kept at low levels as\na reassurance to Israel. These were not light undertakings for\nthe United States, as events were to prove.\nBetween 1956 and 1967 the regional rivalries persisted, with\nNasser now gaining, now losing ground but becoming ever\nmore indebted to Soviet assistance. Israel, strengthened by a\nlarge influx of Jews forced to flee from neighboring Arab\ncountries, enjoyed strong economic growth, but remained a\n12See Hugh Thomas, Suez, (New York: Harper and Row, 1966) for a short\nbut penetrating account.

Its\nmajor ally was not America but Gaullist France, a strategic\nalliance that gave Paris a strong hand in the region even after\nits long-time imperial rival and occasional partner Britain had\nfaded from the scene.\nThe Palestinian Arabs saw in Nasser their principal hope\nfor deliverance and indeed the Egyptian leader helped create\nthe Palestinian Liberation Organization in 1964 to cement this\nalliance. Meanwhile, the displaced refugees of 1948, even\nwhen they lived in areas granted by the UN to a Palestinian\nstate, such as the West Bank (annexed by Jordan in 1950),\ncontinued in limbo. Most of a generation lived on international\ncharity, an irritant and danger to their neighbors. Many\nsought work in other parts of the Arab world, though few were\naccepted as citizens.\nA decade after his great triumph, Nasser gambled again.\nHis cause had been on the wane and Egypt's economy,\ncombining the worst Soviet and Middle Eastern bureaucratic\npractices, was failing. Then, in the winter and spring of 1967 a\nseries of escalating raids pitting Israel against PLO units and\nthe Syrian air force seemed a goad to Egypt's passivity. The\nSoviets stimulated Nasser's belligerence, believing that the\nincreasingly difficult U.S. war in Vietnam would make for\neasy gains at American expense.\nThe Egyptian leader began well. As in 1956 Nasser stunned\nthe world with arbitrary acts, closing the Straits of Tiran to\nIsraeli traffic and demanding successfully that UN peace\u0002keeping units in Sinai evacuate before advancing Egyptian\narmor. Israel mobilized and appealed to the U.S. on the basis of\nthe Eisenhower letter. But Washington, beleaguered by the\nVietnam War, did not act.\nUnlike Britain and France in 1956, a fully mobilized Israel\ncould not wait months for diplomacy to succeed or fail. Ben\nGurion's successor, Levi Eshkol, was forced to take General\nMoshe Dayan and other political opponents into the cabinet\nand an all-party Israeli Unity Government decided for war. On\nJune 5, 1967, the Israeli Air Force destroyed Egypt's planes on\nthe ground and six days later, Israel had captured all of Sinai to\nthe Canal, all of mandatory Palestine to the Jordan river, and\nthe Syrian Golan Heights from which northern Israel had\nbeen shelled. Above all, the Jewish state had taken Jerusalem\n12 PALESTINIAN SELF-GOVERNMENT\nand the site of the Temple that had been the focus of ancient\nJudaism.\nThe 1967 war was a devastating defeat to pan-Arabists\neverywhere and Nasser's leadership would never recover. The\nSoviet Union also suffered a disastrous blow to its prestige:\nMoscow had helped the Arabs into war but not spared them\ndefeat. On the face of it, the United States had emerged as a\nmajor beneficiary, second only to Israel itself.\nInitially the Israelis seemed prepared to trade much of their\nnew territorial gains for peace.14 This apparently conformed to\nU.S. and Western conceptions of how to solve the problem once\nand for all. Indeed, the formulas found in UN Resolution 242,\npassed by the Security Council on November 22, 1967,\nenvisaged an exchange that would have restored virtually all\nthe prewar lines, but this time with more effective guarantees\nand a formal end to the conflict.15\nIt is doubtful whether Israel would ever have accepted such\na near return to the old geography, but in any event, her\ndiplomacy was never put to the test. The Soviets, badly stung,\nquickly replaced and augmented Nasser's military machine,\nenabling Egypt and the other Arab belligerents to refuse any\nnegotiation at all with Israel. As a consequence, the attempt to\ncarry out Resolution 242, whether through a UN negotiator, the\nFour Power Talks of 1968-1969, or the U.S.-Soviet discussions of\n1969-70, bore no fruit.\nInstead, the Arabs launched a fresh assault with Soviet\nsupport on several fronts. Israeli forces holding the east side of\nthe Suez Canal were attacked in what became known as the\nWar of Attrition. Along the Jordan, there was a different\nphenomenon. Outraged by the Arab defeat in 1967 and the\nineffective resistance of the Egyptian sponsored PLO, a new\ngroup of Palestinians, led by Yasser Arafat, took over the\norganization. Arafat had found a formula to unite the\n1 4\n Ibid.\n1 5The Resolution specifies withdrawal by Israel from \"territories\noccupied\" in the 1967 war. By omitting the definite article in the\nEnglish text (the territories), the sponsors left room for territorial\nadjustments. Israel accepted this version. The Arabs did not, accepting\ninstead the French language text where the definite article appears.\nINTRODUCTION TO THE ARAB-ISRAELI CONFLICT 13\nPalestinians and to distinguish their cause from that of the\nquarreling Arab states. All Palestinian factions, in Arafat's\napproach, could agree that the purpose of the fight was to\ndestroy Israel and to replace it with a Palestinian state, its\ncharacter to be determined only by the Palestinians (these\nideas were expressed in the National Charter of 1968). And\nthrough the principle of \"self-help,\" the new PLO would avoid\nbecoming a captive, dependent on the whims of any one Arab\nruler.\nOver the next two decades, Arafat was able to manipulate\nboth the Palestinian factions and the various Arab regimes to\ngain recognition, vast financial support and a certain\nflexibility, although often at the cost of frantic personal\nmaneuvers. But in 1968, as later, the key to his popularity was\nhis willingness to attack the Israelis, either through guerilla\nwarfare or terrorism. He also attacked the then international\nconsensus on the Palestinian issue, as embodied in Resolution\n242, which had not treated the Palestinians as an independent\npolitical force because at the time they had not been one.\nAccordingly, the Resolution regarded the territories claimed\nby the Palestinians as the subject of negotiation among Israel,\nEgypt and Jordan.\nThe emergence of the Palestinians in their own right, and\nthe absence of visible progress toward a peace settlement\nfollowing the 1967 war set the stage for an even more\ndangerous episode to come.\nSTAGE THREE: THE U.S. TRIES PEACE, THE ARABS\nTRY WAR, THE ISRAELIS ARE SURPRISED,\nAND A PEACE PROCESS BEGINS\nBy 1970, air battles over the Suez Canal threatened direct\nclashes between the Israeli air force and Soviet military\nadvisors. In U.S. President Richard Nixon's view, a Soviet led\ndefeat of Israel was intolerable to U.S. interests. And Israel was\nnow alone, France having broken with her over her decision\nto attack in 1967 against General de Gaulle's advice. Now the\nIsraelis were to find in Washington a strategic relationship\nthey had long sought and desperately needed. The War of\nAttrition opened the door for American military aid to the\nJewish state, and ironically, Moscow helped to open it.\n14 PALESTINIAN SEIJ-GOVERNMENT\nThis aid in the form of advanced fighter aircraft enabled\nGolda Meir to accept a U.S. brokered cease-fire in August 1970.\nBut the cease-fire had its price. To attract Arab agreement, the\nU.S. insisted that all parties reaffirm their agreement to UN\nResolution 242 and that it be the basis upon which Israel, Egypt\nand Jordan would negotiate with one another, under UN\nauspices. This could conceivably have led to Israeli withdrawal\nfrom parts of the West Bank, and Menachem Begin, then\nleader of the political opposition, withdrew from the National\nUnity Government in protest, arguing that Israel should never\nleave that area, known in Jewish history as Judea and Samaria.\nOn the Arab side, Nasser gained a respite without a\nresolution. He died in September, just as the cease-fire began to\nexact its major toll, not on Egypt but on Jordan. For while King\nHussein had accepted the cease-fire terms enthusiastically, the\nPLO refused, seeing it as the beginning of the end for its\nguerilla bases there.\nThe ensuing war between the forces of the monarchy and\nArafat (the Palestinians called it \"Black September\") further\ndeepened U.S.-Israeli cooperation, as both governments worked\nto aid the King. A last minute Syrian intervention on Arafat's\nbehalf was defeated as well, leading to yet another coup in\nDamascus, this one bringing Hafez al-Assad to power. The\nWar of Attrition was over, settled by active American\nintervention.\nInstead of negotiations, however, a long stalemate—\n\"neither war nor peace\"—ensued. Nasser's successor, his Vice\nPresident Anwar Sadat, was regarded as a lightweight with a\nshort life expectancy. He proved to be of much sterner stuff,\nand in 1972, arguing that the Soviet military presence\nburdened Egypt without producing Israeli withdrawal, he\nexpelled nearly 20,000 advisors and waited for a response.\nSadat's act astounded and confused both the Americans and\nthe Israelis. These allies did not see eye to eye on the extent of\nIsraeli withdrawal a negotiation with Sadat might require: the\nIsraeli Labour Government regarded its air bases and\nsettlements in Sinai as vital to security; many civilian and\npara-military settlements were also being put down in areas of\nthe West Bank and Golan on the same justification. Nor did\nthey agree tactically on the terms of even a partial movement\naway from the Canal, which, in any case, would not have\nbeen enough to satisfy the Egyptians.\nINTRODUCTION TO THE ARAB-ISRAELI CONFLICT 15\nAfter a burst of diplomatic activity in 1972, the same \"no\nwar; no peace\" situation prevailed once more. Convinced that\nthis doomed Egypt (and his own rule), Sadat made an alliance\nfor war, reconciling with Nasser's old rivals in Saudi Arabia\nand Syria. He was still the beneficiary of Soviet arms and he\ncould now move without the hindrance of a large Soviet\n\"advisory\" presence.\nOn October 6, 1973, the day of Yom Kippur when most\nIsraelis were at prayer, Egyptian and Syrian forces caught a\ncomplacent Israel (and the United States) by surprise. This was\nnot to be a 1967 style campaign. The Israelis, rapidly\nexhausting their military supplies in halting the Arab\nadvances, were soon begging for U.S. arms aid. And when the\nU.S. supplied it, a Saudi led oil embargo doubled the pressure.\nBefore the war was over, the Israelis staged a remarkable\nmilitary recovery, but in its final days, the U.S. and USSR\ncame close to confrontation.\nNow the full malevolence of the conflict had been revealed\nin global proportions. Nixon and his Secretary of State Henry\nKissinger were determined that these risks not be run again. In\na celebrated series of diplomatic forays (the \"shuttle\ndiplomacy\") Kissinger brokered agreements on separation of\nforces on both the Egyptian and Syrian fronts.16 And that was\nnot the end of it. As an Egyptian journalist quipped, Sadat\nmeant \"to take off with the Russians but to land with the\nAmericans.\" The Egyptian leader had determined that the\nAmericans were essential in the peace diplomacy because of\ntheir alliance with Israel, and he wanted American economic\nassistance as well.\nTwo shifts now became evident. First, Sadat sought to\ndeepen his relationship with Washington to gain territory and\naid although not yet making a formal peace with Israel. This\nwas an historic departure from Nasser's pan-Arab ambition that\nin Sadat's judgment had wrecked Egypt. He was prepared to\nbreak with Moscow if necessary and to break with the Syrians,\ntoo, if they obstructed his course. Unlike any of the other Arab\nleaders, Sadat had begun to conclude that better relations with\nIsrael would actually strengthen his position, instead of the\nHenry A. Kissinger, White House Years, (New York: Little, Brown,\n1979).\n16 PALESTINIAN SETT-GOVERNMENT\nreverse, a revolution in Arab statecraft that in 1977 would\nproduce his dramatic visit to Jerusalem.\nThe second shift was the rise of the PLO to primary\nclaimant of the Palestinian cause. In 1974, before negotiation\ncould begin on the Jordanian front, the Arabs had granted the\nPLO at the Rabat Conference sole representation on the\nPalestinian issue, putting Jordan into the background. The PLO\nsoon found sympathy among the Europeans and others who\nhad been nearly powerless to influence the struggle. Fearing\nan oil embargo, and beset by the PLO terror war that disrupted\ntheir airlines, they supported a role for Arafat in the\npeacemaking. Delphic utterances by the PLO leader\nencouraged many to believe that the Palestinians would\neventually accept the pre-1967 Israel.\nDespite frequent public advice from the Europeans and\nothers, the Israelis were having none of Arafat. When at Soviet\nand PLO insistence, the UN General Assembly passed a\nResolution in 1975 listing Zionism as a form of racism, many\nin Israel and elsewhere were confirmed in their view that the\nPLO's only purpose was to destroy the Jewish state. Prime\nMinister Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli Chief of Staff in 1967 and\nGolda Meir's successor, extracted a pledge from the United\nStates that Washington would not negotiate with the PLO or\nrecognize it unless the PLO accepted Resolutions 242 and 338,\nand Israel's right to exist.17\nAmerica's peacemaking after 1973 had been driven by the\nurgency of war and an oil crisis. In the course of brokering two\ndisengagement agreements on the Egyptian-Israeli front and\none on the Israeli-Syrian front, the U.S. emerged as the prime\nmediator. The peace process had thus become simultaneously\na U.S. method to avoid a repeat of the 1973 disaster, and a\npowerful diplomatic tool to limit or even exclude Soviet\ninfluence. None of these achievements, however, had brought\nIsrael or her Arab neighbors to a formal peace, and there was\nstill no basis for Israeli-Palestinian reconciliation.\nWhen Jimmy Carter succeeded Gerald Ford as President\nin January of 1977, he was determined to move on both fronts.\n1\n'Fo r the full text of the U.S.-Israel Memorandum see The Search for Peace\nin the Middle East, Documents and Statements, (Washington, D.C.: U.S. House\nSubcommittee on Europe and the Middle East, 1979) pp. 15-16.\nINTRODUCTION TO THE ARAB-ISRAELI CONFLICT 17\nHe became the first American President to advocate\nPalestinian political rights to their own \"homeland\" as part of\nan overall U.S. peace plan. But Carter's interest in the\nPalestinians and Sadat's interest in better relations with Israel\nboth seemed to suffer a sharp setback when Menachem Begin\nbecame Prime Minister of Israel in May of 1977.\nA prewar underground leader accused of terrorism against\nboth the British and the Arabs, Begin represented not the\nIsraeli Labour Party familiar to most Americans, but the\nopposition Likud, those who rejected any Israeli withdrawal\nfrom the West Bank. The Likud platform called for accelerated\nsettlement of Jews in these areas, changing the demographic\nbalance to make Palestinian political independence\nimpossible. Yet it was to be this unlikely trio of the underrated\nSadat, the implacable Carter and the misunderstood Begin that\nopened the possibility of peace between Israel and her\nneighbors, and between Israeli Jews and Palestinian Arabs.\nThe agreement they reached, the Camp David Accords of\nSeptember 17, 1978, reinforced the conclusion that if peace\nwere to be achieved, the full faith and credit of the U.S. as\npeacemaker had to be applied. Yet the process showed once\nmore that there remained at the heart of the conflict also the\ndetermination of the Arabs and the Israelis: either to persist\nuntil one or the other prevailed, or to decide that peace must\nbecome the common interest.\nPart of the Camp David Accords offered autonomy or self\u0002rule for the Palestinians. This book relates the origins and\nsubsequent diplomacy of autonomy, and also explores its\ncontribution to Arab-Israeli peace. Autonomy or Palestinian\nself-government cannot be a complete cure for the Arab-Israeli\nstruggle. It cannot end all of the regional rivalries, nor can it\nsecure all of the interests of non-Middle Eastern powers. But it\ncan help to improve relations between the Israelis and the\nPalestinian Arabs—if they want it. And if there is to be a\nchance for lasting peace, U.S. policy must help the parties to\nfind their common interests in easing, if not ending, the\nconflict.\n\nn ORIGINS OF AUTONOMY\nWHAT WAS AUTONOMY AND HOW DID IT ORIGINATE?\nThe concept of Autonomy, or \"Self-Rule for the Palestinian\nArabs,\" was fathered by Menachem Begin, grandfathered by\nhis great mentor Ze'ev Jabotinsky and midwifed into the Camp\nDavid Accords by Jimmy Carter with an assist from Anwar\nSadat. Its conception, birth and subsequent history were very\nmuch a product of evolving views on how to settle the Arab\u0002Israeli conflict, and especially the Palestinian dimension.\nWhen Menachem Begin was unexpectedly elected to the\nIsraeli premiership in May 1977, he was already\nuncomfortably aware of a dramatic change in U.S. policy on\nthe Arab-Israeli conflict. After the 1967 war, Israel had come to\ncontrol not only the territory of Mandatory Palestine up to the\nJordan River, but also the Sinai Peninsula and the Golan\nHeights. United Nations Security Council Resolution 242,\nwhich formally ended hostilities, called for Israeli withdrawal\n\"from occupied territories\" and the establishment of peaceful,\nsecure and recognized borders for all states [See Appendix I].\nWhile the Arab governments and most members of the UN\nargued that Israel must withdraw to the pre-1967 lines, the U.S.\nposition was that the extent of withdrawal was subject to\nnegotiation while the principle of \"territory for peace\" applied\nto all fronts. Then, in the aftermath of the October 1973 war,\nJordan's claim to the territories it had lost six years earlier was\nsupplanted by the PLO's demand for an independent\nPalestinian state.\n19\n20 PALESTINIAN SELF-GOVERNMENT\nIsrael's two major parties were opposed to total (or near total)\nwithdrawal as a condition for peace and certainly opposed to a\nPalestinian state. Immediately after the 1967 War the then\u0002Labour government had offered near-total withdrawal from\nSinai and the Golan, and a two-thirds withdrawal from the\nWest Bank—in return for peace and security.1 But once this\nwas rejected by the Arabs at the Khartoum Summit (August\n1967), successive Labour governments in power until 1977\nmade clear that Israel would insist on substantial border\nchanges on each front. Strategic settlements were planted in\nthe Sinai, the Golan, the West Bank and Gaza. In the West\nBank, known to Israelis by the biblical names of Judea and\nSamaria, almost all of those settlements were placed in the\nJordan Valley, north and south of Jericho, clear of the major\nArab population centers (Kiryat Arba and Kedumin were\nexceptions). Throughout these years, Israel invited the King of\nJordan to a fresh territorial division that would give Israel\nbuffer zones along the Jordan River.\nThe Likud bloc, headed by Menachem Begin, opposed any\nterritorial compromise at all in Judea and Samaria. Likud\nhoped to incorporate the area as part of the historic Land of\nIsrael. A much more aggressive Israeli settlement program in\nthese territories was essential to Likud's program.\nUntil March of 1977, the United States officially advocated a\nJordanian \"option\" for resolving the West Bank issue with\nborder modifications more modest than Labour had in mind.\nYet this position was steadily overtaken by Palestinian political\ndevelopments. In 1974 at Rabat, the Arab states themselves had\ndisqualified Jordan from representing the Palestinians, vesting\nthis right instead in the Palestine Liberation Organization. For\nthree years thereafter, the PLO ascended the ladder of growing\ninternational recognition and attained observer status at the\nUN. Simultaneously, the Arabs, the Soviets and their allies\nsought to isolate Israel and undermine its legitimacy, reaching\na milestone in 1975 when the UN General Assembly resolved\nthat Zionism was a form of racism.\n*See Abba Eban, Abba Eban: An Autobiography, (New York: Random House,\n1977), pp. 436-447: Israel sought peace treaties with Egypt and Syria\n\"based on the former international boundaries with changes for Israel's\nsecurity. ... \"\nORIGINS OF AUTONOMY 21\nThat same year Israel secured American pledges that the\nU.S. would neither recognize nor negotiate with the PLO\nunless the PLO recognized Israel and accepted Resolution 242.\nBut this barrier did not prevent the newly elected U.S.\nPresident Jimmy Carter from declaring in March 1977 his\nsupport for a \"Palestinian Homeland\" as part of a\ncomprehensive settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict—a\nformula the Zionists regarded as a euphemism for statehood.2 It\nwas under these highly alarming circumstances that Begin\ntook office, strongly opposed to both territorial compromise and\na Palestinian state.\nDespite predictions of imminent disaster from both sides,\nboth Carter and Begin avoided a direct clash when the Israeli\nPrime Minister debuted in Washington in July of 1977. Begin\nsidestepped the American attempt to force him to declare that\n242 required some Israeli withdrawal (if not total) on all fronts;\nhe stated instead that his problem was not with the U.S., but\nwith Israel's Arab neighbors. Once the Arabs stepped forward\nto negotiate, these matters could be worked out. Following\nBegin's visit, the U.S. redoubled its efforts throughout that\nsummer to reconvene an international conference—including\nPalestinians—to make a comprehensive settlement.\nOn August 8, 1977, Carter again aroused Israeli\napprehensions by declaring that if the PLO accepted 242, the\nU.S. would open discussions for the purpose of making it a\npartner to a negotiation. Begin was already convinced that\nIsrael needed a \"Palestinian proposal,\" something that offered\na change in the status quo without violating his ideological\nprinciples. He told visiting Secretary of State Cyrus Vance on\nAugust 10 that Israel would give \"our Arab neighbors in Judea,\nSamaria and Gaza full cultural autonomy\" and a choice of\nIsraeli citizenship.3\nBalfour Declaration of 1917 had pledged to facilitate a \"home in\nPalestine\" for the Jewish people, which eventually became the state of\nIsrael.\n^William Quandt, Camp David: Peacemaking and Politics, (Washington:\nBrookings, 1986), p. 92.\n22 PALESTINIAN SELF-GOVERNMENT\n\"TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH\"\nVance was preoccupied with the diplomacy that led to\nSyrian and PLO vetoes over a conference, and the joint U.S.-\nSoviet communique of October 1, 1977 which appeared to grant\nthe USSR a decisive role in the peacemaking. Fearful that\nAmerican policy was putting the entire process into the hands\nof his enemies, Sadat instead pursued direct contacts with\nIsrael. Secret meetings, including one in Morocco between\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan and Hassan Tuhami,\nSadat's agent, convinced Sadat that the Likud Government\nwould trade Sinai for peace. He thereupon embarked on his\nself-declared journey \"to the ends of the earth\" for peace that\nbrought him to Jerusalem on November 19, 1977—to\neveryone's surprise, especially Washington's.4\nSadat made clear from the outset that he had not gone to\nJerusalem to sign less than a comprehensive peace agreement\nwith Israel. He also indicated, however, that Egypt would not\ndo the work of the other Arab states, or the Palestinians, for\nthem. After all, Sadat's initiative was intended to free Egypt of\nthe vetoes of the others who could block peace but who would\nrely on Egypt's willingness to shed its blood in the event of\nwar. Instead he offered Begin a concept of \"full peace\": a\nresumption of Arab sovereignty on every front Israel had\ncaptured in 1967, but with peace and security for Israel. On the\nWest Bank that meant a \"self determination\" that might unite\nthe Palestinian population with Jordan. As for Gaza, there\nEgypt could play a special role.\nBegin could not accept these ideas, and both sides treated\nthe initial exchange as only the beginning of negotiations.\nThe two leaders decided to continue their dialogue at humbler\ndiplomatic levels, in preparation for a summit at the Suez Canal\nport of Ismailia on December 25, 1977, when Begin would\nrespond with his own proposals. On December 2, Dayan met\nTuhami again, hoping to duplicate the success of his earlier\nmeeting, but this time on the Palestinian issue he found the\nEgyptian unbending. Dayan nonetheless gave Tuhami a\n4 For a fuller account of this sequence see Martin Indyk, \"To the Ends of the\nEarth\": Sadat's Jerusalem Initiative, (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard\nCenter for Middle Eastern Studies, 1984).\nORIGINS OF AUTONOMY 23\npreview of what Begin intended to bring to Sadat on the\nPalestinian issue.5\nThe Carter Administration, which had cultivated a close\nrelationship with Sadat, was thoroughly nonplussed by this\nsudden explosion of bilateral activity. After the breakthrough,\nthe President and his men had decided to await events. To\ntheir surprise, it was Begin and not Sadat who showed up first\nto solicit America's help. Specifically, the Israeli Prime\nMinister wanted American support for his new plan of\nPalestinian autonomy.\nSadat's dramatic gesture had put enormous pressure on\nIsrael to negotiate, and Begin had been thinking big—at least\nin his own terms. After Sadat's visit, Begin had dictated his\nplan in secret to his personal aide Yehiel Kadishai. It was an\nelaboration with some crucial changes of a concept developed\nby Begin's personal hero and the Likud's ideological mentor,\nthe controversial early Zionist leader Ze'ev Jabotinsky.\n\"SELF-RULE OF THE NATIONAL MINORITY\"\nBegin's autonomy proposal could not have been unfamiliar\nto the older hands in his own party. In fact, he had taken one\nside of a long-running argument that ran to the earliest period\nof Zionist political history. Begin's scheme invoked the ideas of\nnone other than his party's mentor, Ze'ev Jabotinsky, who, like\nother early Zionist theoreticians, wrestled with the problems\nposed by two turn-of-the-century national minorities: the Jews,\nas they were then domiciled throughout the multinational\nempires of Europe; and the Arabs of Palestine, already opposed\nto burgeoning Zionist settlement.\nJabotinsky believed that nationalism was defined by\npersonal preference—the individual's sense of national\nidentity—rather than by race, place of residence or even\nlanguage. Every individual had rights, and these rights, so\nJabotinsky thought, could be accommodated by a national\nmajority in a manner that respected both national sovereignty\nand minority dignity. This he called \"personal autonomy.\"\nJabotinsky had explored the personal autonomy concept in a\n5\nSee Moshe Dayan, Breakthrough, (New York: Alfred Knopf, 1981),\npp. 93-7.\n24 PALESTINIAN SELF-GOVERNMENT\nthesis that earned him a law degree in 1912, entitled Self-Rule of\nthe National Minority.6\nWhatever his later reputation, Jabotinsky was among the\nvery few early Zionists who concluded that the Arabs living in\nthe land of Israel were in fact a nation with legitimate claims\nthat could never be reconciled with Zionism. Because he\nreasoned that the Jewish historical and national claim to the\nland was superior, he concluded that the Arabs would have to\nbe content with minority self-rule: \"to grant the Arab minority\nin Eretz Israel every possible right that the Jews claimed for\nthemselves, but had never achieved in other countries.\"7\nThere was another competing idea in the 1920s and the\n1930s, especially after the Peel Commission had concluded in\n1937 that partition was the best way to resolve the Arab-Jewish\nconflict: Arab populations who were unwilling to live as a\nminority in the Jewish state, would be \"transferred\" to the\nArab state or states. This idea was more easily accepted because\nmany Zionists did not view the Palestinian Arabs as a separate\nnation, but as a branch of an Arab nation already enjoying\nmany states—including Transjordan, severed from the\nPalestinian Mandate by the British to accommodate their\nWorld War I Hashemite Arab allies from the Arabian\npeninsula.8 Ultimately, by this reasoning, there might be a\nrepeat of the Turkish-Greek settlement of 1923, which finally\nresolved one of the more murderous ethnic problems of\nmodern times.9\n^See Ze'ev Jabotinsky, \"Self-Rule of the National Minority,\" Writings,\n(Jerusalem: Book Publishing Company [Hebrew], 1950).\n'Quoted in Yaacov Shavit, Jabotinsky and the Revisionist Movement 1925-1948,\n(London: Frank Cass Ltd., 1988), p. 258.\n\"The occasionally entertaining circumstances surrounding the\nestablishment of the then-Amir (later King) Abdullah in Transjordan\nare related in Sir Alec Kirkbride, A Crackle of Thorns: Experiences in the\nMiddle East, (London: John Murray, 1956).\n\"After Israel was established, most of the Jewish communities in the\nArab countries moved in fear of their lives to the new State; many\nIsraelis thus claimed that this population exchange had indeed taken\nplace, the Jews of Arabia having traded places with the Arabs of\nPalestine.\nORIGINS OF AUTONOMY 25\nAlthough he thought voluntary, albeit encouraged, transfer\nwas desirable, Jabotinsky rejected \"forced transfer\" as both\nimmoral and impractical. He settled on the Self-Rule concept\nas the best solution. All would enjoy common citizenship in\nthe Zionist polity, but the Arabs would be free to cultivate Home\nRule and their unique cultural and religious institutions. And\nit was this concept, hallowed by Jabotinsky's authority, that\nBegin chose to elaborate.10\nBegin devised a plan that he originally described as\n\"Home-Rule.\" The Likud leader's proposal, however, also\ncontained a major departure from Jabotinsky. Instead of\nJabotinsky's Self-Government under Israeli sovereignty, Begin\ndecided to leave the question of sovereignty open,11 offering the\nresidents instead a choice of Israeli or Jordanian citizenship.\nChecking with Aharon Barak, his Attorney General, who had\nbeen asked to develop the plan's detail, the legally-minded\nBegin discovered that this alteration raised an important\nproblem. What would be the source of legal authority for the\npowers granted the Home-Rule? If it were the Israeli Military\nGovernment, that would require its retention in some form, yet\nBegin desired to dispense with the Military Government,\nsymbol of an abnormal situation.12\nAside from its ideological merits, self-government/\nautonomy/Home-Rule for the Palestinians had another\nadvantage. Demographically, a decision by the Arabs in the\nterritories to adopt Israeli citizenship en masse could trigger a\n^Writing in the Hebrew newspaper Ha'aretz on Feb. 4, 1988, the veteran\nLand Of Israel Movement activist Israel Eldad quoted Begin as saying as\nearly as 1975: \"Sinai is not Eretz Yisrael and we shall give the Arabs\nautonomy.\" Autonomy, Begin explained, was Jabotinsky's position at the\n1906 Zionist Helsinki Conference which had debated the question of how\nto deal with local Arab opposition to Zionism. Quoted in Ehud Sprinzak,\nThe Ascendance of Israel's Radical Right, (New York: Oxford University\nPress, 1991), p. 331, n. 7. See also Ze'ev B. Begin, \"A Vision for Israel at\nPeace,\" Foreign Affairs, Fall 1991, p. 33. Begin, the Prime Minister's son,\nconfirms the origin of autonomy in Jabotinsky's writings.\n11\n See Begin, Foreign Affairs, p.33: \". . . Arab autonomy is not now\nconceived as under Israeli sovereignty. This was a far reaching leap in\nLikud thinking and is a significant concession on its part.\"\n12See Quandt, op. tit., p. 155 for an account of this background.\n26 PALESTINIAN SELF-GOVERNMENT\npolitical disaster; the Arabs might soon hold the swing vote.\nBut if they were granted a local self-government distinct from\nnational sovereignty and a choice of Jordanian citizenship, this\ndire prospect could be avoided. In short, personal autonomy for\nthe Arabs of the West Bank and Gaza, to Begin's mind,\nrecognized their just minority rights without running the\ninternational or domestic political risks of incorporating a\nrestive Palestinian population into the Israeli polity.\nBEGIN GOES TO WASHINGTON\nWhen the Israeli Prime Minister arrived in Washington\non December 16, he found the Carter Administration wary that\nhis surprise visit was intended to outflank Sadat. And Begin\ndid indeed solicit support for Home-Rule, stressing these key\npoints: 1) sovereignty claims would be set aside or left open; 2)\nthere would be free elections for an Arab \"Administrative\nCouncil\" with limited powers; 3) Israel would retain\nresponsibility for security, and 4) there would be elements of\nreciprocity between Israel and the Council regarding issues\nsuch as land purchases, settlement, immigration and water\ndevelopment. Admitting that the source of authority was a\nsticky legal problem, Begin attributed it nonetheless to the\nIsraeli Military Government as the ultimate authority. This\narrangement, Begin suggested, would be permanent.\nVance, Brzezinski, Carter and their aides were dubious\nabout the proposed \"Home-Rule\" because, in their view, it\ncould be no substitute for Israeli withdrawal and the\nassumption of an Arab sovereignty over the areas, a final\noutcome to which they were committed by their reading of\n242.13 They urged Begin to present it as a transitional or\ninterim scheme, not a permanent solution, a position he had\nno difficulty in accepting because his plan contained a\n\"review\" option after five years—a year beyond the maximum\ntime an Israeli parliament could serve before new elections\nwere required. If autonomy was indeed merely transitional,\n*\n3\nSee Cyrus Vance, Hard Choices: Critical Years in America's Foreign Policy,\n(New York: Simon and Schuster, 1983), p. 54. Also pp. 196-98.\nORIGINS OF AUTONOMY 27\nthen the Americans saw Begin's proposals as a \"step\nforward.\"14\nNSC Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski thought Begin's idea had\npossibilities, but, interestingly, his suggested improvements\nwould have turned Autonomy into a kind of \"Israeli Mandate\"\nfor a Palestinian state. (Brzezinski himself had advocated a\ndemilitarized Palestinian state several years earlier.) The\nmilitary government, he argued, should be replaced by an\nauthority with other participatory powers, such as Jordan or the\nUN. A specifically UN presence would help to reinforce the\nidea that the transition scheme was based on 242, and a\nPalestinian \"assembly\" could meet in East Jerusalem to\nindicate that that area was part of the transition.1!\" (Begin's plan\nhad placed the seat of \"self-rule\" in Bethlehem.)\nBegin left Washington persuaded of Carter's initial support\nfor a transitional scheme, and he tried out the idea on British\nPrime Minister Callaghan in London with similar results.\nContaining 26 points, the plan was then retitled, at Dayan's\nurging, as \"Self-Rule for Palestinian Arabs, Residents of Judea,\nSamaria and the Gaza District which will be Instituted upon the\nEstablishment of Peace.\" [See Appendix III]\nThe Israeli Foreign Minister, who had also influenced\nBegin to be more specific about Jordan's role, had his own\nideas on autonomy. These were similar to Begin's insofar as\ngiving local government to the Palestinians, but predicated on\na desire 1) to hold the areas through Jewish settlement,\neconomic ties and joint infrastructure, while separating them\npolitically from Israel so as to retain the Jewish character of the\nstate; 2) to give the Arabs \"functional\" responsibility for local\npolitics and administration; and 3) to make Jordan a political\n'^Quandt, op. cit., p. 157. In the first misunderstanding between the two\nleaders, Begin later claimed that Carter had agreed that the Israeli\nautonomy proposal was a \"fair basis for negotiation.\" Carter thought this\nwas exaggerated, especially because in Carter's opinion, the autonomy\nproposal Begin put to Sadat was \"attenuated substantially.\" See Jimmy\nCarter, Keeping Faith: Memoirs of a President, (New York: Bantam, 1982), p.\n300. Quandt disagrees with Carter, arguing that the proposals were\nsubstantially the same. See Quandt, op. cit., p. 158.\n^Zbigniew Brzezinski, Power and Principle, (New York: Farrar, Strauss,\nGiroux, 1983), pp. 118-19.\n28 PALESTINIAN SELF-GOVERNMENT\nfocus for the Palestinians who could not find such an outlet in\nIsrael.\n\"Functional co-existence,\" in Dayan's view, could best be\nembodied politically by autonomy or self-rule for the Arabs.\nHe was convinced that continued Israeli military rule or the\nextension of Israeli law and administration over an innately\nhostile population would produce disaster.16 Ezer Weizman,\nthen Begin's Defense Minister, would later crystallize this idea\neven further: \"They [the Palestinians] can have their own\nauthorities and run their own affairs as they see fit—just as\nlong as they do not threaten us.\"17\n16See Dayan, op. cit., pp. 303-04 on this theme.\n17Ezer Weizman, Battle for Peace, (New York: Bantam, 1981), p.\nm \"A LITTLE AIR\":\nAUTONOMY AND CAMP DAVID\nBegin's autonomy plan had extricated the Prime Minister\nfrom the straitjacket of the Likud's territorial claim by\ndeferring the application of the claim itself. This was painful\nbut not politically fatal. But the secret preparation of the plan\nand Begin's penchant for using grandiose adjectives in\ndescribing it aroused apprehension across party lines. The\ncharge stuck that it would create the institutional foundation of\na Palestinian state,1 leading the Prime Minister to be\nhypersensitive about anything that suggested \"sovereign\"\npowers or symbols. Nonetheless, autonomy did establish a\nsingular Israeli benchmark: a Begin/Likud-sponsored change\nin the status quo that did not increase, and in fact would\ndecrease, both Israel's military presence and its administrative\ncontrol.\nAutonomy's international debut, however, played to less\nthan rave reviews. Travelling to Ismailia on December 25,\n1977, Begin unveiled his plan to Sadat, who had already heard\nthe general provisions of the plan from both Tuhami and\nCarter. The atmosphere, devoid of any symbolic welcome for\nthe Israelis, was made further surreal when Sadat began the\nmeeting by swearing in his new Foreign Minister (his\n^See United States Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS)\nDecember 28, 29, 30, 1977 for accounts of the Knesset (parliamentary)\ndebate.

Begin rose (or sank) to\nthe occasion. As Ezer Weizman recounted it, Begin offered a\nlong presentation on a peace treaty with Egypt and then, with\nhardly a pause, treated a crowded, overheated room of officials\nto an equally detailed reading of his 26 point autonomy\nproposal, concluding his remarks by invoking the\ninternational legal authorities of his law studies in pre-war\nPoland, Lauterpacht and Oppenheim. \"Sadat clapped his\nhands, and a waiter appeared. 'Iftach al Shubach, Open the\nwindow,' the President commanded. A little air entered the\nsmoke-filled chamber.\"2\nYet the \"little air\" let in by the autonomy plan was enough\nto inflate the tires of the peace process. It would eventually\nenable Sadat and the Americans to justify a separate peace as\nnot separate at all. It allowed Begin to offer something for the\nPalestinians without fatally impairing his political support. In\nfact, it did everything expected of it except provide autonomy\nfor the Palestinians, not least because they violently rejected\nthe concept.\nAUTONOMY MAKES THE DEAL\nAfter Ismailia, the Egyptian-Israeli direct negotiations\nreached a complete impasse. The full story of how the United\nStates intervened to aid the talks, eventually culminating in the\nextraordinary sessions at Camp David, need not be retold here.\nSuffice it to say that the fortunes of Begin's autonomy proposals\nwere affected by three events. First, Carter's trip to Aswan to\nconfer with Sadat in January 1978, produced a crucial\ncompromise on Egypt's insistence that Israel recognize\nPalestinian self-determination. Israel eventually came to accept\nthe Carter formula, the Palestinian right \"to participate in the\ndetermination of their own future\" which was written into the\nCamp David Accords. Second, at a meeting in Leeds Castle\nbetween the Foreign Ministers of Egypt and Israel in June\n1978, Dayan was able to fashion agreement on a number of\nconcepts: a five year duration for autonomy, as a transitional\narrangement; a \"withdrawal\" of the Israeli Military\nGovernment; elections for a Palestinian self-government;\n2Ezer Weizman, Battle for Peace, (New York: Bantam, 1981), p. 132.\n\"A LITTLE AIR\": AUTONOMY AND CAMP DAVID 31\nretention by Israel of security rights; and a special role for\nJordan in the arrangement, apart from an Israeli-Jordanian\nnegotiation over a separate peace treaty. Third, on August 13,\n1978 in the preliminary discussions before Camp David, the\nU.S. team decided that a refashioned autonomy was the only\nway to facilitate an overall Egyptian-Israeli agreement.\nIt is worth quoting in full the words of William Quandt, the\nNSC staff member who recorded the U.S. position:\nThe key idea was to refashion Begin's autonomy plan\ninto a proposal that would offer the Palestinians a serious\nmeasure of self-government. The proposal would include\na clear commitment to a second phase of negotiations\ntoward the end of the transitional period to resolve the\nquestions of borders, sovereignty and Palestinian rights\nin accordance with UN resolution 242—territory for\npeace—and Carter's promise at Aswan that Palestinians\nshould have the right to participate in determining their\nown future.^\nA MISTY PENUMBRA\nIt is illuminating to compare these points with the\ndocuments finally signed at Camp David on September 17,\n1978 and with Begin's original 26 point presentation to the\nKnesset on December 28, 1977:\n• Begin's plan had originally called for \"administrative\nautonomy\" to be run by an eleven-member \"Administrative\nCouncil\" with its seat in Bethlehem. The Camp David Accords\ncall for \"full autonomy\" to be run by a \"Self-Governing\nAuthority (Administrative Council)\", whose location and size\nare unspecified.\n• Begin's plan urged that claims to sovereignty be left\nopen \"for the sake of peace,\" while Camp David stipulated two\nstages: autonomy first and then negotiations on the final status\nof the territories beginning no later than the third year of the\nfive year autonomy.\n• Begin's plan abolished the military \"administration\"\nbut not the military government; Camp David \"withdraws\" the\nmilitary government and it is \"replaced.\"\n^William Quandt, Camp David: Peacemaking and Politics, (Washington:\nBrookings, 1986), pp. 212-213.\n32 PALESTINIAN SELF-GOVERNMENT\n• Begin's plan would have Israel devolve autonomy on\nthe Palestinians, while in Camp David a complex negotiation\ninvolving Israel, Egypt, Jordan, the Palestinians and the U.S.\nwould establish the autonomy and a continuing committee\nwould also be created to supervise it, among other duties.\n• Begin's plan offered the residents of the West Bank and\nGaza a choice of Israeli or Jordanian citizenship and the right\nto vote for the Knesset or the Jordanian Parliament, and a joint\nIsraelijordanian Committee to harmonize legislation with the\nPalestinian Administrative council that was to be created.\nNone of this \"confederal overture\" appears in Camp David,\nthus giving the inhabitants of the Self-Governing Authority a\nstatus more independent of both Israel and Jordan.\n• Begin's plan put security and public order among Israeli\nresponsibilities. Camp David calls for a \"strong local police\nforce\" with possible Jordanian participation, and withdrawal of\nIsraeli security forces to specified locations.\n• Begin's plan embraced an \"open borders\" concept;\nallowing for an Israeli right to purchase land and settle in the\nareas and a Palestinian right to purchase land and settle in\nIsrael—if the Palestinian purchaser is an Israeli citizen. Again,\nnone of this appeared in Camp David, and the settlements\nissue, as we shall see, continued to bedevil the proceedings.\n• Finally, the Begin plan provided for a joint Israel\u0002Jordan-Palestinian Administrative Council Committee to\ndecide unanimously on \"norms of immigration\" for Arab\nrefugees who wished to return. Camp David added Egypt and\ngave to a \"continuing committee\" the task of agreeing \"on the\nmodalities of admission of persons displaced from the West\nBank and Gaza in 1967, together with necessary measures to\nprevent disruption and disorder.\"\nThe final Camp David provisions also added a lengthy\nexposition of how the Palestinians would at each stage\nparticipate \"in the determination of their own future\" and the\nachievement of their \"legitimate rights\": as part of the\ndelegations negotiating the autonomy; through the elections of\na self-governing authority; and through negotiating the final\nstatus. These provisions clearly reflect the impact of the\nAmerican (and Egyptian) desire to turn Begin's autonomy\ninto a transitional corridor leading to an Arab sovereignty. The\nCamp David Accords themselves, of course, do not spell that\nout, taking refuge instead in a \"creative ambiguity.\" What\n\"A LITTLE AIR\": AUTONOMY AND CAMP DAVID 33\nhappened immediately afterwards, however, indicated that\nnone of the would-be peacemakers could leave this ambiguity\nalone.\nLater, when Ambassador Sol Linowitz, Carter's second\nSpecial Negotiator, read through the President's personal notes\non the Camp David Accords he was struck by the complexity\nof it all, and also by the myriad possibilities for\nmisunderstanding.4 An Israeli law professor took it further,\nconcluding that \"this misty penumbra of formulational\nambiguity was created deliberately.\"5 And in fact there is\nplenty of evidence from the recollections of the participants\nthat rather than stall the proceedings over clarifications to the\nautonomy proposal, Carter, Sadat and Begin preferred to\nconcentrate on Israeli military withdrawal from Sinai, the fate\nof Israeli settlements in the Sinai, security provisions in the\nsouth, and the extent of Egyptian-Israeli normalization.6\nThe conclusion of the Accords [See Appendix IV], after so\nmany days of sometimes desperate negotiation, did not inspire\nan immediate feeling of triumph. Instead, there was a sense of\nforeboding and of work yet to be done.7 This malaise dissipated\nsomewhat in the public ceremony following the agreement,\nbut even that grand occasion could not disguise the serious\ntroubles ahead. Carter, in particular, had taken upon himself to\nact as a \"full partner\" and also to bring Saudi Arabia and\nJordan into the negotiations. But on September 19, only two\ndays after the Accords were signed, the Saudis said that Camp\nDavid \"cannot be regarded as an acceptable final formula for\npeace.\" And this was not the only problem. The President and\nhis men were also still determined to rectify any Israeli\nbacksliding on ultimate satisfaction of minimal Palestinian\n^Personal interview with Ambassador Linowitz.\n*Amos Shapira in Yoram Dinstein, ed., Models of Autonomy, (New\nBrunswick: Transaction Books, 1981), p. 285.\n^See Quandt's summary after ten days of negotiation and Carter's\nchoices, op. cit., pp. 235-36. Also p. 244 on the decision to \"fuzz over the\nissue\" of UNSC 242's application to the final status negotiations over the\nWest Bank and Gaza.\n7Quandt, op. cit., pp. 253-54.\n34 PALESTINIAN SELF-GOVERNMENT\ninterests as they defined them. In other words, as Vance said\nof Begin's original autonomy presentation, it could not become\na substitute for necessary Israeli withdrawal.8\nAs it turned out, both the U.S. and Israel hastened to clarify\nthe misty penumbra, with disastrous results for the inaugural\nstage of the autonomy negotiations.\nTHE PEACEMAKERS FIGHT\nA critical diplomatic weakness in the Camp David Accords\nwas their incompleteness. In essence, Sadat and Begin were\nnot taking home a peace treaty or an autonomy agreement, but\nonly frameworks for reaching them. They, and Carter as well,\nwould have to defend the not-yet-finished arrangements while\nsimultaneously negotiating to finish them. In short, the\nAccords signalled to the opposition what might be coming but\nhad not yet arrived.\nBegin stood to be the biggest winner if he could secure real\npeace with Egypt without yielding the West Bank, and this\neventuality was implicit in Sadat's own approach of not\nallowing the Palestinian issue to stymie Egypt's pursuit of her\nvital interests. But Begin had not reached his goal yet, and\nCarter was determined to show that the U.S. would not endorse\nanything less than a comprehensive peace. Otherwise,\nAmerica's ability to attract others to the deal would be fatally\nimpaired. Finally, Sadat had thrown himself into the arms of\nboth Carter and Begin, reasoning that both had every interest\nin making him a winner.\nFrederick the Great once observed that while Austrian\nEmpress Maria Theresa had opposed the partition of Poland on\nmoral grounds, when Prussia and Russia decided to go ahead\nwith it anyhow, \"she wept but she took.\" There was something\nof this sentiment in the American approach to the Camp David\nAccords. Carter \"wept and took\" the Accords while almost\nimmediately thereafter trying to portray autonomy as a\ncorridor to Arab sovereignty. Begin's \"weeping\" began when\nhe discovered that, Jabotinsky notwithstanding, the autonomy\n\"Cyrus Vance, Hard Choices: Critical Years in America's Foreign Policy, (New\nYork: Simon and Schuster, 1983), pp. 196-98.\n\"A LITTLE AIR\": AUTONOMY AND CAMP DAVID 35\nproposal divided his party and forced him to rely on the Labour\nopposition to get the Camp David Accords through the Knesset.\n(Among prominent members of the Likud, Moshe Arens voted\nagainst while Yitzhak Shamir as speaker of the Knesset\nabstained, after making his opposition clear). Or as one Israeli\nwit put it, Begin offered up the Camp David autonomy before\nJabotinsky's portrait and the portrait said, \"What have you\ndone, my son?\"\nAccused by his critics of preparing the way for a\nPalestinian state even before securing a peace with Egypt,\nBegin quickly reverted to his original autonomy ideas. The\nAmericans helped speed the way through three controversial\nepisodes: the Carter-Begin argument over settlements; the\nSaunders Mission; and above all, the written answers provided\nto a series of questions posed by Jordan's King Hussein.\nThe ink on the Camp David Accords was barely dry when\nPresident Carter and Prime Minister Begin fell into a hot\ncontroversy over \"who said what\" on the ever-touchy issue of\nIsraeli settlements. Carter believed that he had extracted from\nBegin a settlements freeze for the duration of the autonomy\nnegotiations. Begin asserted that all he had agreed to was a\nfreeze for the three months the parties had stipulated for\nachieving a peace treaty (and for that matter, completing the\nautonomy negotiations as well). This very public quarrel\nembarrassed Carter and Begin at the very moment both sides\nwere trying to \"sell\" the deal to skeptical audiences—Carter to\nthe Arabs and Begin to his own party.9\nAssistant Secretary of State Harold Saunders was dispatched\nto the area to preach Camp David's virtues to the Arabs and in\nparticular to the Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza. They,\nalong with the \"outside\" PLO leadership, had been quick to\nreact. Arafat warned that anyone supporting Sadat would \"pay\na high price\" and later described autonomy as \"no more than\nmanaging the sewers.\"10 On September 18, 1978, the PLO\n^See Quandt, op. cit., pp. 248-50. He concludes that Begin originally\nmeant three months tied to successful resolution of the autonomy talks but\nlater tied it to the peace treaty. Dayan, on September 19, two days after\nthe quarrel began, noted that Israel had in any case no plans to build\nany settlements for the next 90 days.\nl\"For Arafat's comments see Al Sharq' al-Awsal, October 25, 1978 and May\n25, 1979.\n36 PALESTINIAN SELF-GOVERNMENT\nExecutive Committee announced its \"total rejection\" of the\nAccords. On October 1, 1978, one hundred leading Palestinians\nfrom the Occupied Territories had publicly declared autonomy\nto be \"an open plot\" against Palestinian rights, especially that of\nself-determination.\"11 Apparently attempting to counter the\nargument that autonomy foreclosed Arab sovereignty,\nSaunders was quoted in the Hebrew press as saying that the\nareas \"should return to Arab sovereignty\"; even if not\naccurately quoted, his efforts further angered the Israeli\ngovernment. 1 2 Whatever he said, however, paled by\ncomparison with the detailed positions provided by the Carter\nAdministration to the King of Jordan in October.\nOn September 19, Jordan had reiterated the \"principles\"\nthat would \"govern its attitude\" toward the Accords but offered\nto withhold final judgement until a more intensive \"appraisal\"\ncould be made. This took the form of a Royal Questionnaire\naddressed to Washington.\nThe Carter administration hoped that precise answers to the\nKing's questions about autonomy would elicit his support.\nAmong the more noteworthy American clarifications were:\n(1) The \"source of authority\" would be the international\nagreement itself and the \"continuing committee\" of Egypt,\nIsrael and Jordan as the Camp David Accords established. (2)\nThe Palestinian delegates on the Egyptian and Jordanian\nnegotiating teams could include \"other Palestinians as\nmutually agreed\" (the Camp David Accords formula), who\nmust accept UN Security Council Resolution 242 and be\nprepared to live in peace with Israel (a position which excluded\nthe PLO). (3) While the self-governing authority covered the\nWest Bank and Gaza, it was \"not realistic to expect that the full\nscope of the Self-Governing Authority can be extended to East\nJerusalem during the transitional period.\" Nonetheless,\nPalestinians of East Jerusalem who are not Israeli citizens\nshould \"participate in the elections to constitute the self\u0002governing authority and in the work of the self-governing\nauthority itself.\" (4) The Israeli settlers and settlements\nalso the political critique by Faisal Husseini in Shu'un Filastiniya No.\n84 (Nov. 1978) concluding that \"Sadat had sold the cause of Palestine.\"\nliHa'aretz, October 26, 1978.\n\"A LITTLE AIR\": AUTONOMY AND CAMP DAVID 37\nalthough not mentioned in the Camp David framework, \"will\nhave to be dealt with in the course of those negotiations\" (both\nfor transitional and final status). (5) Aside from reasserting its\nown interpretation of 242 (land for peace on all fronts) the U.S.\nalso pledged to be \"a full partner\" in the negotiations, with\nPresident Carter taking \"an active personal part\".\nFinally, the Administration described its own concept of a\ntransitional period: \"We see the transitional period as essential\nto build confidence, gain momentum and bring about the\nchanges in attitude that can assure a final settlement which\nrealizes the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people while\nassuring the security of Israel and of the other parties.\"13\nThese developments reinforced Begin's difficulties with his\nown party and even with the Labour opposition.14 The sum total\nof America's actions definitely suggested that autonomy was a\ncorridor leading to a reassertion of Arab sovereignty. The\nPrime Minister, who was having enough difficulty securing\nthe Peace Treaty itself, had never conceived autonomy to be\nanything of the sort. As the Americans attempted to expand its\nmeaning, Begin was trying to contract it. By and large, Sadat\nstood aside from this quarrel, which he viewed as American\nbusiness with Israel.\nAt the end of October, the Israeli Cabinet decided to\n\"strengthen\" existing settlements, which was also the best way\nfor Begin to strengthen the Likud coalition and rebuke the\nAmericans. A committee chaired by the Director-General of\nBegin's office, Eliyahu Ben-Elissar, was established to create\nIsrael's \"detailed\" plan—a rebuff to the answers provided by\nthe U.S. to the King of Jordan. Its report, never published, was\nreported to be a restatement of Begin's original intent: the\nsource of authority was to be the military government;\nautonomy meant autonomy of the person—the \"inhabitants\"—\nnot the land; land and water resources were to be controlled by\nIsrael, although water would be administered by a \"joint\nof the quotes are from Quandt's appendix H, op. cit., pp. 388-96. His\nsource is a copy made available by the government of Jordan, minus\nCarter's signature, the original being classified.\n14Itamar Rabinovich, \"The Autonomy Plan,\" Middle East Contemporary\nSurvey, Volume III: 1978-79, (New York: Holmes and Meier, 1979), p.\n170.\n38 PALESTINIAN SELF-GOVERNMENT\nauthority\"; new settlements were most emphatically\npermitted.15\nNone of this was attractive to the Palestinians or the\nJordanians, who continued to reject Camp David. The U.S. and\nIsrael fought over autonomy just as the essential details of the\nEgyptian-Israeli treaty were being worked out. That treaty had\nits own complications, taking five months and Carter's\npersonal intervention to conclude. Finally, when push came to\nshove on the treaty, all three partners decided to put aside the\nautonomy problem for another day—the basic decision they\nhad made at Camp David, that they would reaffirm at the\nPeace Treaty signing and that they would reaffirm once more\nthree years later when the moment arrived for the final Israeli\nwithdrawal from Sinai.\nThus, on March 26, 1979, Begin and Sadat wrote a letter to\nCarter agreeing to begin autonomy negotiations within a\nmonth of the Peace Treaty's ratification. The letter itself, the\nproduct of excruciating negotiations, repeated the essentials of\nthe Camp David framework, renewed an invitation to Jordan to\nparticipate and then added these provisions: (1) Egypt and\nIsrael would negotiate an agreement even if Jordan did not\nparticipate; (2) the goal of these \"continuous\", \"good faith\"\nnegotiations should be agreement within one year \"so that\nelections will be held as expeditiously as possible . . . ;\" (3) the\nUnited States would participate \"fully in all stages of\nnegotiations.\"16 [See Appendix V]\n15Ibid, p. 171.\n^According to one participant, Egypt and the U.S. raised the issue of\npolitical \"linkage\" for the first time during the discussions preceding\nagreement on the letter. \"Linkage\" meant that if there should be no\nresolution of the autonomy issue, then Egyptian-Israeli relations could\nsuffer. The Israelis thought they had settled this at Camp David, i.e., that\nthe Peace Treaty stood by itself.\nIV THE \"GOOD FAITH\" NEGOTIATIONS:\n1979-1980\nTrue to their word, one month after their Peace Treaty the\nEgyptians and Israelis, with their American partner, began to\nnegotiate the meaning of the Self-Governing Authority\n(Administrative Council) as ordained by the Camp David\nAccords. They continued to do so, off and on, for three years.\nDuring that time, only Begin remained continuously in office;\nSadat was murdered and succeeded by his Vice President\nHosni Mubarak while Carter lost the 1980 election to Ronald\nReagan. Three American \"Personal Representatives,\" or\nSpecial Negotiators, tried their hand with varying success\nalthough there was considerable continuity at the working\nlevel amongst all of the teams.\nThe negotiations themselves may be divided into two\nstages. Stage I, 1979-80, began badly when the Americans tried\nto attract PLO support, but finished better once the second\nSpecial Negotiator, Sol Linowitz, concentrated on bringing\nIsrael and Egypt to agreement on functional issues. Stage II,\n1981-82, started late because Sadat refused to resume\nnegotiations until after the Israeli election of June 1981. Begin\nand Sadat's joint determination in August 1981 to finish the\nnegotiations by year's end engendered some progress but\nSadat's murder two months later threw Egyptian resolve in\ndoubt. By January 1982, U.S. Secretary of State Haig knew that\nneither Egypt nor Israel wanted the autonomy negotiations to\nimpede the final Israeli withdrawal from Sinai.\nIt was then left to the third Special Negotiator, Richard\nFairbanks, to isolate the underlying divisions between the\n39\n40 PALESTINIAN SELF-GOVERNMENT\nparties and to prepare so-called bridging proposals. American\nplans to run a kind of Camp David II, however, fell victim to\nthe Lebanon war and on August 16, 1982, Egypt suspended the\nnegotiations pending an Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon and\na \"new concept.\" The U.S. proposals reappeared in part through\nthe talking points that accompanied the Reagan Plan of\nSeptember 1, 1982. Even though Autonomy was invoked as the\nsubject of negotiations, that Plan shifted the focus decisively to\nthe Jordan option and autonomy was relegated to the archives\nuntil the late 1980s when the entire concept was revived.\nThroughout, several important political tendencies were to\nbe observed among all the parties.\n(1) Different Concepts: Egypt tried to dress the self-governing\nauthority in the swaddling clothes of Palestinian sovereignty;\nIsrael in the tightly fitted coat of a purely administrative\nautonomy, and the U.S. as a seasonal suit, to be worn\ntemporarily and in all probability, to be succeeded by the\nmantle of an Arab sovereignty (Palestinian-Jordanian) for\nmost of the territories.\n(2) The Empty Chairs: In the absence of the Palestinians or\nthe Jordanians, neither Egypt nor Israel were inclined to reach\n\"final\" agreements. The Egyptians did not feel able to yield\nwhat they felt were the rights of those not present while the\nIsraelis for their part had no reason to settle on a position that\nmight require further change when (and if) the missing\nparties joined a negotiation. The United States was tempted to\nsomehow \"associate\" the PLO or Jordan with the talks to supply\nmissing links; these attempts usually served to drive the\nEgyptians and the Israelis apart.\n(3) Disturbing Linkage: Although the autonomy provisions\nand the Egyptian-Israeli treaty were part of a comprehensive\nframework, each held independent legal validity. Beginning\nwith the negotiations over the Sadat-Begin letter and\nthroughout 1980-81, however, the U.S. and Egypt argued that\nthe lack of agreement on autonomy would harm Egyptian\u0002Israeli relations. Then, Israel's pressure for agreement on\nautonomy, as the date for Sinai withdrawal approached, led\nEgypt and the U.S. to fear that lack of agreement might impede\nthe withdrawal itself. In both instances, as in every other crisis\nof the negotiations, all parties resolved on the primacy of the\nEgypt-Israel Peace Treaty, leaving autonomy for another day.\nTHE \"GOOD FAITH\" NEGOTIATIONS 41\nIn other words, once the Treaty was done, autonomy, which\nhad been a deal maker, did not become a deal breaker.\nSTUMBLE AND RECOVERY\nCarter's pledge to remain closely and personally involved\nas a full partner soon took unique form. The President could no\nlonger allow the Egyptian-Israeli relationship to consume all of\nhis time, yet he felt bound to keep both Begin and Sadat aware\nof his personal interest and commitment. So he delegated his\nrole in the negotiations not to the State Department or any other\nbureaucrat but to a \"Personal Representative.\"\nCarter's choice was Robert Strauss, a well-connected Texas\nDemocrat who had just achieved a major triumph as his\nSpecial Trade Negotiator. Strauss thus had the reputation of a\nman with presidential clout. A Foreign Service professional,\nAmbassador James Leonard, was assigned as his Deputy to\nmake sure that lines did not cross with Secretary of State\nVance. But Strauss also had important limitations, an\nunderstandable ignorance of the issues being the least of them.\nHe was a man in a hurry entering a situation where both sides\nwere newly seized by caution and restraint.\nStrauss's mandate to \"fast-track\" the negotiations was soon\nreduced to utter frustration. On the Israeli side, Begin had acted\nto make sure that autonomy did not get out of his hands. To\nreinforce both his concept that autonomy was a kind of Israeli\n\"internal\" matter and to shore up his parliamentary coalition,\nBegin arranged for a committee of cabinet officials, chaired by\nthe chairman of the National Religious Party, the veteran\npolitician Josef Burg, to conduct the negotiations. Burg, whose\nown party was badly split over retention of the territories, relied\non Begin's direct guidance. Otherwise, he could not move at\nall. And, at the working group level, as one Israeli negotiator\nput it, \"We did not have the flexibility even to nod our heads.\"\nThis extraordinary system claimed as its primary victim a\nmoving spirit of Camp David, Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan.\nDayan had reportedly been offered the chairmanship of the\nIsraeli Committee but he declined. He could not lead the\nautonomy negotiations because he concluded that Begin,\nunder pressure, did not intend autonomy to mean what he,\nDayan, wanted it to mean. Begin's six-minister committee,\n42 PALESTINIAN SEIJ-GOVERNMENT\namong whom was the obviously disgruntled Moshe Dayan,\nthus became a \"go-slow\" device par excellence.\nOn the Egyptian side, Sadat's senior civil servants had been\nhorrified at what he had wrought in the Camp David Accords.\nThey wanted to protect him (and Egypt) from what they\nregarded as dangerous exposure to the wrath of the other Arab\nstates. Meanwhile, Sadat himself expected the Americans, as\n\"full partners,\" to do the heavy lifting on autonomy and much\nelse, including the recruitment of other Arab support.\nStrauss therefore found it difficult to get the parties even to\nagree on a agenda. After the opening session in May, he\nbecame increasingly disaffected from the entire exercise. At\none point, his exasperation reportedly found a colorful\nexpression: \"It's like trying to wipe your rear with a wheel,\" he\ncomplained. \"It goes round and round and nothing happens.\"\nFinally, the \"agenda\" problem was resolved by dividing into\ntwo committees (or commissions), one on procedures for\nelections which met with rapid progress, the other on the\npowers to be granted the self-governing authority, where there\nwas no progress at all.\nStrauss's discomfiture was complete when the Carter\nAdministration resumed its search for the Holy Grail of PLO\nsupport, given untimely impetus by events in the Persian Gulf.\nAfter overthrowing the Shah in early 1979, the Ayatollah\nKhomeini had turned Iran into an aggressively anti-American\nforce that, unlike its imperial predecessor, denounced the\nCamp David Accords and enjoyed close ties to the PLO. To\nshore up Arab opposition to Iran and to diffuse the Ayatollah's\nappeal, Camp David's base of support needed broadening and\nthat included dividing the Arab Rejectionist Front, led by Iraq.1\nIt was also thought that a signal of Palestinian support would\nloosen Egypt's reluctance to negotiate on their behalf. All of\nthis led the Carter Administration to favor a new Security\nCouncil Resolution, which would reaffirm UN Security\nCouncil Resolution 242, but add some phraseology to satisfy the\nPLO's complaint that 242 was unacceptable because it\nmentioned the Palestinians only as refugees.\n'For the details of this episode see Harvey Sicherman, \"American Policy\nin the Middle East 1978-79,\" Middle East Contemporary Survey, Volume III:\n1978-79, (New York: Holmes and Meier, 1979), pp. 23-25.\nTHE \"GOOD FAITH\" NEGOTIATIONS 43\nStrauss, sent to explain how all of this would help Camp\nDavid, met outrage in Jerusalem. In Cairo, Sadat affably\nconcluded that doing this was \"stupid.\" Both Egypt and Israel\nwere now alarmed that the United States was somehow\nbacking off of the Accords to placate their enemies. To reassure\nthem, Washington abruptly reversed course, but not before the\nU.S. Ambassador to the UN, civil rights leader Andrew Young,\nviolated the pledge against negotiating directly with the PLO.\nYoung's subsequent resignation—attributed to Jewish\npressure—greatly embittered Jewish-Black relations, harming\nCarter's own Democratic Party. Suddenly, the President's\nMiddle East policies were becoming a huge domestic liability\njust as his reelection effort was getting under way.\nCompletely frustrated after six rounds of ministerial level\nmeetings, Strauss resigned to run Carter's reelection campaign.\nIn December 1979, Sol Linowitz, a Washington lawyer and\nsuccessful businessman active in both Democratic politics and\nthe Jewish community, was appointed as Carter's second\n\"Personal Representative of the President for the Middle East\nNegotiations.\" Like Strauss, Linowitz had also recently\nconducted a successful negotiation, the Panama Canal Treaties.\nThe President, however, left him with no illusions about what\nhe faced in his new assignment.\nLinowitz quickly detected that autonomy really depended\nfor its constructive impulse on the top leaders. As the\nPresident's personal representative, he adopted what he called a\n\"free wheeling\" style of dealing with those leaders \"one-on\u0002one,\" spending little time in formal negotiating sessions with\nthe cabinet level or working groups. He found Sadat \"charged\nup\" but curiously detached from his own government, whose\nsenior officials were often unaware of what he was doing. The\nEgyptian leader urged haste and believed that a decent deal for\nthe Palestinians would bring them along. \"Tell my cousin\nMenachem not to stop in the middle of the road,\" was his\nmessage to Linowitz for Begin.2\nBegin for his part was cautious, increasingly fettered to his\ncoalition and determined, through Burg and his committee, to\nkeep absolute control through every stage of negotiation. As we\nhave seen, the first victim of this approach was Foreign\n^Linowitz interview.\n44 PALESTINIAN SELF-GOVERNMENT\nMinister Moshe Dayan who resigned in October 1979, in large\npart because of differences over autonomy. Dayan later wrote\nthat Begin wanted autonomy in the framework of Israeli\nsovereignty while he, Dayan, believed \"that we had to\nestablish a pattern of relationship between us and the\nPalestinians that would preserve our vital interests, and at the\nsame time enable the Arabs to lead their lives as they wished.\"\nIn Dayan's opinion, this excluded a Palestinian state, required\nan Israeli military presence and allowed Israeli settlements\n\"confined to uncultivated state land or land bought by us from\nits Arab owners.\"3\nLinowitz did not regard Begin's approach as incompatible\nwith agreement on an interim arrangement. Begin insisted\nthat \"functional self-government\" for the Palestinians not\ntouch the spheres of security or sovereignty, but Linowitz felt\nthat this still gave considerable room for maneuver. And he\nalso found Dayan's successor, Yitzhak Shamir, who became\nForeign Minister in March 1980, to be helpful in dealing with\nBegin.\nIn early January of 1980, a Begin-Sadat meeting failed to\nmake any headway on autonomy. Sadat, still intent on speed,\nwanted to try the scheme first in Gaza, an idea that he pursued\ndespite Israeli opposition and the murder six months earlier of\na prominent Egyptian supporter there by a Syrian supported\nPalestinian terrorist group, the Popular Front for the Liberation\nof Palestine. Rather than pursue this barren line, Linowitz got\nthe Israelis and the Egyptians to present \"models\" of what they\nmeant by self-government or autonomy.4 The models were to\ndraw upon the actual workings of the Israeli Military\nGovernment.\nThe Israeli model proposed an eleven member\nAdministrative Council (including the Chairman). Its local\ndivisions were clearly \"functional,\" i.e. education, health,\nreligious, commerce, etc. Perhaps the most important feature of\nthis model was the division of powers into three categories:\nexclusive to the Self-Governing Authority (Administrative\n3\nSee Moshe Dayan, Breakthrough, (New York: Alfred Knopf, 1981), pp.\n303-304.\n•*See Appendices VI and VII for the full Israeli and Egyptian models.\nTHE \"GOOD FAITH\" NEGOTIATIONS 45\nCouncil); shared by the SGA (AC) and Israel; \"residual\" powers\nremaining with Israel. The Israeli approach assigned the SGA\n(AC) exclusive powers according to functional division.\nThe Egyptian model, like the Israeli, drew upon the actual\nworkings of the Israeli Military Government's so-called Civil\nAdministration. While admitting the distinction between\nlegislative and executive power, the Egyptians proposed that\nboth be turned over to the SGA (AC), the \"withdrawal of the\nIsraeli Military Government and its Civilian Administration\"\nbeing required by Camp David. With telling bureaucratic\nprecision, the Egyptians pointed out that the Civil\nAdministration was already a mostly Palestinian run-affair (in\n1978, there were 11,165 Palestinian employees compared to 980\nIsraelis in the West Bank; each of the Directors-General of the\nGaza administration units was a Palestinian). It was therefore\nnecessary under the new autonomy to give the Palestinians\npower to order themselves, not just to take orders from Israel as\nthey did already.\nEgypt's model made clear that Cairo was proposing a kind\nof Mandate for the development of an independent Palestine.\nThus, a purpose of the SGA was to prepare Palestinians for final\nstatus and the right to self-determination; the SGA powers\nderived from itself, i.e. an independent body; its sway\nextended over both land and inhabitants, including Arab\nJerusalem and Israeli settlements, which in the end must be\nwithdrawn. There were to be 80 to 100 freely elected members\nto the Autonomy Authority's \"Parliamentary Assembly.\"\nEgypt proposed that both the Assembly and its Executive\nCouncil (10-15 members elected from the Assembly) should be\nheadquartered in East Jerusalem and able to issue \"travel\ndocuments\" and control travel—in short, the powers of a near\u0002state. Only foreign policy and the military were excluded.\nSPRING CRISIS\nOn January 30, the occasion of the eighth ministerial\nround, Linowitz selected the Israeli framework of powers—\nsome powers exclusive to the Self-Governing Authority\n(Administrative Council); others shared by the SGA (AC) and\nIsrael; and residual powers \"remaining\" with Israel—as the\nmost creative way to pursue the talks. In his view, the\nfunctional assignment of powers would delineate the issues,\n46 PALESTINIAN SELF-GOVERNMENT\nshow agreements and reveal the most important gaps. The\nEgyptians resisted this approach because they did not care to go\nfar into details which necessitated their making \"concessions\"\nat the expense of the Arabs not present. But by the ninth round\non February 27-28, Cairo did agree. Simultaneously, the\nIsraelis also allowed that there could be an informal discussion\nof security issues, which heretofore had been off the table. New\ncommittees on economics and legal matters were added to the\nexisting bodies on elections and powers.\nThis progress, however, was soon overshadowed by events\nin the territories and elsewhere. The Carter Administration\nfound itself beset by both the Iranian hostage crisis and then,\nin December 1979, by the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Iraq's\nSaddam Hussein (leader of the Arab Rcjectionist Front) and\nthe Ayatollah's Iran had begun the quarrel that would lead to\nfull-scale war in September 1980. Camp David had attracted no\nnew takers and in Washington the Middle East overall seemed\nout of control.\nEven as the diplomats discussed autonomy, the situation in\nthe West Bank and Gaza had deteriorated. Already in\nNovember of 1979, Israeli Defense Minister Ezer Weizman had\nattempted to expel Nablus Mayor Bassam Shakaa, an outspoken\nPLO supporter, who had been elected three years earlier in\nwhat all had agreed was a fair and honest poll. Weizman's\ndecision was reversed under severe legal and political pressure\nbut the Israelis continued to accumulate evidence against\nShakaa and to prevent the mayors from meeting as a body to\ndiscuss broader political issues.\nThen, on January 31, 1980, a Yeshiva student was murdered\nin Hebron's old city center. The Begin government seized this\nopportunity to allow more Jews to settle Hebron's Jewish\nquarter, which had been almost completely destroyed and\nmany of its inhabitants massacred in the Arab revolt of 1929.\nThis was followed on March 23 by the government's decision\nto establish a Yeshiva there. Two days later, a Fierce public\nprotest in Hebron marked the opening of a general strike\nthroughout the territories.\nOn March 1, the United States voted for a unanimous UN\nSecurity Council Resolution that deplored Israel's settlement\nactivity in the territories \". . . including Jerusalem\" and called\nupon Israel to dismantle existing settlements. The Israelis were\ninfuriated and Carter disavowed the vote; then the Arabs were\nTHE \"GOOD FAITH\" NEGOTIATIONS 47\nfurious. Meanwhile, American attempts to interest Jordan and\nthe Palestinians in joining the autonomy talks had come up\nempty.\nAmidst these violent circumstances, Sadat decided he must\nbring matters to a head. Both he and Begin had agreed to\nnegotiate in good faith so that an autonomy agreement would\nbe achieved within a year, the target date being May 26, 1980.\nBut no agreement was in sight. It was, therefore, in Sadat's\nview, time for another Camp David to break the deadlock. His\nletter to Begin proposing such a summit also included these\ndemands: voting rights for East Jerusalem Arabs; legislative\nauthority for the autonomy; Israeli military movements only\nby consent of the autonomy self-government authority; and a\nfreeze on Jewish settlements. Begin turned it all down and\nCarter invited each leader instead for a separate visit.\nThese visits yielded very little. Sadat obtained from Carter a\npledge for a real Camp David if he were reelected. The U.S.\ncould agree with some of Sadat's points—elections in East\nJerusalem and a settlement freeze—but not with the notion that\nall powers should be transferred to the SGA. Begin insisted on\nfunctional administrative powers, of which he determined\nthere were 13, and the election of 13 functionaries to exercise\nthem; he rejected any foreign jurisdiction over Israeli settlers\nand restated Israel's role as \"sole judge\" of her security. He was\nagreeable, however, to a presentation of the Israeli defense\nconcept in the autonomy negotiations. Finally, all sides\nresolved to continue intensive discussions in the hopes of\ncompleting something to mark the one-year deadline they\nhad agreed upon.\nInstead, May provided a month of disasters. On May 2, five\nYeshiva students were killed and 17 wounded in an attack in\nHebron. The Israeli authorities then expelled the most ardent\npro-PLO leaders in the West Bank and Gaza. Three West Bank\nmayors were also badly maimed by settler vigilantes.\nWhile security on the ground was thus visibly\ndeteriorating, the autonomy negotiations took up \"security\nconcepts\" in the eleventh ministerial round, held in Herzlia,\nIsrael, from May 1-7. The talks were hedged with difficulties.\nIsrael refused to set up the special security committee\ndemanded by the Egyptians as a \"precondition\" for further\nnegotiations; the talks were considered \"informal\" as a\ncompromise, with security clearly on the agenda. Israel's\n48 PALESTINIAN SEIJ-GOVERNMENT\npresentation was delivered crisply by General Avraham\nTamir, who stressed Israel's intent to keep all security issues\nexclusively in its hands, including the location of its bases,\nuntil the final status of the West Bank and Gaza was\ndetermined.5 On May 5 the Egyptians presented their concept:\nthe autonomy authority must have exclusive security powers\n(police, anti-terror and even borders) in its control; there would\nbe a formal territorial borderline between the autonomous\nareas and Israel; Israeli military forces could locate themselves\nand move around only with the permission of the SGA,\npending full withdrawal after the interim period; and Israeli\nsettlements would be dismantled. Finally, early warning\nstations would not necessarily be under total Israeli control.\nThis was an astonishing and unwelcome surprise, and quite at\nvariance with the Camp David Accords. Nonetheless a\nshowdown was avoided when the Egyptian negotiators\nrecharacterized their demands as suggestions. Talks were set to\nresume on May 12.\nSadat, however, postponed any further discussions because\nthe Jerusalem issue had surfaced once more. Both the Egyptian\nand the Israeli parliaments had been busy stoking the fires of\ndiscord. Carter's reversal at the UN in March led the Egyptian\nPeople's Assembly to \"fix\" the matter by rejecting all Israeli\nchanges in Arab Jerusalem, which in their view was also part\nof the West Bank. The Knesset for its part had extended Israeli\nlaw and jurisdiction to the city (sovereignty being assumed)\nsome twelve years earlier in 1967. But for MK Geula Cohen of\nthe Likud, this was not enough, and she offered a private\nmember's bill reaffirming that decision, intended to rebut the\nUN, the U.S. and Egypt. When, on May 15, the Jerusalem Bill\nwas referred by the Knesset to Committee, i.e., taken as a\nserious bill, Egypt suspended the autonomy negotiations.\nBegin subsequently announced that he would transfer his\noffice to East Jerusalem.\n'Some account of the Israeli approach is given in Ze'ev SchifF, Security for\nPeace: Israel's Minimum Security Requirements in Negotiations with the\nPalestinians, (Washington: The Washington Institute for Near East\nPolicy, 1989), pp. 74-75. A detailed review of the autonomy negotiations at\nthis stage, drawing on Israeli sources, is given by Moshe Gammar and\nShimon Shamir in Middle East Contemporary Survey, Volume VI: 1980-\n1981, (New York: Holmes and Meier, 1981), pp. 117-124.\nTHE \"GOOD FAITH\" NEGOTIATIONS 49\nLinowitz was able to persuade Sadat that an unpassed bill\nshould not be allowed to torpedo the entire autonomy project.\nBut things did not get better. On June 13 the European\nCommunity passed a kind of peace plan that invited PLO\nparticipation. Carter tried desperately in early July to \"bridge\"\nsome of the disputes, hoping to reinvigorate the Camp David\nprocess; he failed. Then on July 30, the Knesset passed the\nJerusalem bill. Sadat promptly suspended the formal\nnegotiations, leaving Linowitz with only a \"shuttle\" at his\ndisposal.\nThe disastrous push of April and May had only\nemphasized the growing limitations constraining each of the\nCamp David parties. Carter faced a difficult renomination and\nelection fight at home; the domestic economy was sour; and\nthe administration was collecting a series of foreign policy\nreverses, in Iran, Afghanistan and Nicaragua. Sadat, ostracized\nby his fellow Arabs, disappointed by the lack of U.S. influence\nover Jordan and Saudi Arabia, also faced his own economic\nmorass that U.S. aid had yet to alleviate. Begin was physically\nailing and his fractious cabinet was barely under control.6\nThe Egyptian and American attempt to concert pressure on\nBegin had gone too far. The upshot was to confirm Begin's\ninclination to reduce the Self-Governing Authority to a\n\"clerk's\" council. Meanwhile, the situation in the territories\naggravated these political mishaps and in turn was aggravated\nby them. As it had in the past—and would in the future—the\nJerusalem issue was then exploited by the opponents of the\nentire process to make matters still worse.\nSometime in August, Sadat rediscovered the original logic\nof Camp David. The Egyptians (and also the Americans) had\noften argued that the Egyptian-Israeli peace would be affected\nby the outcome of the autonomy negotiations. But if there were\nno negotiations, there would certainly be no agreement. And\nin the absence of agreement would either Egypt or Israel refuse\nto honor the Peace Treaty? No one wanted to run the risk of\nfinding out, at least not two years before the last stage of Israeli\nwithdrawal from Sinai. And so, Sadat agreed with Linowitz\nthat there was no point in not negotiating.\n6\nIn May, Ezer Weizman, Defense Minister and architect of Likud's\nstunning election victory in 1977, resigned, bitterly accusing Begin of\nfailing in his responsibility to achieve a broader peace.\n50 PALESTINIAN SELF-GOVERNMENT\nOn October 18, 1980, Linowitz was able to convene another\nministerial meeting. Egypt deemed it preparation for a summit\nwhile Israel took it as merely another installment of the talks.\nBut both sides were determined to make the best of it.\nLinowitz had resumed his original emphasis on obtaining\nagreement over the divisions of powers. On this occasion, his\nIsraeli visitors brought him something new which appeared to\nindicate an Israeli desire for serious progress. Israel was now\nprepared to make future development of land and water subject\nto a shared power with the self-governing authority.7 This\npresumably covered land not already set aside for military\npurposes and it implied a mutual veto that could certainly affect\nIsraeli settlement plans. Linowitz did not explore the subject\nvery far. He was happy to seize upon the principle of a shared\npower, leaving its precise meaning to be negotiated by Israel\nand its Arab partner—or partners if the Palestinians ever\nshowed. The Egyptians, hewing rigidly to their previous lines,\nwere unmoved.\nA SUMMING UP\nThe Carter presidency ended with his overwhelming\ndefeat by Ronald Reagan in November of 1980. In the Middle\nEast, the Camp David partners offered glowing testimonials to\nthe President and erstwhile peacemaker. Carter's monument—\npeace between Egypt and Israel—was established although not\ndeeply rooted.\nSpecial Negotiator Linowitz had emerged from his\nexperience convinced that an autonomy negotiation was \"do\u0002able,\" and that the absence of Jordan and the Palestinians could\nbe finessed by a deal that left details for them to negotiate. He\nregarded them as \"affronted but pragmatic,\" awaiting an\nIsraeli-Egyptian deal before deciding what to do next.8 Indeed,\na survey of West Bank and Gaza civic leaders taken by one\n'Linowitz interview.

Their ideas for Palestinian self-government included\nmany of the powers the Israeli proposal would have granted\nplus of course many others that would have made the\nautonomy into a proto-state.9\nWriting to Carter on January 14, 1981, Linowitz offered a\npublic summation of what had been achieved. [See Appendix\nVIII for the report] He found agreement on election\nprocedures, but not on the participation of \"Palestinian\ninhabitants of Jerusalem\"; narrowed differences on the size\nand structure of the Self-Governing Authority (Administrative\nCouncil); and \"at least\" twenty-five (25) areas and functions for\nSGA (AC) responsibility. These corresponded to Israel's list of\npowers exclusive to the Self-Governing Authority, some of\nwhich were combined by the Israelis to make their list of 13\n(e.g. \"Industry, Commerce, Tourism\" are listed as one in the\nIsraeli Proposal and listed separately as three in the Linowitz\nreport).\nLinowitz also laid out the five major areas of disagreement:\n(1) Nature and source of powers—legislative or\nadministrative?\n(2) Water and Land rights—how would they be shared?\n(3) Jewish settlements\n(4) Security\n(5) East Jerusalem\nThe report hinted at the Israeli water and land proposals,\nnoting that on water both Egypt and Israel agreed \"that both the\ninhabitants [of the territories] and Israel share an essential\nstake in the disposition of those water resources which\nunderlie both the territories and Israel and to that end\ncoordination between them will be necessary.\" The report also\nannounced that the parties planned a Continuing Committee\n(the U.S. was invited to join and Jordan urged to participate) to\ndecide \"on the modalities of admission of persons displaced in\n1967 ... \" Quoting the joint Begin-Sadat declaration of\nDecember 13, 1980, that Camp David remained \"the only\nviable path toward comprehensive peace in the Middle East\n^Journal of Palestine Studies, Volume IX, No. 3, Spring 1980, pp. 189-91. The\nsurvey was conducted by Dr. Ann Lesch and published originally in The\nLink (November-December 1979).\n52 PALESTINIAN SELF-GOVERNMENT\ntoday,\" Linowitz concluded \"that it is in the highest interest of\nthe United States to press forward in the weeks and months\nahead in order to conclude the negotiations at the earliest\npossible date.\"\nV BAD LUCK AND BAD TIMING:\n1981-1982\nLinowitz's conclusion did not stimulate immediate action\nby the newly elected Reagan Administration. Its foreign\npolicy priorities were \"to stand tall\" and especially to halt the\nexpansion of Soviet influence. Aside from this emphasis,\nPresident Reagan himself was mainly concerned during his\nearly months in office with reviving the American spirit,\nstimulating the economy, and enlarging the defense budget,\nnot the conduct of international relations.\nAs for the Middle East, Reagan had a strong and heartfelt\ninterest in Israel, a country he characterized as a strategic ally.\nWhile some of his circle—notably Caspar Weinberger, the\nSecretary of Defense—did not share this enthusiasm, none of\nthe new President's advisors possessed the Carter team's zeal\nfor redressing Palestinian grievances. Reagan thus had no\nparticular political stake or personal interest in autonomy.\nHis first Secretary of State, Alexander M. Haig Jr., had\nconsiderable experience in the region. He had met most of the\nplayers—including Begin—during the Nixon Administration\nwhen he had been Deputy to Kissinger at the National Security\nCouncil and later Nixon's chief of staff. Also strongly\nsupportive of Israel, Haig, like the President, was primarily\nconcerned with reversing Soviet influence.\nHaig was under no illusions that the Soviet threat would\nsubmerge the Arab-Israeli conflict. He believed instead that by\nsolidifying the Egyptian-Israeli peace, and somehow adding\nSaudi Arabia's tacit support to it, the Soviets and their local\nfriends, including Syria, could be thwarted. This approach had\nreceived an important boost when Iraq invaded Iran in\n53\n54 PALESTINIAN SELF-GOVERNMENT\nSeptember 1980, neutralizing at a stroke both of the most\npowerful local antagonists to Camp David. The Saudis, for their\npart, were now much in need of American assistance and less\nsubject to Iraqi intimidation once Saddam Hussein was\nembroiled with the Ayatollah.\nHaig described what he thought he had found in the\nMiddle East as a \"consensus of strategic concern.\" By that he\nmeant that America's friends in the area, even if they would\nnot work well with each other, might be willing to work with\nthe U.S. to deal with the danger of Soviet influence. It was then\nup to the U.S. to \"coordinate\" these plans. \"Strategic consensus\"\njustified the controversial U.S. sale of Advanced Warning And\nCommunications System aircraft (AWACS) to Saudi Arabia in\n1981 and an equally controversial attempt to make Israel a\nformal \"strategic ally.\" Eventually the groundwork was laid\nfor regular military exercises, prepositioning and overbuilding\nof certain facilities, and intelligence sharing, all of which\nproved to be essential a decade later when Saddam Hussein,\nrather than the USSR, challenged U.S. interests.\nThe Palestinian problem figured only on a secondary level\nfor both Haig and Reagan. The President saw the PLO as a\nterrorist operation while Haig saw no point in soliciting Arafat,\nespecially not as a substitute for a more robust policy in the\nGulf. Nor was the new Administration much exercised over\nPalestinian grievances and claims. Early on, the President\ncalled the settlements \"not illegal.\" Professor Eugene V.\nRostow, an eminent legal scholar then serving as Director of\nthe Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, had argued that\nbecause the West Bank and Gaza were \"an unallocated part of\nthe British Mandate,\" the settlements were legal and the\nargument over them political.1 Whatever the legalities (or the\nillegalities) Reagan and Haig came to oppose the settlements as\nimpediments to the peace process, but they decided to take it up\nquietly with the Israelis.2 This was a highly unwelcome\nSee Eugene V. Rostow, \"Bricks and Stones,\" The New Republic, April 23,\n1990. For a lengthier exposition, see \"Palestinian Self-Determination:\nPossible Futures for the Unallocated Territories of the Palestine\nMandate,\" Yale Studies in World Public Order, Volume V, 1979, p. 147\nel passim.\n2\nIn October 1991, a former State Department official, David Korn,\nalleged that the illegality charge had deterred Israel's settlement drive\nBAD LUCK AND BAD TIMING 55\nchange for the Arabs who had come to expect a periodic U.S.-\nIsraeli brawl on the subject, especially at the U.N.'\nRESTARTING AUTONOMY\nAutonomy's place in all of this was, then, not a device to\nattract the PLO but rather a means of solidifying the Egyptian\u0002Israeli relationship, a key U.S. strength in the Middle East.\nHaig did not believe that Camp David could ever satisfy\nArafat's demand for independence and saw no point in trying\nto portray it as a corridor to a Palestinian state. His State\nDepartment Middle East experts, many of whom preferred a\nPalestinian state or a Jordanian-Palestinian federative solution,\nfell in with this readily enough. They strove to keep the\n\"options\" open for an alternative once autonomy failed: a\nbreakthrough in U.S.-PLO relations.4\nLinowitz's enthusiasm—he told Haig the negotiations could\nbe finished by May—was also not widely shared, if only\nbecause his final report to Carter showed that very large\ndifferences remained on most of the really critical issues.\nMoreover, the Special Negotiator's role could not be the same as\n(modestly) and that by dropping the point, the Reagan Administration\nalso ceased to oppose Israeli settlement building in a crucial period. (See\nThe New York Times, October 6, 1991). There is no evidence that American\ncharges of \"illegality\" ever prevented any Israeli settlement. Korn was\nalso unaware of the higher level U.S.-Israeli exchanges on the\nsettlements.\nAllan Gerson, The Kirkpatrick Mission: Diplomacy Without Apology,\nAmerica at the United Nations, 1981-1985, (New York: The Free Press, 1991),\npp. 57-68.\n4This was the background to the so-called Mroz affair. In August 1981,\nProfessor John Mroz, of the International Peace Academy in New York,\ninitiated an unofficial contact between State Department officials and\nPLO leader Yasser Arafat. Haig authorized the discussion with Mroz so\nlong as the 1975 U.S. promises to Israel were kept, but he has neither\nrecord nor recollection of any \"messages\" that emerged from this\nchannel. Mroz's activities (which continued until May 1982) were\napparently nurtured by higher-level State Department officials long after\nthe original authorization.

It symbolized Carter's unique presidential interest and,\nin some respects, his penchant for details, qualities that Reagan\ndid not share. Haig and the White House also fell quickly into\na public quarrel over how foreign policy was to be made and\nwho was to conduct it, especially in times of crisis. Then\nReagan was nearly assassinated in late March, and his\nwounds severely curtailed his work schedule for months.\nThese circumstances convinced Haig that continuing to\nnegotiate through a Special Negotiator directly responsible to\nthe President would be both impractical and unwise. And, in\nany event, as Haig discovered on his first visit to Cairo in April\n1981, there was another, far more important and insuperable\nbarrier to a \"fast start\" on autonomy: Sadat refused to resume\nany discussions on the subject until after the Israeli election\nthen scheduled for June 1981. Like many in Washington,\nSadat was hoping that Begin would be defeated by his Labour\nrival, Shimon Peres.\nThe American visitors found Sadat strangely detached\nfrom Egypt's extremely serious economic problems (there had\nbeen rioting in January 1981 when Cairo attempted to carry out\nan IMF reform program) and totally disdainful of his critics\nboth abroad and at home. Sadat told Haig he had gone to\nJerusalem because he feared American naivete about the Soviets\nwould jeopardize everything he had sought in the peace\nprocess. He readily agreed with Haig's anti-Soviet strategy of\nstrategic consensus and saw a major role for Egypt in it. If\nanything, Sadat outdid the Americans in denouncing the\nSoviets: he saw Moscow making a three pronged attempt\nthrough its Iraqi ally, through proxies in Yemen, Ethiopia and\nLibya, and through support for Syria, to isolate and overthrow\nhim. But Sadat also expressed his disappointment with\nAmerica's failure to \"produce\" more Arab support for Camp\nDavid or to finish the autonomy negotiations.5\nIn Israel that April, Haig found the opposite approach to\nautonomy. Ariel Sharon had suddenly surfaced as a proponent\nof rapid progress, arguing that the talks could be settled in a few\nmonths if only the U.S. would \"force\" Egypt to resume\nnegotiations in good faith. Beneath the surface could be\ndetected Israel's desire to settle all outstanding issues with\n5Hai\naig interview.\nBAD LUCK AND BAD TIMING 57\nEgypt before her remaining forces were withdrawn on\nschedule from Sinai in April of 1982.\nWith American encouragement, Begin and Sadat met on\nJune 4, 1981, at Gezira in Southern Sinai. But three days later,\non June 7, Israel bombed Iraq's nascent nuclear program at\nOsirak, greatly embarrassing the Egyptians and earning\nwidespread condemnation abroad, which included a hostile\nUN resolution and a slowdown in the supply of U.S. war\nplanes to Israel by Secretary of Defense Weinberger. Despite\npre-election public opinion polls showing a Peres lead, Begin's\nLikud emerged as the largest Israeli party once more when the\nvotes were tallied on June 30, 1981.\nBegin's second government contained a different and far\nmore difficult array of personalities for the United States.\nDayan and Weizman were gone. The new Foreign Minister\nYitzhak Shamir had opposed the Camp David Accords. The\nnew Defense Minister Ariel Sharon had disturbed the earlier\npeace negotiations with theatrical bulldozing of new settlement\nsites in Sinai. As the official now in charge of the West Bank\nand Gaza, Sharon argued that Palestinian aspirations to\nstatehood could be satisfied in Jordan, which he claimed was\nalready a Palestinian state. He was prepared to take forceful\naction against the local leadership, much as he had done in\nputting down a rebellion in Gaza ten years earlier. And he\nproposed a much broader settlement plan, which would place\nJewish settlements not only on the possible invasion routes\nfrom the south and east but also between major Arab population\ncenters, foreclosing the possibility of a contiguous Palestinian\npolity even in the West Bank.\nIn early August of 1981, Sadat visited Washington to bask in\nthe new administration's support. During Sadat's visit, Saudi\nArabia's Crown Prince Fahd unexpectedly launched an\nalternative to Camp David.6 Couched as an \"international\nconsensus,\" the Prince's remarks suggested a return to the\nArab version of 242. Fahd's plan also contained a transition\nperiod for the West Bank, this time under UN supervision. The\n\"Fahd Plan\" was an unusual Saudi bid for a new Arab\nrapprochement; Sadat did not dismiss it, although he\n^Text can be found in Middle East Contemporary Survey, Volume V: 1980-81,\n(New York: Holmes and Meier, 1981), pp. 163-65.\n58 PALESTINIAN SELF-GOVERNMENT\nwondered aloud how the Saudis could advance it in the\nabsence of any negotiations with Israel. Some in the Reagan\nAdministration expressed considerable interest in the plan.\nSoon thereafter on August 25-26, 1981, Sadat and Begin met\nin Alexandria to reaffirm their partnership on the basis of\nCamp David. By all accounts, it was the best meeting they ever\nexperienced. Both sides liked the American consensus idea.\nBoth also resolved to reinforce their relationship by speeding\nup \"normalization\" and finishing the autonomy negotiations\nno later than year's end, well ahead of the final Sinai\nwithdrawal scheduled for April 26, 1982. Informed of this\nsurprising and welcome development, Haig instructed that his\ncalendar be cleared for a three- to six-week \"shuttle\" in\nNovember-December, 1981.\nThe Alexandria Summit cleared the way for the\nresumption, on September 23-24, of the official autonomy\nnegotiations in Giza, a Cairo suburb. Nearly a year had passed\nsince the issues had been encountered. There being no Special\nNegotiator, the American Ambassadors to Egypt and Israel,\nAlfred Atherton and Samuel Lewis, co-chaired the U.S.\ndelegation at what turned out to be a productive meeting.\nFurther sessions were scheduled for October and both sides\nagreed to pursue \"principles\" of autonomy rather than the\nprecise detail Israel had previously demanded and the\nEgyptians detested. This promised much faster movement.\nSADAT'S MURDER: CAMP DAVID UNDER SIEGE\nThe entire edifice of the peace process was badly shaken,\nhowever, when on October 6, 1981, Sadat was murdered by\nEgyptian soldiers belonging to a radical Muslim group while\nreviewing a parade commemorating the Yom Kippur War.\nThe Camp David Accords were now put to the test. Would\nEgypt and Israel hold to their commitment? And would\nWashington hold to Camp David?\nHaig had been working to put in place the final prerequisite\nof an Israeli withdrawal—a multinational force for Sinai as\nrequired by the Treaty. He was now confronted by European\nand Saudi attempts to supercede Camp David in favor of either\nthe European Community's international conference\n(including the PLO) or the Fahd Plan. A savage argument\nerupted behind the scenes, especially with the British, over\nBAD LUCK AND BAD TIMING 59\nwhether the Europeans would join the multinational force\nwithout attaching political conditions that would invoke the EC\nscheme. Haig argued strongly that in the absence of\nunconditional European participation, the entire Egyptian\u0002Israeli Peace Treaty could be in jeopardy. Israel would simply\nnot leave Sinai if Camp David was to be denied. After he\narranged direct appeals from Reagan to British Prime Minister\nMargaret Thatcher and French President Francois Mitterand,\nboth agreed on November 22, 1981 to join the Force under the\nCamp David Framework—overruling their foreign ministries.\nThe Peace Treaty had been saved.\nThe new Egyptian President, Hosni Mubarak, had been\nSadat's vice president, and he insisted that Sadat's policy would\ncontinue. But he made several swift adjustments. He released\nmost of the opposition politicians Sadat had arrested shortly\nbefore his assassination and severely repressed Islamic\nfundamentalist cells throughout Egypt. Mubarak also agreed to\ncontinue the autonomy negotiations but, as soon became\nevident, without giving his negotiators a mandate to\ncompromise.\nThe autonomy working team met in Tel Aviv from October\n23-29 and then, on November 4-12, a ministerial round was\nheld at Giza. In between, Egyptian Foreign Minister Kamal\nHassan Ali visited Begin and reaffirmed the importance of the\nCamp David Accords, although they made no particular\nprogress on autonomy except to emphasize the election\nmodalities. In the course of the ministerial sessions the Israelis\nsuggested that the future development of land and water be a\nshared power. While this was not new, Linowitz having heard\nit the year before, it was regarded as highly significant by the\nU.S. team, given the Begin government's composition and\nSharon's role as Defense Minister in charge of the territories.'\n'Official Israeli autonomy proposals as published [See Appendix IX] do\nnot contain this position. Some hint of them is given in public\ncomments at the time by Yitzhak Shamir and for the opposition, Yitzhak\nRabin. See also Ruth Lapidoth, \"The Camp David Process and the New\nU.S. Plan for the Middle East: A Legal Analysis,\" USC Cites, Fall-Winter\n1982-83, p. 24. Various U.S. participants in the autonomy negotiations,\nincluding Former Secretary of State Haig, confirm that Israel did put\nfuture land and water development as a shared power \"on the table\" in\nlate 1981-early 1982. One diplomat attached to the U.S. embassy at the\ntime, however, suggested that Begin in particular was most anxious to\n60 PALESTINIAN SELF-GOVERNMENT\nThe Americans found, however, that the Egyptians were\noddly unreceptive to this manifestation of Israel's willingness\nto share some important powers with the Palestinians. The\nministerial meeting was rather taken up mostly with Israel's\ninsistence that Egypt reaffirm once more its devotion to the\nAccords as the \"sole framework\" for progress, a point clearly\nintended to prevent any Egyptian dallying with the Fahd Plan\nor the Europeans. Convinced from the Egyptian stance in the\ntalks that Mubarak wanted no further exposure on the\nPalestinian issue, the Israelis concluded by November 15 that\nan autonomy agreement could not be concluded any time\nsoon.8\nOn December 14th, Begin's unexpected application of\nIsraeli law and jurisdiction to the Golan Heights (regarded by\nother countries as virtual annexation) distracted all attention\nfrom the talks. Many members of the U.S. team had already\nconcluded that Washington's interest lay elsewhere and that\nautonomy was an orphan. This was only partly true. Having\nsustained Camp David despite Sadat's murder and these other\ndisasters, Haig—along with Begin and Mubarak—still had a\nprofound reason to focus on autonomy: if the negotiations were\nallowed to wither, the impending final Israeli withdrawal\nfrom Sinai might be upset.\nHaig's first foreign trip in January 1982 took him to Europe,\nwhere he rallied opposition to the Communist imposition of\nmartial law against the Solidarity Union in Poland. Upon\nFinish the negotiations and took positions \"ahead of his party—testing\nthe waters before going public. See FBIS January 22, 1982 for Rabin's\nJanuary 13th description of Sharon's water-land proposal as \"flexible\"\nand \"acceptable\" to Labour. In a lengthy interview on January 28, 1982\n(Foreign Broadcast Information Service [FBIS] January 29, 1982) Shamir\ndescribed the Israeli proposal on land as having received \"many\ncompliments\" from the U.S. because, in Shamir's view, it offered \"great\nconsideration\" for the Arab inhabitants. The Hebrew newspaper Ma'ariv\npublished a version of the full Israeli plan which, like all public Israeli\nplans, did not refer specifically to water or land as a shared power but\nassigned powers to the Self-Governing Authority while referring vaguely\nto activities that require \"cooperation\" and \"coordination.\"\n°See Moshe Gammer, \"Egyptian-Israeli Relations,\" Middle East\nContemporary Survey, Volume VI: 1981-82, p.162.\nBAD LUCK AND BAD TIMING 61\nreaching Cairo on January 12, Haig found that his plan to press\nthe autonomy talks to a rapid conclusion was subtly opposed by\nthe Egyptians, who had resumed their most rigid positions that\nautonomy was the prelude to Palestinian sovereignty. In\nJerusalem a day later, the focus was different. The Israelis\nwere nervous about both Sinai and Lebanon. Begin and Sharon\nwere full of warnings about Egyptian behavior and the risks of\nwar with the PLO and Syria. The Secretary of State was\nnonetheless able to discuss the ramifications of the \"shared\nland development\" proposal, probing whether this would cover\nmilitary areas that would come free once Israeli forces had\nbeen withdrawn to select sites as required by Camp David.9 But\nboth Burg and Begin gave him to understand that an\nautonomy agreement was not really within reach.10\nTHE THIRD SPECIAL NEGOTIATOR\nReturning to Washington, Haig faced a serious dilemma.\nWhere before, Egypt and the U.S. suggested that lack of\nagreement on autonomy might hamper the Peace Treaty\nwhile Israel resisted, more recently Israel had been arguing\nthat autonomy should be settled lest it complicate withdrawal\nfrom Sinai.\nSadat's murder, the difficulties over the multinational force\nin Sinai and the danger of war in Lebanon stoked fears that all\ncould yet be lost if the withdrawal was not carried out. A crisis\n^Haig interview. U.S. working-level morale at this juncture was not very\nhigh, something that Haig himself noticed. One member of the team\nrecalled a stupefying discussion over whether the Self-Governing\nAuthority (Administrative Council) could issue postage stamps—perhaps\na sign of sovereignty. Haig himself had a taste of what could happen\nwhen he and Begin had a go-around on the size of the autonomy\ncouncil. When Haig suggested that 20 or 30 was a good compromise\n(versus Egypt's proposed 80-100) and corresponding to Linowitz's 25\npowers, Begin demurred. He had learned that a certain European state\nhad a parliament of that size; thirteen was therefore a better number,\ncorresponding to the functional activities of the SGA (AC) as defined in\nthe latest Israeli proposal. Despite such incidents, both the Israeli and\nthe U.S. teams did make important progress in narrowing differences\nover the difficult 1981-82 period.\ng interview.\n62 PALESTINIAN SELF-GOVERNMENT\nover autonomy had to be avoided, yet agreement was nowhere\nin sight. Egypt would take no further risks. And Begin and\nSharon had come to believe that even after the Sinai\nwithdrawal, autonomy could not be workable so long as the\nPLO continued to thrive as both a diplomatic force and as a\ngrowing military problem on Israel's northern border. Haig\nhad therefore to extricate the U.S. and its partners from further\nfrictions on autonomy without collapsing the negotiations\naltogether.\nReturning to Cairo and Jerusalem on January 27-29, the\nSecretary of State worked on convincing Israel to accept\nEuropean troops in the Sinai Multinational Force despite a final\nflurry of inflammatory statements from various European\nforeign ministries. He also began work on the absurd Taba\ndispute which was to curse Egyptian-Israeli relations for years\nthereafter.11 Finally, Haig introduced Richard Fairbanks, a\nwell-connected Republican lawyer then serving as State\nDepartment Counsellor, who was to become the third Special\nNegotiator. This was Haig's solution to the immediate\nautonomy dilemma. Fairbanks' task was to keep the talks alive\nbut free of friction and to sort them out for a later Haig effort\nonce Sinai withdrawal had taken place. His was a novel and\nquite different role than had been played by Strauss and\nLinowitz.\nFairbanks, like Linowitz, soon came to believe that\nautonomy made sense, was \"doable\" and could be done fairly\nquickly if the parties could be made to focus on it. He also\nthought that the Palestinians had a lot to gain from it all, a\nprospect of which they were ignorant because of lack of\naccurate information and false hopes of rescue by the PLO or\nthe international community. Sharon inadvertently aided\nFairbank's cause. As part of an attempt to undermine the PLO\nwas a tiny strip of land astride the new Israel-Egyptian border\nand the site of an Israeli-owned resort hotel. The Israelis argued that the\nreal demarcation line differed from official maps based on the 1914\nBritish survey; the Egyptians cited the survey line and insisted that there\ncould not be an adjustment to this border, the Israeli commercial\ninterest notwithstanding. National pride thus engaged, years passed\nuntil the third party arbitration procedure was invoked, as provided\nunder the Peace Treaty. Egypt was awarded the strip and a bitter\naftertaste was left in all mouths.\nBAD LUCK AND BAD TIMING 63\nthroughout the territories, Sharon took up \"Village Leagues\" as\nan alternative to the PLO-dominated city leadership, putting\nimportant patronage in the hands of rural Palestinians\nsometimes resentful of their urban brothers. This directly\nthreatened the urban political class, including the PLO's base of\nsupport, to whom autonomy began to look like a way to\nfrustrate Sharon's plans.\nAs was so often the case in this doleful history, procedure\nsoon came to obstruct all else, provoked by the perennial\nquarrel over Jerusalem. Following the Sinai withdrawal,\nMubarak was expected to visit Israel and thereby renew the\n\"normalization\" of the peace, so important a feature of the\noriginal Camp David bargain. But he refused to come if it\nmeant a visit to Jerusalem. In the ensuing uproar, Begin\ndeclared that the next round of the autonomy negotiations\nshould be held in Israel's capital. Egypt refused. Not a month\nafter his first official visit to the area as a Special Negotiator\n(February 18-21), Fairbanks could only shuttle about while\ntempers cooled and some face-saving formula was devised.\nOn May 26, Haig delivered a speech on the Middle East that\nemphasized the need for diplomatic movement on three fronts:\nLebanon, autonomy and the Iran-Iraq war. Although unable to\ninterest the White House in any concrete initiatives, he was\nstill persuaded that if the parties could only keep to the Camp\nDavid concept of autonomy as an interim agreement intended\nto improve Israeli-Palestinian relations, then at least that could\nbe done. Fairbanks, through the diplomatic device of \"non\u0002papers\" (unofficial statements of positions on the basis of\ninformal discussions) had established the main areas of\nagreement and disagreement, areas closely resembling those\nof the late Linowitz period. He and Haig had planned\ntentatively for a Camp David-style meeting at the ministerial\nlevel for the eastern shore of Maryland sometime in June.\nVarious \"bridging proposals\" had been developed at the\nworking level that Fairbanks believed might offer ground for\ncompromise, although they had not been discussed in detail\nwith Haig.\nThe American working group was actually preparing to go\nfrom Israel to Egypt for another round of \"non-papering\" when\nthe Lebanon War broke out. Haig was in Europe with President\nReagan for the Versailles Summit of the leading industrial\ndemocracies. Summoned at 7:30 a.m. on June 6, to the State\n64 PALESTINIAN SELF-GOVERNMENT\nDepartment \"situation room,\" Fairbanks ordered the group\nwithdrawn.\nHaig had only one more scene to play on autonomy before\nhis embittered relations with the Reagan team on the Lebanon\nWar compelled his resignation. On June 20-22, Prime Minister\nBegin visited Washington. He was treated to criticism by the\nPresident but emerged more determined than ever to stay the\ncourse even though contrary to his original plan (and to the\nIsraeli Cabinet's decisions) Ariel Sharon's Operation \"Peace for\nGalilee\" now involved the siege of Beirut and war with Syria.12\nAt a final meeting in Washington, Haig listened to Begin's\nexplanation of how the destruction of the PLO in Lebanon\nwould facilitate autonomy for the Palestinians in the territories.\nHaig then argued that if this was so, Israel could afford a more\nexpansive version of powers for the autonomy once the PLO\nthreat was removed. Promising to help hold the line for Israel\nin Washington, the Secretary of State suggested that after the\nwar Begin should agree to U.S. bridging positions on some of\nthe more contentious autonomy problems; he also argued\nstrenuously for a settlements freeze to facilitate the\nnegotiations, as Begin had done earlier following Camp David.\nBegin did not reject Haig's points but he did not accept them\neither.13\nHaig had hoped that Israel, working with the U.S., could\ntake the diplomatic offensive and secure a political victory\ncommensurate with its military triumph, i.e., an autonomy\nagreement following the defeat of Syria and the PLO, and the\nfreeing of Lebanon. But none of this was to be. On June 25,\n1982, Haig resigned under pressure from the White House.\nVery soon thereafter the United States sharply opposed Israel's\npurposes in Lebanon. And on August 16, 1982, at the height of\nthe siege of Beirut, Egypt announced its suspension of the\nautonomy negotiations pending Israeli withdrawal from\nLebanon and a \"new concept\" for the discussions. True to\nform, the Egyptian-Israeli Peace Treaty survived Lebanon, but\nZe'ev Schiff and Ehud Yaari, Israel's Lebanon War, (New York:\nSimon and Schuster, 1984), p. 181 el passim.\ninterview.\nBAD LUCK AND BAD TIMING 65\nautonomy did not. [See Appendix IX for Israel's Final\nAutonomy Proposal]\nTHE REAGAN PLAN AND AUTONOMY\nHaig had believed that the Israeli military action in\nLebanon, although going far beyond its originally announced\nobjective, could yield beneficial strategic results: A\nhumiliating defeat for the PLO and the Syrians would\nseriously damage Soviet interests, Lebanon might be given a\nchance to recover independence, and last but not least, the\nArab Rejectionist Front opposed to Camp David would be\ncrippled.\nAll of this depended, however, on a swift Israeli victory and\nan equally swift removal of all foreign forces, Israeli, PLO and\nSyrian, from Lebanon. But Sharon's strategy suffered from\nflaws of both design and execution. His Christian allies failed\nto take Beirut for him, leaving Israel to besiege the city and the\nPLO. Nor were the Syrians driven out, although their severe air\nlosses and inadequate air defenses forced them into an early\ncease-fire. Haig had then attempted to use the threat of further\nIsraeli military action to leverage agreements removing all\nforeign forces and, with that accomplished, to deploy a\nmultinational force to stabilize Beirut, pending the\nestablishment of a new Lebanese government.\nIt did not work out that way. The new Secretary of State,\nGeorge Shultz, began by taking up the Palestinian issue; a U.S.\nled multinational force was deployed to allow the PLO a\ngraceful exit; and the Syrians, anxious to be rearmed by the\nSoviets, were not put under political pressure to agree to\nanything until nearly mid-winter when new, more advanced\nSoviet missiles were in place. By May of 1983, when the\nstillborn Israel-Lebanon Peace Treaty was brokered personally\nby Shultz, it was already clear that the Rejectionists—\nespecially Assad of Syria—were stronger than before.\nThis is not the place to recount the full Lebanon tragedy.\nSuffice it to say that the Reagan Administration was anxious to\ncollect the strategic benefits of Syrian and PLO defeat while\nsimultaneously distancing the United States from an Israeli\ngovernment it considered dangerously out of control. Once the\nPLO had been escorted out of Beirut the time was considered\nripe for a \"U.S. plan\" to resolve the unending drama of the\n66 PALESTINIAN SELF-GOVERNMENT\nPalestinians. Its purpose would be to expand the circle of the\npeacemakers with an overt appeal to the King of Jordan who\ncould now operate relatively free of Syrian and PLO\nconstraint—or so it was thought. Simultaneously, neither the\nState Department nor the White House wanted to abandon\nCamp David, which remained a restraint on Begin. Special\nefforts were therefore made to couch the American plan in\nterms of Camp David and especially in the context of the\nsuspended autonomy negotiations.\nAlready on August 30, King Hussein, speaking in London,\nhad hinted broadly at a forthcoming American initiative,\nadding what should have disturbed American officialdom but\ndid not: any new U.S. proposals should present a clear break\nwith Camp David. He had been thoroughly consulted by\nAssistant Secretary of State Nicholas Veliotes, a former U.S.\nambassador to Jordan. Begin was not consulted on the\ninitiative. In fact, Reagan's speech was hurriedly put together\nfor fear that a leak would provoke a premature Israeli reaction.\nU.S. Ambassador to Israel Samuel Lewis described the results\nin these terms:\nThe Reagan initiative on September 1 was a genuine\neffort to recreate momentum, to relaunch the Camp David\nagreement, with some embellishments, but\nfundamentally on the same terms. The timing was, in\nmy judgment, abysmal, the tactics of its presentation\nworse, the outcome so far, nil.\nLewis, in fact, had been compelled to present the ideas of the\nReagan plan in a letter to a surprised Prime Minister Begin the\nday Reagan delivered his speech. Even worse, Lewis had been\ninstructed to read the accompanying explanations or \"talking\npoints,\" without change [See Appendix X]. These were clearly\nwritten for Arab rather than Israeli ears, Washington's idea\nbeing to treat everyone to the identical message as an act of\ngood faith.\n^Unofficial transcript of Ambassador Lewis' speech at the Dayan Center,\nTel Aviv University, October 30, 1984, provided to the author by the\nAmbassador, who noted that Israeli press reports of his remarks—\ntypically billed as \"off the record\"—got him into some ill-repute with\nthe Reagan White House.\nBAD LUCK AND BAD TIMING 67\nBegin's vacation—for him a unique occasion—was\ninterrupted to receive the Ambassador's urgent message.\nWhile quite aware of anger against him in Washington, the\nIsraeli leader had believed that the ending of the Lebanon War\nstill left U.S. interests well ahead of where they had been\nbefore the Israeli invasion. He was in for a rude surprise.\nThe proposals themselves [See Appendix XI] reaffirmed\nCamp David and took the form of a commentary on \"the\npositions we [the U.S.] will adopt in negotiations.\" As far as\n\"transitional measures\" this meant: (1) full autonomy meant\n\"real authority\" for the Palestinian inhabitants \"over\nthemselves, the land and its resources, subject to fair\nsafeguards on water\"; (2) new emphasis on the ties between\nthe territories and Jordan; (3) East Jerusalem participation in\nthe elections; (4) a real settlements freeze; and (5) most\nsuggestive of all, \"progressive Palestinian responsibility for\ninternal security based on capability and performance.\" Some\nof the sting of these provisions for Israel was blunted by\ndeclarations that the U.S. would \"oppose\" threats to Israel's\nsecurity (\"reasonably defined\"); isolation of the territories\nfrom Israel; and \"sovereign rights\" for either side during\ntransition. External security had to remain in Israeli hands.\nThe U.S. also stood against dismantling the existing\nsettlements.\nHaving thus put the United States behind several of what\nhad been the Fairbanks' bridging proposals, the U.S. paper then\nlaid out positions on issues of final status. These were\nrestatements of Washington's traditional position on 242,\n(\"land for peace\") although relieved by the President's public\ncomment that Israel would never have to return to the\nvulnerable borders of 1967. It put the U.S. on record against\neither Israeli sovereignty or a Palestinian state for the West\nBank and Gaza: \"The preference we will pursue in the final\nstatus negotiations is association of the West Bank and Gaza\nwith Jordan.\" While opposing once more the code words \"self\u0002determination\" because they meant a Palestinian state, the U.S.\ntook the Camp David language a step forward: \"We believe that\nthe Palestinians must take the leading role in determining\ntheir own future\" versus the Camp David language of \"the\nPalestinians will participate in the determination of their own\nfuture.\" Jerusalem would remain subject to negotiations. The\n68 PALESTINIAN SELF-GOVERNMENT\ntalking points stated that Washington would not support Israeli\nsettlement as \"extraterritorial outposts.\"15\nFinally, Begin was informed that the King of Jordan\nunderstood the U.S. position that Camp David must remain the\nbasis for negotiations, and that the U.S. would support these\npositions even if there were no takers. If there were, however,\n\"the U.S. would take immediate steps to relaunch the\nautonomy negotiations with the broadest possible participation\nas envisaged under the Camp David Agreements.\"\nIsrael was seriously divided over the Reagan proposals. On\nSeptember 4, the Begin government accused the U.S. of sharp\n\"deviations\" from Camp David and refused to negotiate the\nnew proposals, while Shimon Peres announced for Labour that\nthe U.S. positions were a basis for \"serious dialogue.\" At first,\nWashington treated Begin's refusal to be itself a negotiating\nposition, underestimating both Begin's outrage and his\nconviction that Camp David had indeed been abandoned. In\nthe view of one Israeli analyst the U.S. positions \"could shake\nthe very compromise\" on which Camp David was based—\navoiding any prescription of final status in order to achieve a\nworkable transition agreement that would improve relations\namong the parties.16\nThe immediate difficulty—the fatal difficulty—with the\nReagan plan was its failure to produce the most effective form\nof pressure on Begin: an Arab party ready to negotiate. On\nSeptember 9, five days after Israel rejected the plan, the Arab\nSummit at Fez reiterated long held positions incompatible with\nthe American stand. By linking Lebanon and the West Bank,\nthe U.S. had also given both Israel and Syria perverse\nincentives to stall over Lebanese withdrawal. Soon the U.S. was\n15Eight days after Reagan's speech and talking points, Secretary Shultz\ntold the House Foreign Affairs committee that the U.S. position on\nsettlements did not mean a denial of Jewish rights to live in the\nterritories. See Statement of Secretary of State to U.S. House of\nRepresentatives Committee on Foreign Affairs, September 9, 1982, p. 8.\n16See Lapidoth, op. at., p. 26. The Reagan proposals occasioned a battle of\nthe commentaries. Alan J. Kreczko, Legal Advisor to Strauss and\nLinowitz, defended the initiative as consonant with the Camp David\nAccords, while Ruth Lapidoth, Legal Advisor to the Israeli negotiatiors,\nargued otherwise. See Alan J. Kreczko, \"Support Reagan's Initiative,\"\nForeign Policy, Winter 1982-83 and Ruth Lapidoth, op. cit.\nBAD LUCK AND BAD TIMING 69\nembroiled in drawn out negotiations with King Hussein, who\nin order to proceed needed a settlement freeze, PLO assent and\nlater, as Syrian power revived, an international conference.\n(His negotiations with Arafat also fell victim to Syrian and\nIraqi influence.) By the spring of 1983, Shultz was engaged\ninstead in brokering the still-born Israel-Lebanon Peace Treaty\nand Special Negotiator Fairbanks had become a Special\nAmbassador to the Lebanese inter-party talks aimed at\nreconstituting the Lebanese Government.\nSUMMING IT UP\nThroughout the 1981-82 period the autonomy negotiations\nexhibited characteristics familiar to its earlier stages. Egyptian,\nAmerican and Israeli positions reflected widely different\nconcepts of autonomy; the peace treaty with Egypt retained its\nprimacy; Jordanians and the Palestinians were still absent; and\nthe press of other events in the area overtook the negotiations.\nHalf a year had elapsed before a re-elected Menachem Begin,\nAnwar Sadat and the Reagan Administration could resume\nthe work of Camp David where Jimmy Carter and Sol Linowitz\nleft off. Begin and Sadat were not the same men they had been\nthe year before; each was politically restricted and focused on\nother matters. The American official most committed to the\nCamp David Accords, Secretary of State Haig, was an\nincreasingly isolated figure in an Administration not very\nenthusiastic about the Accords and not especially interested.\nThen there was plain bad luck. Just when Begin and Sadat\nhad resolved to finish the matter, Sadat was murdered. Haig's\nintention to press for agreement was diverted by a shared\nEgyptian and Israeli desire not to see the final withdrawal\nfrom Sinai burdened by an autonomy crisis. The position of\nSpecial Negotiator was revived to keep autonomy at least in\nmotion if not in movement until a better moment. That\nmoment may have come in the summer of 1982 but then the\nLebanese War transformed the situation once more.\nPalestinian and Jordanian objections to autonomy were\nbased largely on the Palestinian demand for an independent\nstate and Jordan's interest in the swift resumption of sovereign\ncontrol over most, if not all, the territory lost in 1967. Both were\nheavily influenced by Syrian objections to a peace process that\nheld little appeal for Damascus, by Saudi reticence and by Iraqi\n70 PALESTINIAN SELF-GOVERNMENT\nintimidation. Strategically, the Iran-Iraq war and Israel's defeat\nof both the PLO and Syria in Lebanon incapacitated the\nrejectionist front of Arabs opposed to Camp David. But the\nIsraeli victory was flawed; both the PLO and Syria were able to\nrecover, partly with Soviet help. Through the Reagan plan\nAmerica attempted to distance itself from Israel, still endorse\nCamp David and somehow attract the Jordanians to\nnegotiations that would begin with autonomy. This proved\nboth tactically and strategically inept and indeed replicated the\nearlier Carter experience, when the White House attempted to\n\"sell\" autonomy to the PLO and the other Arabs as a corridor to\nArab sovereignty.\nEssentially, the parties to the negotiations were able to agree\non free elections, and on a Self-Governing Authority with a\nsignificant list of exclusive powers.17 Conceivably there could\nhave been some important shared powers if the Israeli proposal\nfor development of future land and water had been taken up. A\ncompromise on the size of the authority seemed within reach\n(more than Israel's 13 but less than Egypt's 80) and some other\nissues may have been amenable to American bridging\nproposals if they had been offered in a better negotiating\ncontext than the free-standing Reagan initiative. The five\nmajor areas of disagreement left at the end of the Linowitz\nperiod were still there in 1982, and the final American \"stab\"\nat a plan made in Washington simply aggravated the\ndifferences.\nThe negotiating record, however, does hold important\nimplications for the future. These four points emerge clearly:\n(1) Interim Agreements Are Not the Last Word: Attempts to\n\"guarantee\" the end game through an interim agreement will\nmake even the interim step impossible. Self-Government\n(Autonomy) does not assure Palestinian national\nindependence nor does it guarantee eventual Israeli\nsovereignty over the territory.\n(2) The \"Last Word\" Will Still Intrude: there are long-term\nconsequences flowing from different negotiating positions; the\nfear of those consequences will intrude even as interim steps\nare discussed.\n''Reportedly, the working groups spent much time debating whether\nIsrael's insistence that some of the autonomy's powers be subject to a\nnegotiated \"coordination and cooperation\" with Israel seriously depleted\nreal Palestinian authority. [See Appendix IX under POWERS, point 2]\nBAD LUCK AND BAD TIMING 71\n(3) Outside Help Will Be Needed: Given the risks to be run by\nboth Arabs and Israelis on issues such as security, land, water,\nsettlements, and Jerusalem, outside help in reducing these\nrisks and overcoming the obstacles will be necessary. The U.S.\nremains best suited to play the role of mediator but other\ninternational support will also be needed both within the\nregime and out of it.\n(4) The Deal Must Work on Its Own Terms: A larger peace\nprocess involving state-to-state negotiations can encourage an\nautonomy agreement but cannot be a substitute for an Israeli\u0002Palestinian deal that works for both sides. Similarly, autonomy\ncan facilitate state-to-state peace diplomacy (as it did for Egypt\nand Israel) but only if those states have independently decided\nto seek peace on sound bilateral foundations.\n\nVI FROM AUTONOMY TO\nSELF-GOVERNMENT\nFollowing the failure of the Reagan Plan, autonomy was\nrelegated to the archives until early 1988. For nearly five years\na deadly stalemate prevailed in Middle East diplomacy. Badly\nbruised by its Lebanon experience, the Reagan Administration\nreduced its exposure to the Arab-Israeli conflict. Secretary\nShultz, his faith in the Arabs shaken by Syrian and Saudi\nbehavior in 1982-83, found better working relations with an\nIsraeli government free of both Begin and Sharon—both\ncasualties of the Lebanon disaster.\nThe Israeli National Unity Government of 1984-88 was\nformed to extricate Israel from Lebanon and to reform an\neconomy nearly out of control. Peres and Shamir agreed to\nrotate the prime minister's post, each to serve two years, while\nthe Defense Ministry was assigned to Rabin. The U.S.,\nworking with Prime Minister Peres, again tried to lure Jordan\ninto a peace process in which autonomy would play a\ndistinctly lesser role [See Appendix XII for the so-called Peres\u0002Hussein Agreement]. These efforts were still-born and with\nYitzhak Shamir's assumption of leadership, they ceased\naltogether.1 Egypt continued to observe a \"cold peace\" with\nIsrael and had lost interest in Palestinian autonomy.\nfor naught were the attempts by the U.S., Jordan and Israel to\nstimulate economic development in the territories with international\nsupport. (These included the American \"quality of life\" program, the\nJordanian Development Plan and Israel's call for resettlement of\nrefugees, especially in Gaza.)\n73\n74 PALESTINIAN SELF-GOVERNMENT\nIt was rather the Palestinians themselves who inadvertently\nrevived the entire subject. As noted earlier, the diplomatic\ndiscussions on a Self-Governing Authority had never found a\nPalestinian interlocutor. But over the five years following the\nReagan Plan the territories had not been still. Already in the\nearly 1980s, the Israeli Military Government had had to\nassume the duties of the dismissed mayors while Sharon's\nbrief experiment with the Village Leagues had further\nfractured the lines of administration. Especially following\n1983, there had been a large influx of Israeli settlers, drawn less\nby ideology than by better living conditions—bedroom suburbs\nrather than pioneering settlements became the norm across\nthe Green Line. Finally, the Palestinians themselves felt a\nsteady encroachment of the Israeli bureaucracy, economy and\nsociety on their own lives. Dayan's strictures \"to leave them\nalone\" had been left behind.\nAlready in the summer of 1987, American officials had\nwarned Israel that the territories were near-filled with\nexplosive discontent. Following Israel's losses in Lebanon, the\nPalestinians seemed more assertive. Then in December of 1987\na traffic accident in Gaza touched off what became known as\nthe intifadah—a broad-scale civilian rebellion against Israeli\nauthority. Israel's reaction, slow and confused, was often brutal\nand highly divisive both within Israel and among Israel's\nfriends abroad. The Israelis were not alone in being surprised\nby the intifadah. The PLO did not have control over the uprising\nnor were the aging members of Arafat's coteries numbered\namong its heroes. As for Jordan, Hussein did not think the\nintifadah would last and, when it did, he feared its impact on\nhis own population.\nTHE SHULTZ INITIATIVE\nIn February 1988, as the intifadah raged, a number of Israeli\nofficials were invited to Washington to discuss the Palestinian\nrevolt.2 Among them was Elyakim Rubinstein, a former close\n2\nPalestinian leaders from the territories submitted a list of 14 demands\nto Shultz on January 14, 1988. While much of the political material was\nfamiliar, including the call for an international conference with the\nPLO in attendance, points 9-13 emphasized pragmatic issues of elections,\ntaxation, land and water—all reminiscent of the Autonomy\nnegotiations. [See Appendix XIII]\nFROM AUTONOMY TO SELF-GOVERNMENT 75\nassistant to Moshe Dayan, who had also served as the Legal\nAdvisor to the Israeli autonomy team in late 1981-82. Working\nwith Charles Hill, Secretary of State Shultz's Executive Assistant\nand a veteran of the 1981-82 period, Rubinstein reviewed the\nautonomy plan, and the Israeli positions, including the idea of\na shared control over the future development of land and water.\nLater, after studying the autonomy \"file\" himself, Shultz\nbecame convinced that the concept held promise, but needed\n\"repackaging.\" It was especially important in his view to\nshorten the time-frames both for reaching early agreements\non a transition scheme and for commencing talks on the final\nstatus of the West Bank and Gaza. This was intended to\nreassure the Palestinians that autonomy would not be an open\u0002ended \"stall\" by Israel. After a month of hectic planning and\ndiplomacy, Shultz wrote both Shamir and King Hussein on\nMarch 4, 1988 with these proposals [See Appendix XIV]:\n(1) Bilateral negotiations \"for comprehensive peace\nproviding for the security of all states in the region and for the\nlegitimate rights of the Palestinian people\" would be based on\nUN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338.\n(2) The bilateral Israeli talks with a Jordanian-Palestinian\ndelegation would set a target for agreement within six months\non \"arrangements for a transitional period.\" Seven months\nafter these discussions commenced, final status negotiations\nwould begin. Most importantly, these latter negotiations would\ncommence before the transition scheme was inaugurated or\neven agreed upon. This feature was known as the \"interlock\"\nbetween transition and final status talks. The transition period\nitself was shortened to three years.\n(3) The United States would submit a draft agreement at the\noutset on transitional arrangements in order to speed up the\nnegotiations.\n(4) Finally, the bilateral negotiations would themselves be\npreceded by an international conference, with invitations\npresented by the UN Secretary General and attended by the\nfive permanent members of the Security Council. The\nconference, however, could not impose or veto agreements. All\nparticipants had to renounce terrorism and support 242.\nThe Shultz plan tried to offer something for everybody: It\nattempted to attract Jordan through an international\n76 PALESTINIAN SELF-GOVERNMENT\nconference, protect Israel against the \"gang-up\" inherent in\nsuch a constellation, and exclude the PLO while attracting the\nPalestinians and Jordanians through the interlock feature of a\nrapid advance to final status negotiations. Probably, the \"draft\nagreement\" to be submitted by the U.S. was to be based on the\nReagan bridging proposals of 1982. The entire scheme was to\nbe propelled by the Israeli desire for transition and the Arab\ndesire for final status, the timing of both more compressed than\nCamp David.\nThis was most ambitious, especially for an administration\nin its final year, and while it combined features attractive to\neach of the parties, it fell short of their respective minimum\nrequirements. Washington still had no answer to Hussein's\nSyria problem and Syria had no interest in seeing a limited\nconference or an Israeli-Jordanian negotiation on its own. The\nPLO saw nothing in it at all. And the Israelis now saw the\nresults crossing Shamir's red lines: a UN-sponsored\nconference and significant alterations to Begin's sacrosanct\nCamp David Accord on autonomy. As an alternative to a\nconference, Shamir suggested to Shultz that the U.S. and the\nUSSR—under Gorbachev an increasingly promising source of\nJewish immigration—\"invite\" the parties to bilateral\nnegotiations.\nAn unexpected result of the U.S. effort was King Hussein's\nconclusion that he simply could do no further business with\nthe PLO or the Palestinians while the intifadah raged on.\nDisappointed and angry at Arafat's denial of a Jordanian role,\neven as the PLO enjoyed a presence in Amman to monitor\nand coordinate the revolt, the King took a dramatic step. On\nJuly 31, 1988, he announced a cutting of legal and\nadministrative ties to the West Bank, including the salaries\nJordan had since 1967 paid to about 30 percent of the local\nPalestinian public bureaucracy. This harmed both the\nJordanian and Palestinian economies far more than Hussein\nintended; there was a run on the Jordanian banks, and the\ndinar, still common currency in the West Bank, suffered a\nrapid devaluation. The King's move also signalled the U.S. that\nits concept of a joint delegation was no longer possible. By\nearly fall, Shultz's plan had petered out.\nThe U.S. seemed resigned to stalemate in the Arab-Israeli\nconflict for some time to come, and Shultz gave a kind of\nFROM AUTONOMY TO SELF-GOVERNMENT 77\nvaledictory address in September chiding all sides.3 Then the\nPalestinians again changed the situation, this time through\ndiplomacy. In November 1988, Arafat had declared a\nPalestinian State with himself as President. This was followed\nby the unthinkable. After secret exchanges through the\nSwedes and several false starts, Arafat at long last appeared to\nsatisfy America's conditions for dialogue: recognition of\nIsrael's right to exist; unconditional support of 242 and 338; and\npublic renunciation of terrorism. Shultz announced that a U.S.-\nPLO dialogue would commence forthwith but specified that\nnone of this indicated American acceptance of Arafat's two\nstate solution.4\nTHE SHAMIR-RABIN PEACE PLAN:\nAUTONOMY BECOMES SELF-RULE\nAs a consequence of both the PLO's declaration and the\nintifadah, the Israeli government found itself in early 1989 at\nthe nadir of its diplomatic fortunes. Elections in November\n1988 had given the Likud a margin over Labour but not enough\nto rule except in coalition with fringe parties pressing drastic\ndemands. Another national unity government had been\nformed, this one built around Shamir as Prime Minister while\nPeres took the Finance post. Rabin, who remained as Defense\nMinister, had been carrying out the controversial attempt to\nsuppress the intifadah by force, which led to highly publicized\nscenes of Israeli soldiers beating young Palestinian stone\u0002throwers. The course of events convinced him that Israel\nneeded a combined military-diplomatic offensive to turn the\nmounting intifadak-Vl^O tide.\nThis became all the more necessary because there was a\nnew administration in Washington. The President, George\nBush, and his Secretary of State, James A. Baker III, did not\nSecretary of State spoke to the annual policy conference of The\nWashington Institute for Near East Policy.

Moreover, there were enormous changes\nafoot in Europe and the Soviet Union that would, within two\nyears of Bush's inauguration, end the Cold War, reunite\nGermany and terminate Moscow's control of Eastern Europe.\nIsrael would have to make her case under circumstances very\ndifferent than those prevalent earlier in the decade.\nFinally, on April 6, 1989, while visiting the White House,\nShamir took the initiative. His new plan, elaborated in much\ngreater detail by the Cabinet five weeks later, consisted of four\nparts: (1) a warming of the cold Egyptian-Israeli peace to fulfill\nCamp David's objectives as the cornerstone of peace; (2) state-to\u0002state negotiations for a comprehensive settlement; (3) an\ninternational effort to resolve the refugee problem in Judea,\nSamaria and Gaza; (4) free and democratic elections \"in an\natmosphere devoid of violence, threats and terror\" to elect\nrepresentatives from the territories \"to conduct negotiations for\na transitional period of self-rule.\" A later stage would bring\nnegotiations for a permanent solution in which \"all the\nproposed options for an agreed settlement will be examined.\"\nAll of these points were to be pursued simultaneously. [See\nAppendix XV for text]\nIsrael's detailed explanations for the fourth point did indeed\nput the plan squarely in the stream of earlier conceptions of\nautonomy. It \"restored\" the Camp David formula instead of the\nShultz \"interlock\": five years of transition, with final status\ntalks to begin \"no later\" than year three. This was not new. But\nthe Israeli emphasis on electing Palestinian representatives\nand dealing with them as an independent group did break\nnew ground. Jordan and Egypt would be \"invited\" only if they\nwished to participate in transitional negotiations. For the first\ntime Israel also publicly limited its exclusive powers during\nthe transition to security, foreign affairs and jurisdiction over\nthe Israeli citizens living in the territories. And Israel also\nspecified that elections be \"regional\" rather than municipal or\nlocal.\nTwo other interesting linkages were drawn by Shamir and\nthe official Israeli commentary on the plan. First, Shamir\nstressed that self-rule would be much less risky in 1989 than it\nmight have been in 1979 because there were now 80,000\nFROM AUTONOMY TO SELF-GOVERNMENT 79\nJewish settlers.5 The second linkage concerned the impact of\nthe peace between Israel and the Arab states on the negotiations\nover the territories' final status: \"its realization [full peace]—or\nnon-realization—will determine what kind of concessions\nIsrael will (or will not) be able to offer the Palestinian Arabs\nwhen the future political status of Judea, Samaria and the Gaza\nDistrict will come up for discussion.\"6\nThere was one notable omission from the Israeli initiative.\nNowhere, not in the Cabinet communique, not in Shamir's\nspeech, and not in official commentary does the word\n\"autonomy\" appear. Instead, \"self-rule\" becomes the Israeli\nterm of choice.\nIn terms of Israel's decade-old approach to the Palestinian\nissue, these were very forward proposals and they\nimmediately achieved their first objective of appealing to\nWashington. But would they appeal to the Arabs? Secretary of\nState Baker soon concluded that the key to movement was point\nfour, the elections. And here there was a catch: the \"selection\"\nbefore the \"election.\" Who would become the Palestinian\ninterlocutors from the territories with whom Israel could reach\nagreement on election procedures? How would they be\nchosen? Rabin preferred ambiguity: \"We'll know them when\nwe see them.\"7 Shamir suggested that the U.S. and Egypt could\nbe helpful in selecting the list.8 The PLO, of course, would be\nexcluded.\nBaker found, however, that Palestinian (and Egyptian)\nsupport depended on an \"outsider\" and an Arab from East\nJerusalem being included as part of the delegation. The reader\nwho has toiled this far will recognize immediately the\nDEnglish translation of Knesset statement, May 17, 1989, under imprint\nof the Israeli Embassy, Washington D.C. as communicated by Shamir's\nmedia advisor and as delivered on IDF radio.\n\"Background Paper, Embassy of Israel Washington D.C, \"Commentary\nand Analysis,\" Jerusalem, May 14, 1989.\n'Comment to The Washington Institute for Near East Policy Study Group,\nJune 1989.\n^Comment to The Washington Institute for Near East Policy Study Group,\nJune 1989.\n80 PALESTINIAN SELF-GOVERNMENT\nPalestinian purpose of reinserting the PLO's constituency from\n\"outside\" the territories on the one hand and asserting its\nclaim to Jerusalem on the other. Eventually, in October 1989,\nBaker advanced a five-point framework for an Israeli\u0002Palestinian \"dialogue\" in Cairo to be preceded by a U.S.-Israeli\u0002Egyptian meeting in Washington which would agree on a list\nand an agenda.9 The Israeli Cabinet accepted this proposal\nalong with six(!) assumptions about it on November 5.10 A\nmonth later, on December 6, Egypt accepted as well, attaching\na PLO response for Baker and trumping the six Israeli\nassumptions with even more of its own.11\nThe path now seemed open to possible compromises on the\nmain sticking points over the Palestinian list. The U.S.\nproposed that the parties accept Palestinians who were prepared\nto support the two phase (transitional/final status) process\nsuggested by Israel and who otherwise subscribed to UN\nResolutions 242, 338 and anti-terrorism. The Americans still\nhoped to satisfy the Palestinian requirements by selecting a\n\"deportee\"—a Palestinian expelled from the territories for anti\u0002Israel activities but who, even under Israeli law, had a residual\nright to return. As for Jerusalem, the solution might be to\nchoose a dual addressee: a candidate with two residences, one\noutside the city.\nThese were exercises in parallax diplomacy. Viewed from\none side they offered the PLO and the West Bankers the\npresence they demanded; viewed from the Israeli side, these\nPalestinian interlocutors could still plausibly be regarded as\n^Among other items, Baker's points also stated U.S. \"understandings\"\nthat Israel would attend only if a \"satisfactory\" list of Palestinians\n\"worked out.\" See Mideast Mirror, December 7, 1989, for texts of U.S.,\nIsraeli and Egyptian \"points.\"\nThese included Israel's insistance on negotiating only with acceptable\nresidents of the West Bank and Gaza, exclusion of the PLO, and the\nagenda to be Palestinian elections in the framework of Israel's peace\nproposal.\n''I n early September, Egypt had published a ten-point plan differing\nwith the Israeli election proposal and insisting that Israel accept, among\nother items, an end to settlement activities, the exchange of land for\npeace and East Jerusalem Arab participation in the elections. See Mideast\nMirror, op. tit.\nFROM AUTONOMY TO SELF-GOVERNMENT 81\n\"inhabitants\" of the territories, neither PLO nor Jerusalemite.\nBut the parties had to want to see it that way.\nBefore the Americans could be sure of that, and before the\nWashington meeting could be held, there was a dramatic\ninterlude as events elsewhere captured the world's attention.\nThe Berlin Wall came down. Not long thereafter, the process\nof German reunification began as the East German regime\nrapidly collapsed. A general European crisis seemed at hand.\nWhen the U.S. resumed its push in early 1990, parallax\ndiplomacy came close but still fell short. Weakened by\nopposition in his own party and under severe public pressure\nfrom both the United States and his Labour Party partner,\nShamir lost the Unity Government on March 15, 1990, rather\nthan accept the American proposals. In the sensational\nmaneuvers that always attend the formation of an Israeli\ngovernment, Shamir bested Peres once more, managing to\nform a new coalition well to the political right. Shamir's ally\nMoshe Arens became Defense Minister while the three Likud\npoliticians most opposed to the U.S. proposals were given\nimportant offices: David Levy, new to international affairs,\nbecame Foreign Minister; Yitzhak Moda'i took Finance; and\nAriel Sharon was assigned to run what had become the new\nGovernment's highest priority, creating housing for the flood\nof Soviet immigrants.\nTHE GULF WAR AND ITS AFTERMATH:\n\"INTERIM SELF-GOVERNMENT\"\nThere the matter might have remained for some time if not\nfor Iraq's seizure of Kuwait and Saddam Hussein's attempt to\nlink the Arab-Israeli conflict to his own aggression in the Gulf.\nAt the time, this tactic earned Saddam the enthusiastic support\nof the PLO and the Palestinians living on both sides of the\nJordan River, contributing heavily to King Hussein's own \"tilt\"\ntoward the Iraqis. It did not touch off popular uprisings\nelsewhere, instead revolting both the Israelis and the former\nPalestinian strongholds of support amongst the Gulf\nSheikhdoms—especially Saudi Arabia.\nWhile the U.S. resisted this linkage, President Bush made\nclear on more than one occasion, including in his speech to\nthe United Nations on October 1, 1990, that once the crisis was\nresolved he would resume a push for Arab-Israeli peace. On\n82 PALESTINIAN SELF-GOVERNMENT\nMarch 6, 1991, after announcing the victory over Iraq, Bush\nalso told the Congress that \"the time has come to end the Arab\u0002Israeli conflict\" on the basis of security, land for peace and\nlegitimate Palestinian rights. Within two weeks of the war,\nSecretary of State Baker was sent out to \"catalyze\" the dormant\npeace process.\nAfter an exhausting series of visits, Baker was able to report\na narrowing of differences on a proposal to convene a\n\"regional\" peace conference. Almost unnoticed in the\ncontroversies over the conference procedures was Baker's\nstatement to a House subcommittee on May 22 that he found\n\"agreement that the negotiations between Israel and the\nPalestinians would proceed in phases, with talks on interim\nself-government preceding negotiations over the permanent\nstatus of the Occupied Territories\" [See Appendix XVI]. Then\non May 31, President Bush wrote the leaders of Egypt, Israel,\nJordan and Syria asking them to accept the U.S. approach to a\nconference: it should be a ceremonial prelude to bilateral\nnegotiations based on 242 and 338; the UN should be\nrepresented by a mute observer; European and Gulf Council\nobservers would also be present; and it could not be reconvened\nwithout mutual consent.\nA month later, Prime Minister Shamir rejected the\nPresident's ideas, but Syria's surprise acceptance of the\nconference format on July 14, 1991 soon led to an Israeli\nreversal. As it turned out, the Israelis were far more interested\nin the problem of Palestinian representation and on that issue,\nthe Gulf War had brought about a considerable change. The\nLikud government had discovered the virtues of King Hussein,\neven as a buffer publicly sympathetic to Iraq. Though the\nKing's performance had put him and Jordan in bad odour with\nthe victors, Shamir was arguing that nonetheless the King had\na crucial role to play: the senior Arab partner of the\nPalestinians. Israel therefore insisted that the Palestinians be\npart of a Jordanian delegation—so long as neither PLO figures\nnor an East Jerusalemite were on it.\nThe new Israeli position was actually an old one, reverting\nto the original Camp David approach. In the first stage of\nnegotiations over an interim agreement Palestinians were to be\npart of the Egyptian and Jordanian delegations, not their own\ngroup. Only after an autonomy agreement had been reached\nwould elections for a Sclf-Governing Authority legitimize the\nFROM AUTONOMY TO SELF-GOVERNMENT 83\nPalestinians on their own. Shamir's 1989 plan had reversed\nthis sequence, treating the Palestinians as a political force\nindependently of the Arab states—an oblique testimony to the\nachievement of the intifadah. But now the gains of the intifadah\nhad been wiped out in the Palestinians' fatal alliance with\nSaddam. Shamir was thus able to insist on Palestinian\nrepresentation that excluded PLO \"outsiders\" and Jerusalem\n\"insiders\"—the very proposals that had broken his\ngovernment the year before—in the context of a Jordanian\ndelegation.\nOn October 17, 1991, Secretary Baker and Soviet Foreign\nMinister Boris Pankin were able to announce from Jerusalem\nthat a peace conference would be held in Madrid on October\n30. The Palestinians would be participating as members of a\njoint delegation with Jordan. Two days later, on October 19,\nIsrael formally agreed to attend the conference.\nThis turn of events ratified the astonishing reversal of\nPalestinian political fortunes and an equally astonishing\nrevival of the interim \"self-government\" concept. The decade\nof the eighties had begun with the most vigorous Palestinian\nrejections of autonomy. As the years passed, the PLO's cause\ngrew stronger, reaching its apogee in 1988 when the intifadah\nand Arafat's statements earned it a dialogue with the U.S. But\nnot twenty-four months later, the tide sweeping toward\nPalestinian statehood had crested and crashed, leaving upon\nthe diplomatic sands the shards of the disastrous Iraqi alliance.\nThe Palestinians, even to be part of a negotiation, were now\nface to face with \"self-government\" as the best they would get,\nshorn of even symbolic expressions of their national\naspirations or their claim to Jerusalem. In their long struggle to\nemerge as an independent actor, the Palestinians had now but\na single part to play: as members of a joint delegation with\nJordan to negotiate not independence but Self-Government\n(Autonomy).\n\nvn AMERICAN POLICY AND\nPALESTINIAN SELF-GOVERNMENT\nThe United States is now poised to help Israel, Jordan and\nthe Palestinians take up Palestinian self-government\n(autonomy) for the West Bank and Gaza, under far more\nfavorable circumstances than ever before. First, unlike the\n1979-82 period, there is no substantial Arab Rejectionist Front,\nnor a Soviet superpower willing to arm it. Those Arabs who\nreject peace negotiations are either defeated or weak and they\ncannot look to external powers for effective support. Second,\nAmerican mediation—Washington's words of support or\nopposition—will carry very great weight. After the victory over\nIraq and the collapse of the Soviet Union, more than ever before\nthere is no alternative to the United States as the sole outside\npower best able to reduce the risks and enlarge the rewards in\nreaching agrement. Third and most important, the local\nparties have persuasive reasons to seek a change in the status\nquo.\nIsrael's most dangerous enemies are at bay but the country\nneeds economic and political reforms and faces a huge burden\nof new immigration; simultaneously, tensions between Arabs\nand Jews are worse than ever; and external pressures for a\nresolution of the conflict are mounting. The Palestinians are\nsuffering a season of reverses: a fresh flood of refugees from\nthe Gulf, the end of broad Arab support for their cause, little to\nshow for the heavy casualties of the intifadah, and a mounting\nIsraeli settler population in their midst. And Jordan, itself\nisolated from its traditional friends by its position during the\n85\n86 PALESTINIAN SELF-GOVERNMENT\nGulf War, is more than ever a state whose destiny is\ndetermined by the ebb and flow of the Palestinian issue.\nIn short, the parties badly need a change towards peace,\ninternational politics favor it, and the United States is well\nplaced to encourage it.\nEnthusiasm in this case, however, needs the counsel of both\nexperience from past peacemaking and a keen sense of what\nPalestinian Self-Government can and cannot do to resolve the\nArab-Israeli conflict.\nLESSONS FROM THE PAST1\nFirst, the United States should sustain a certain balance in its\nrelationships to the local protagonists. The U.S. is an ally of\nIsrael committed to its security but also vitally interested in\ngood relations with the Arabs and eager for a settlement of the\ndraining conflict between the two. American policy has\nusually operated in this context and any substantial change—\ne.g., the end of alliance with Israel, loss of interest in the Arabs\nor passivity about the conflict—will convince one or another of\nthe parties that Washington is dangerous to its vital interests.\nThe resulting friction will force the U.S. either to impose a\nsettlement or to abandon the quest—neither a recipe for an\nenduring peace.\nSecond, the United States should encourage the parties to\nfind and build on common interests. American diplomacy\nhas been able to \"broker\" lasting deals only between parties\nwho really wanted to make them. By \"broker\" I mean that\nrather than creating a U.S. plan to force on the parties, the U.S.\ninstead reinforced common interests by reducing the risks for\nIsrael and its Arab negotiating partner so that they could agree\non their own basic terms. In contrast, every attempt to put\nforward an American plan prematurely has relieved the\nregional powers of having to do anything except resist—a\nfamous Middle Eastern art form. There is a place for American\nadvocacy, but only when the parties have come sufficiently\nclose to each other that a \"bridging\" proposal originated by\nWashington is both practical and clearly desired.\n^This portion draws partly on Kenneth W. Stein and Samuel W. Lewis,\nMaking Peace Among Arabs and Israelis: Lessons from Fifty Years of Negotiating\nExperience, (Washington, D.C.: United States Institute of Peace, 1991).\nAMERICAN POLICY AND PALESTINIAN SELF-GOVERNMENT 87\nThird, while the USSR may be co-chairman of a\nconference and the European states will continue to play some\nrole, they are not alternatives to the U.S., although their actions\ncould harm American efforts. Only the United States has\nsufficient clout and credibility with all sides to ease their very\ndifficult choices. And upon the United States falls the task of\nkeeping the other political hounds either at bay or making the\nright sounds: keeping the signals straight and the atmosphere\nconducive to progress.\nFourth, the United States should be continually involved.\nWhile direct talks are an important psychological\nbreakthrough, especially for Israel, they do not guarantee\nsuccess. If the Egyptian-Israeli negotiations are any guide, then\nthe parties will be loathe to make open concessions to each\nother and in any event they will look to the U.S. to reduce their\nrisks when they do. And for the United States, the most critical\ndimension of this new round of diplomacy will be to evoke\nmovement by the parties toward each other based on their\noverlapping interests, rather than what they imagine will play\nin Washington.\nFifth, there is no substitute for the President. The time\u0002consuming twists and turns of Arab-Israeli negotiations also\nraise questions about the bureaucratics of the American\napproach: how much time ought to be spent and who should\nspend it? What are the respective roles of working experts, the\nSecretary of State, the President, and a Special Negotiator—if\nany? A decade and a half of experience yields these clues:\nA strong working group is indispensable not only to pave\nthe way and clean up the debris but to \"signal\" a troubling state\nof play or an opportunity to those higher up.\nThe Secretary of State or a high-level personal\nrepresentative (Special Negotiator) of either the Secretary or the\nWhite House can effectively deal with 90 percent of the issues\nproviding that the official is regarded by the parties as\ncompetent, empathetic (if not sympathetic) and authoritative,\ni.e., his position is likely to be upheld by higher authority.\nNonetheless the most important final compromises will\nrequire direct presidential intervention. When the parties are\nready to take the final risk, they will want the President to be\nholding their hands as they leap—and they will want him to\nleap with them.\n88 PALESTINIAN SELF-GOVERNMENT\nWith these points in mind, the two questions posed at the\noutset of this study should now be answered. First, will Self\u0002Government (Autonomy) solve the Palestinian problem or at\nleast put it on the road to solution? The answer is that Self\u0002Government cannot solve the Palestinian problem\nimmediately, but properly conceived it is a vital step forward\nthat will contribute eventually to a solution. Second, how\nshould the United States help to bring it about? The answer is\nthat Washington can use its special influence to broker a direct\nIsraeli-Palestinian-Jordanian negotiation that builds on their\ncommon interest and reduces their risks, especially in the\ncrucial areas of resources and military security.\nTHE PALESTINIAN PROBLEM AND\nTHE POLITICS OF CONSENT\nIf Palestinian Self-Government is to play a significant role\nin resolving the Arab-Israeli conflict then it must be based on a\ncareful understanding of that much abused phrase, the\n\"Palestinian Problem.\" The problem can be stated precisely in\ngeopolitical terms: who shall rule, Arab or Jew, over the\nterritory defined after World War I as the \"British Mandate for\nPalestine\"? History's answer since 1921 has been Hashemite\nrule over the East Bank of the Jordan; after 1948, Israeli rule\nover part of the area west of the river, with Egypt and Jordan\nruling over the rest; and, after 1967, Israeli control over all of\nwestern Palestine between the river and the sea while Jordan\ncontinues its control over the East Bank.\nIsrael and Hashemite Jordan might have composed their\nquarrel some time ago if their interests alone were at stake.\nEven under the so-called state of war, various Israeli\ngovernments and Jordanian monarchs have had amicable\nthough unofficial relations, despite their clashes in 1948 and\n1967. But they are not the only claimants to Palestine.\nThere live throughout the original mandate territory Arabs\nwho consider themselves to be \"Palestinians,\" that is, neither\nJordanians nor Israelis.2 Some are Jordanian citizens (half or\nmore of the East Bank population) and some are Israeli citizens\n^Population figures are drawn from \"Palestinian Projections for 16\nCountries/Areas of the World: 1990 to 2010.\" Washington D.C.: U.S.\nBureau of the Census, September 1990-March 1991, unpublished.\nAMERICAN POLICY AND PALESTINIAN SELF-GOVERNMENT 89\nten percent). A large group, a million and a half, live in the\nreas known as the West Bank and Gaza, hold Jordanian\nlassports or are stateless refugees under Israeli military\ngovernment. These and about 3.5 to 4 million living around\nhe Middle East, and elsewhere, see themselves as either the\nightful rulers of all of Palestine on both banks; or as the\nightful rulers of all of western Palestine (Israel but not Jordan).\nv!ore recently the Palestinians have tried to define their first\nlaim as a right to the areas captured by Israel in the Six-Day\nA\n7\narof 1967.\nThus, the historical issue of \"who shall rule Palestine\" has\nleveloped into the current question: \"Should there be another\n\\rab sovereignty—Palestinian sovereignty—over the areas\niccupied by Israel since 1967\"?\nIsrael's answer has been \"no\" on the grounds of security\ndone, reinforced by Israel's own historical claims. But Israel\nor various reasons has never extended its domestic law into\nThat the Israelis call Judea, Samaria and the Gaza District\n(except for Jerusalem). An Israeli government that did so\n.vould face enormous foreign and domestic opposition. The\nresulting state would certainly have a smaller Jewish majority,\nihe new Soviet Jewish immigrants notwithstanding, and its\nuiture as ajewish state would be questionable.\nJordan's answer has been \"yes\" if the independent Arab\nPalestine promptly joined in some sort of political union with\nit. But Jordanian rule over the West Bank between 1948 to 1967\nwas widely resented by the Palestinians, and the monarchy\nfought a bitter civil war against the PLO in 1970. Despite two\nmajor efforts in the 1980s, King Hussein and Yasser Arafat\nfailed to agree on their precise relationship before entering a\nnegotiation as a joint delegation. And Israel has refused a\nterritorial redivision along any lines that would interest Jordan\nito go it alone without the Palestinians.\nFinally, the Palestinian answer has been \"yes\" to\nTilastin,\" an independent Palestinian state, on the grounds of\nitheir own right to self-determination and security. But the\nIPalestinians have failed to convince Israel (and others) that\ntheir \"two-state\" solution would not threaten Israeli security. To\nthe contrary: both the inlifadah and the widespread and vocal\nPalestinian support for Iraqi missile attacks on Israel have\nconvinced many that their aspiration is the destruction of the\n90 PALESTINIAN SELF-GOVERNMENT\nJewish state entirely, for which purpose the two-state solution is\na stepping stone.\nThis mutual deadlock of competing and incompatible\naspirations gives the Arab-Israeli conflict its special quality of\nbitter paralysis. Politics, however, is not only about aspirations:\nwhat people want. It is also about consent: what people will\naccept—even at some cost to their ideals—because there exists\nan overriding interest to do so.\nThe overriding interest in this case is not what self\u0002government will do to fix the final status but what it can do to\nget beyond the terrors of the status quo. It should be clear from\nthe outset that self-government (autonomy) for the Palestinians\ncannot satisfy the ultimate aspirations of any of the parties. By\ndefinition, self-government (autonomy) is a concept of limits.\nA self-governing authority will not be a full fledged\ninternational citizen—a state. Nor will it be a domesticated\nanimal, that is, fully part of another state's laws. Those who\naspire to extend, reclaim, or establish sovereignty over the\nareas in question will never find complete satisfaction in Self\u0002Government.\nEqually futile will be any attempt to define self-government\n(autonomy) according to immaculate concepts of international\nlaw. In fact, the virtue of the concept is precisely its flexibility,\ndepending on political requirements. It should come as no\nsurprise to learn, as one eminent jurist long ago concluded,\nthat \"on no subject of international law has there been so much\nloose writing and nebulous speculation . . . \"3\nNo doubt this author will add (or has already added!) his\nportion to the received body of loose writing and nebulous\nspeculation. But if self-government is deficient, as judged\nagainst the respective ideals of Israel, Jordan and the\nPalestinians (and of international legal clarity), it is no more\ndeficient than the status quo. None of the parties contesting\ncontrol over the West Bank and Gaza are going to achieve their\nideals in the foreseeable future. The issue therefore is not\n3\nJohn Chipman Grey, The Nature and Sources of the Law (1909), quoted in\n\"The Concept of Autonomy in International Law\" Hurst Hannum and\nRichard B. Lillich, in Yoram Dinstein.ed., Models of Autonomy (New\nBrunswick: Transaction Books, 1981), p. 215. Hannum and Lillich\nproduced a two-volume study for the Department of State in 1979-80 on\n\"The Theory and Practice of Governmental Autonomy.\"\nAMERICAN POLICY AND PALESTINIAN SELF-GOVERNMENT 91\nwhether self-government achieves an ideal but rather, whether\nit meets the practical test for which the parties will give their\nconsent: is it better than the status quo?\nThat test must first be passed with the Palestinians. They\nare the weakest party, the party furthest from the ideal and by\nfar suffering the most from the status quo. Over 1000, mostly\nyoung, Palestinians have lost their lives in the four-year\nrebellion against Israeli rule (the intifadah). Their economy has\nbeen wrecked by the intifadah and the sudden impoverishment\nor dislocation of prosperous Gulf exile communities.\nPalestinian support for Iraq in the Gulf War also dashed\nwhatever support they had in Israeli political movements such\nas \"Peace Now.\" And, of course, the Israeli settler population\ncontinues to grow. Yet for these very reasons they have the\nmost to gain from Self-Government and the most to lose should\nnegotiations fail. Palestinian consent, however, will require a\nnew dawning of pragmatic politics.\nThe emotional barriers should not be underestimated. The\nPalestinians believe that they were turned from a majority to a\nminority in their own country in less than a man's lifetime;\nthat their Arab brothers failed to rescue them and often\nexploited their misery; and that the United States in particular\nhas allowed Israel to deny them the most elementary national\nand human rights. This sense of historic wrong and\noppression has only been deepened by recent events. For them\nthe Gulf War was an opportunity to threaten Israel militarily\nand to protest what they regarded as a double-standard, yet it\nresulted in the devastation of the Palestinian community in\nKuwait, a further alienation from Western sympathies and\nwidespread loss of support throughout the Gulf—the great\nfinancial pillar of the Palestinian struggle.\nWhile unified in their resentment, the Palestinians have\nfound political unity elusive. Violent personal rivalries and\nshifting alliances have marked their political history,\nmanipulated throughout by various Arab states: Egypt, Syria,\nIraq, Saudi Arabia, Jordan have each attempted to capture either\npart or all of the Palestinian cause for their own purposes.4 The\nPalestinians are also divided by their location: the \"insiders,\"\n4\nIn fact, the creation of the PLO in 1964 was largely an attempt by then\nEgyptian President Gamal Abdul Nasser to solidify Palestinian\nnationalists under his patronage.\n92 PALESTINIAN SELF-GOVERNMENT\nthose under Israeli military rule in the West Bank and Gaza,\nand the \"outsiders,\" the Palestinian exiles and emigres\nscattered around the Middle East and elsewhere. The\n\"insiders\" have been more pragmatic if by pragmatism is\nmeant accommodation to the fact of Israeli rule. Their\nparticular grievances—except for Jerusalem—are not territorial\nbut political: who rules and how it is done. Most of the Gazans,\nhowever, share with the \"outside\" Palestinian diaspora a\nterritorial claim to pre-1967 Israel that cannot be settled by\nPalestinian self-government in the post-1967 West Bank.\nExcept for a few occasions when the \"insiders\" got their\nway on tactical issues, such as municipal elections in 1976, the\nPLO and its factions gave the Palestinians under occupation\nwhat leadership they had until late 1987. But the intifadah was\npurely a product of the \"inside\" and raised the issue of whether\nthose bearing the heaviest burden of the struggle should not\nalso assume more of a role in the diplomacy that might end or\nat least ease the conflict. And the \"insiders,\" including a new\ngroup empowered either by their generalship of the intifadah or\ntheir espousal of Islamic purity, did make a mark, and not\nonly in the war of images and nerves. Thus, resistance to the\nIsraelis in Gaza, where the Islamic Hamas Party is strongest,\nhas led Israel to diminish if not relinquish its presence rather\nthan completely quash the rebellion. And in the U.S.-\nsponsored diplomacy of 1989, which broke down over\nPalestinian representation, the PLO seemed prepared to let the\ninsiders take the initial steps.\nIndeed Shamir's elections proposal stimulated a lively\ndebate among Palestinians over a Palestinian \"initiative,\" not to\nnegotiate autonomy but to reform the PLO. This polemic was\ngiven additional force after the Gulf War. While Iraq's cause\nhad been popular in the territories, the PLO's handling of the\nsituation was regarded as disastrous, bolstering the case for\n\"new blood\" and \"new concepts.\" One idea hotly discussed\nwas to run elections that would enlarge the role of \"insiders\"\nin the Palestine National Council, to be followed by an\nagreement with Jordan on confederation, even before\nnegotiating with Israel.5 Israel presumably would use the\n5\nSee Radi Jerrai in Al Fajr (an English-language Palestinian weekly\npublished in Jerusalem), April 1, 1991, p. 4.

And they reflect the desire of those who would\nnegotiate to do so without a personally dangerous rejection of\nthe defiant symbol of Palestinian unity—Yasser Arafat, since\nNovember 15, 1988, self-declared President of the State of\nFilastin (Palestine).\nWhile, in the absence of any alternative, the \"insiders\" and\nthose advocating the diplomatic route are bound to gain\nstrength in one way or another, Palestinians inclined to\nnegotiate face great personal and collective risks. A Palestinian\nRejectionist Front, whether intifadist, Islamicist or terrorist in\norigin, will threaten any delegation.7 Self-Government for the\nWest Bank and Gaza inherently emphasizes the \"inside\" over\nthe \"outside.\" And the Palestinians have reason to fear that the\nArab states, once they are into the diplomacy, will reach their\nown deals with Israel, leaving the Palestinians without\nleverage and without prospects.\nYet even as those Palestinians who want a diplomatic\nprocess argue their need for a promise of self-determination\nand a visible role for the \"outsiders\" (the PLO), there is a\ngrowing recognition that self-government may be the only\npractical way to advance. De facto chief \"inside\" interlocutor\nFaisal Husseini's account of one of his meetings with U.S.\nSecretary of State James Baker illustrates the point: \".. . James\nBaker said to us, 'You will obtain a little less than a state and\nmore than autonomy.' We replied, 'We don't want to\nexchange slogans, but to discuss the substance. This entity you\nrefer to, will it be able to apply the right of return for the\nPalestinians scattered and persecuted around the world? If so,\n6\nSee Daoud Kuttab, The Washington Post, April 16, 1989.\n'The leadership of the intifadah itself has passed from a Unified National\nCommand composed of local grassroots leaders, to bands of increasingly\nviolent youths, unanswerable to virtually any authority.\n94 PALESTINIAN SELF-GOVERNMENT\nwe can talk' . . . \"8 Compared with Begin's original proposal\n(point 21) for a joint Israeli-Palestinian-Jordanian Committee to\nregulate the return of refugees to the territories, one can see the\nmakings of a practical negotiation over even this sensitive\nissue.\nThere is a developing record of possible Palestinian\npositions on the details of self-government. As noted earlier, an\nextensive survey was done by one researcher immediately\nafter Camp David. More recently a full scale peace plan was\npublished by Palestinian lawyer and journalist Talal Abu\nAfifeh (al-Safi), reportedly a Fatah activist.9 From these plans\nreported in the Palestinian media one can assemble a\nPalestinian position on \"interim self-government\":\n• The goal of transition is to facilitate the final status of\nPalestinian independence.\n• The PLO must have a role so that insider-outsider unity\ncan be sustained.\n• Strict limitations must be placed on Israel's military\nmovement.\n• Palestinians must enjoy total control over land, water\nand resources.\n• Israeli settlement activity should be frozen either before\nnegotiations begin or certainly when the transition period\nstarts; and they should eventually be removed or subject to\nPalestinian authority.\n• Provisions must be made for the return of refugees to the\nself-governing territory\n• East Jerusalem must be included as the projected capital\nof the Palestinian entity—physically undivided but politically\nseparate.10\n\"Interview, Journal of Palestine Studies, Volume XX, No. 4, Summer 1991, p.\n107.\n\"Dr. Ann Lesch, Journal of Palestinine Studies, Volume IX, No. 3, Spring\n1980, pp.189-91, and Talal Abu Afifeh (al-Safi) in Al-Fajr, May 13, 1991.\nAl-Safi's credentials include numerous arrests for security felonies,\nincluding two years in jail for leading a Fatah group.\nTalal Abu Afifeh (al-Safi) suggests a UN role over East Jerusalem as an\nalternative to exclusive Palestinian control.\nAMERICAN POLICY AND PALESTINIAN SELF-GOVERNMENT 95\n• The interim stages agreement must be under\nInternational or UN supervision including (if requested) a UN\ncivilian and military presence.\n• And some Palestinian-Jordanian political accord,\nusually called a \"Confederation,\" would be reached.\nMany of these positions, of course, contradict both the\nIsraeli and American concept that the interim agreement\nought not determine in advance the outcome of final status\nnegotiations. Like the Egyptian model circa 1980, the\nPalestinian sources see the interim self-government as a state\nin swaddling clothes, the passage of time serving largely to\nextend Palestinian control and remove the Israeli presence\nuntil an independent state linked to Jordan emerges in full\nsovereignty. Even if the Palestinians fail to obtain full scale\nassurances of this outcome before negotiations, they can be\nexpected to judge each detail by whether it contributes to\nimpending statehood. [See Appendix XVII for selected\nPalestinian quotes on self-government]\nThis approach may satisfy Palestinian ideals, but it suffers\notherwise from severe defects. It will be forestalled by both\nIsrael and the United States—perhaps also by Jordan—if the\nmeaning of confederation is not clarified. It will accentuate the\nshortcomings of every agreement the Palestinians do reach by\nputting any attempt at self-government to the test of statehood—\nwhich, as argued earlier, by definition, it cannot pass.\nThus, if a Palestinian strategy for self-government is to\nsucceed, more pragmatic goals must inform the Palestinian\neffort:\n• getting rid of the military government and its\nintrusions;\n• gaining some control over land, water and resources;\n• improving the economy of the area so that it can\n\"absorb\" both the \"inside\" refugees and make a start on the\nmost destitute of the outsiders;\n• establishing secure and democratic institutions.\nThese are tall orders in themselves. They do not guarantee\na state but they are certainly necessary building blocks to the\nfurther political development of the Palestinians. And at a\nminimum they will make it more difficult than ever for Israel\nto annex or absorb the territories. Palestinian Self-Government\noffers a potential solution to what Edward Said defined as his\npeople's most pressing dilemma: \".. . a national movement\n96 PALESTINIAN SELF-GOVERNMENT\nthat despite its many achievements . . . has not discovered a\nmethod for stopping or containing the relentless Israeli attempt\nto take over more and more Palestinian (as well as other Arab)\nterritory.\"11\nTHE JORDANIAN OPTION REVISITED\nThe next test for consent is Jordan, containing a population\nmore than half of whom are considered to be Palestinians.\nWhile the Palestinian nationalists have long conceived of\nJordan as a necessary backdrop, ally and potential confederate,\nthey have never been able to reach an enduring satisfactory\nrelationship with its Hashemite rulers. From 1948 to 1967,\nwhen King Abdullah and later King Hussein held the upper\nhand in the West Bank, the Palestinians were kept firmly in\nsecond political place, although individuals were allowed high\npositions in the Court and Royal Administration. Beginning\nin 1968, the reborn PLO run by Arafat almost took over Jordan\nand a savage civil war ensued, culminating in Jordan's violent\nexpulsion of the PLO in September 1970. The PLO's later\ndisaster in Lebanon and subsequent deadly quarrel with Syria\ngave King Hussein an opening to reassert his leadership, but\nneither in 1982-83 nor later in 1985 could the King and Arafat\nagree on a lasting political modus vivendi for negotiations.\nFinally in 1988, Jordan officially \"withdrew\" from the\nPalestinian scene as the intifadah strengthened the PLO's hand.\nNow both parties find themselves forced to work together on\na joint delegation to peace talks and joint negotiations on self\u0002government (autonomy), a turn of events neither sought nor\nexpected. The outcome will depend heavily on Jordan's own\nview of the virtues of Palestinian self-government.\nKing Hussein, unlike Yasser Arafat, has staged an\nastonishing recovery from the Gulf War during which his\n\"tilt\" toward Iraq appeared to cost him vital international\nsupport. By avoiding the twin disasters of either civil war (by\nadopting an anti-Iraq posture) or becoming a combatant (by\nattacking Israel) the King achieved a political feat unique even\nby Middle East standards: he became simultaneously popular\nEdward Said, \"Reflections on Twenty Years of Palestinian History,\"\nJournal of Palestine Studies, Volume XX, No. 4, Summer 1991, p. 5.\nAMERICAN POLICY AND PALESTINIAN SELF-GOVERNMENT 97\nwith both the Palestinians and with Israel's Likud government.\nNow, as the designated \"senior\" partner of the Palestinians, his\ncrucial role reaffirmed by Israel, Hussein is well on the way to\nshedding the discredited mufti of Saddam's ally for the more\nfamiliar cloak of Arab moderate.\nThese astonishing events, however, do not speak directly to\nJordan's real interest and probable behavior when it comes to\nPalestinian self-government. The simple answer is that Jordan\nmust have a role. The King cannot ignore the attachments of\nhis Palestinian subjects, yet he cannot allow those attachments\nalone to determine his policy. Hussein's own concept of his\ndynasty's historic destiny is balanced against his justly famed\ninstinct for survival.\nIt may be fashionable to pit the Palestinian nationalists as\nthe antithesis of a bedouin-influenced monarchy, but Hussein\nactually regards himself as the supreme nationalist.12 His\nfamily's role in the Arab Revolt is a legacy that qualifies\nHussein—in his own eyes—to be in the vanguard of those who\ncherish Arab political independence and dignity. As a\ndescendant of the Prophet, and inheritor of the title Sherif, the\nKing will never take second place to the Islamists, although he\ndoes not press upon his subjects the dogmas of religion.\nThis being said, Hussein has throughout his career\nmanifested a healthy respect for popular opinion, especially\nPalestinian. A large part of his population is tied by kinship,\nculture and history to the other side of the river; their causes\nand passions have involved him in civil war and war with\nIsrael, and more recently made it impossible for him to openly\nside with the West in the Gulf crisis.\nAnother significant constant with which the King must\nreckon is Jordan's poverty. Jordan's lack of natural resources\nand indigenous wealth contribute to its regional vulnerability,\nand its immediate neighbors are all more powerful militarily\nthan Jordan can ever be. Even worse, each could be suspected\nof harboring ambitions for Jordan—seen from Jerusalem as an\nextension of the Land of Israel, seen from Damascus as part of\nhistoric Greater Syria and seen from Saudi Arabia as a natural\n12\n See Uriel Dann, The Survival Strategy of King Hussein In Historical\nPerspective, (Forthcoming from The Washington Institute), an d\nHussein's own autobiography, Uneasy Lies the Head, (London :\nHeinemann, 1962).\n98 PALESTINIAN SEIJ-GOVERNMENT\nextension of the Hijaz. As a result, the King has always sought\nallies from outside the region both to survive and to prosper.\nGiven its East Bank (i.e. non-Palestinian) power structure,\nloyal Bedouin army and a ruler keenly aware of the country's\ngeopolitical vulnerability, Jordan could ill afford the extreme\npolitics of the Palestinians. More than most of the Arab rulers\nwho brought the catastrophe of 1967, Hussein was guilty in\nPalestinian eyes of having failed to protect them. Thereafter,\nJordan posed as the power best able to recover the lost territories,\nbut was never able to get the \"goods\" in the form of an\nacceptable Israeli territorial withdrawal or to \"deliver\" them in\nthe form of Palestinian acquiescence to Jordan's senior role.\nThe Palestinians know and Hussein knows that while\noccasionally he will be with them, Hashemite Jordan will\nnever be o/them. The King's survival (and Jordan's) depends\non his control or containment of the Palestinians, not\nbecoming an instrument of their cause.\nThis basic fissure at the core of Jordanian-Palestinian\nrelations has made it impossible for Jordan and the PLO to\nreach a settled relationship that might regulate their future.\nDetails of the failed Hussein-Arafat agreements in 1982-83 and\nthe even more frustrating attempt at coordination in 1988 have\nthis thread in common: the Palestinians will not grant Jordan\nsenior partnership and Jordan will not grant the Palestinians a\nblank check of confederation. This difference had become\nclear even earlier when in 1974 Hussein made a major effort to\nredefine the Kingdom's constitution, apparently granting the\nWest Bank (upon its return to Jordanian sovereignty) more\nweight. The \"United Kingdom\" scheme, however, failed to\nattract much support, undermining the King's claim to\nrepresent the Palestinians. Equally abortive was Amman's\nAmerican-approved West Bank development plan, intended to\nhold off Palestinian immigration while reestablishing\nJordanian influence. By 1988, when the King dramatically\nsevered his remaining administrative and financial ties to the\nterritories (greatly damaging both economies in the process),\nHashemite influence among the Palestinians had sunk to a\nlow ebb.\nNow, as a consequence of the Gulf War, Jordan has been\npresented once more as an \"option,\" albeit a rather passive one.\nHaving gained Israeli assent by not doing the worst during the\nGulf War, and American support for rejoining the winner's\nAMERICAN POLICY AND PALESTINIAN SELF-GOVERNMENT 99\ncircle, the King has a further advantage as he enters\nnegotiations—the Camp David Accords. Jordan can rely on the\nIsraelis to insist that the Self-Government be negotiated to\nresemble the Camp David autonomy framework which had\nJordan \"written in\" at four points: (1) to serve as the delegation\n(in tandem with Palestinian participants \"as agreed\")\nnegotiating the powers of the self-governing authority; (2) to\nnegotiate with Israel on a \"final status\" and a Peace Treaty; (3)\nto participate in security arrangements, both externally with\nIsrael and through a liaison with the \"strong local police\nforce\"; and (4) to be part of the committee dealing with \"the\nmodalities of admission of persons displaced from the West\nBank and Gaza in 1967\" and other matters.\nThus King Hussein is highly advantaged without having to\nlift too many fingers. The Syrians, by attending a peace\nconference, allow him to go forward; the Palestinians, by\njoining his delegation, grant him legitimacy once more in\nPalestinian affairs. The King can let the Palestinians negotiate\nand compromise on the hard points while relying on Israel to\ninsist that Jordan be given a key role in the workings of the\nSelf-Government. (It bears noting, for example, that the lengthy\nIsraeli-Jordanian experience in controlling border raids and\nterrorism will be an important asset in the security area.)\nTo sum up, Jordan can gain a practical role in the West\nBank once more as part of an agreement that controls\nPalestinian nationalism but does not require the King to offend\nPalestinian sensibilities in the course of the negotiations.\nPalestinian Self-Government under these circumstances fits\nwell what one long time observer of Hussein called his\nsurvival strategy: \"no risks; no heroic initiatives. If possible—\nupset nobody: If a party must be upset, upset that which is least\ndangerous now. .. . If there remains no way to survive but\nfight—fight brutally hard.\"13\nA further advantage of the current diplomatic configuration\nis that Jordan's role can be rather passive. But while the King\nwill certainly not put himself at odds with the Palestinians\nearly on, there are two other considerations that may (or\nshould) make him more active. First, an early failure of the\nnegotiations, especially over symbolic issues such as\n13Uriel Dann, op. tit.\n100 PALESTINIAN SELF-GOVERNMENT\nJerusalem, will set Jordan back when the country desperately\nneeds calm and economic assistance to recover from the Gulf\nWar's dislocations—including 250,000 new Palestinian\nrefugees from the Gulf.14 Second, the King's longer term\ninterest lies in an agreement on final status that grants Jordan\nsovereignty either immediately or through a guaranteed\nfusion with a Palestinian entity. The worst outcome for the\nKing would be a self-government that truly does turn into an\nindependent Palestinian state—which then, from a position of\nrelative strength, negotiates a confederation with Hashemite\nJordan on its own terms or encourages a revolution against\nhim. For reasons of his own dignity and a desire to show the\nPalestinians once and for all that their best choice lies with\nJordan as senior partner, Hussein will want a speedy\ncommencement of final status talks.\nISRAELI CHOICES\nThe Palestinians and the Jordanians may find themselves\nface-to-face with self-government by force of circumstance, but\nfor Israel the matter is different. The self-government proposal\nwas essentially invented by Israel. Now the issue is how far\nthe Jewish state is prepared to go in defining it.\nYitzhak Shamir and his coalition are currently in a strong\nposition. The Gulf War greatly diminished Israel's most\ndangerous short-term military threat—a combined Iraqi\u0002Syrian attack on its eastern front—at very small cost to Israel\nitself. The Soviet Jewish immigrants are coming. And the\nSyrian interest in negotiation, for whatever reason, gives\nShamir an opportunity to blunt the threat from Damascus.\nSimultaneously, Israel is only committed to negotiate\nPalestinian self-government in Judea, Samaria and the Gaza\nDistrict but not to leave these territories.\nThese are the potential rewards of Israel's current situation.\nIf they come to pass they will go far to consolidate a secure\nJewish state in its historic homeland. Palestinian self\u00021\n ^Jordan's officials describe the exodus as larger than that of 1967 and\nmore harmful for the future—since no more remittances from the Gulf\ncan be expected. See Mideast Mirror, August 14, 1991. See also Ann M.\nLesch, \"Palestinians in Kuwait,\" Journal of Palestine Studies, Volume XX,\nNo. 4, Summer 1991.\nAMERICAN POLICY AND PALESTINIAN SELF-GOVERNMENT 101\ngovernment is therefore a way to \"square\" the circle of\nindecision that has afflicted Israel ever since the tremendous\nvictories of 1967.\nIn a perfect world, most Israelis would prefer to have their\nstate incorporate all the land west of the river. Few of any\npolitical persuasion believe that a return to the 1967 lines, even\nunder peace, would be safe. Israelis are split on whether to\ntrade \"land for peace\" or how much; but if they would do so,\nthe King of Jordan is the preferred partner. A solid Israeli\nmajority opposes a Palestinian state and the PLO is widely\nabhorred.\nThe intifadah, and then the Gulf War, had a paradoxical\neffect on those long-held Israeli positions. On one level, the\npersonal level, the Israelis would rather be separate and distant\nfrom a Palestinian people many no longer trust in any\ncapacity. But on another level, the majority stance against the\nestablishment of a Palestinian (or even Jordanian) sovereignty\nany time soon in the territories was reinforced by Palestinian\nsupport for Saddam and by the mounting violence carried by\nPalestinians into pre-1967 Israel. And the Russian immigration\nhas bolstered Israeli confidence that its demographic survival\nis well in hand and that it can dispense with the services of\nPalestinian laborers.\nLikud's long held position that it would be unsafe (as well as\nmorally and ideologically wrong) to give up the territories has\nthus been strengthened by recent events. But the drive to\nincorporate these territories was blunted long ago by fear that\nsuch a large influx of Arab citizens would turn Israel into a\nbinational state. Today the idea of giving the Palestinians in\nthe territories a choice of Israeli citizenship (a notion found in\nBegin's own autonomy proposal) has few takers, even in the\nLikud.\nThe conviction that Israel must control the territories but not\nabsorb its inhabitants crosses party lines. Despite their long\u0002standing differences over whether a territorial compromise\nmight be acceptable, both Likud and Labour agree that in the\nabsence of such a choice, Israel's objective is to hold on at\nminimal cost. While Shimon Peres as Prime Minister actively\nsought out a peace process, convinced that time was not\nentirely on Israel's side largely because of the corrupting\nconsequences of ruling over a rebellious population, Yitzhak\n102 PALESTINIAN SELF-GOVERNMENT\nShamir was content to wait, as Dayan once said of Egypt, for\nthe telephone to ring.\nIt did ring for Dayan in 1973, when instead of bringing a\ncall announcing Egypt's diplomatic capitulation it was the\nYom Kippur War on the other line; Shamir was similarly\nshaken in 1987 when the intifadah burst the illusion that the\nPalestinians were reconciled to a status quo moving steadily\nagainst them. The Unity Government was soon forced to\nsolicit, shape and sometimes reject American diplomatic\nefforts to restart the peace process. But any search for ways to\nrelieve Israel of responsibility for the Arab populations while\nnot jeopardizing Israeli military control or right to settle could\nonly lead to autonomy. Significantly, it was Rabin of the\nLabour Party who advocated a revival of autonomy even before\nShamir.\nIsrael's interest in Palestinian Self-Government therefore\ngoes deeper than the merely tactical or a desire to stall for time\nwhile the territories and their people are \"absorbed.\" It does\noffer what Jabotinsky originally conceived: a way to deal with\na \"national minority\" without destroying Israeli democracy or\nthreatening the Jewish majority. And it fulfills the strictures of\nMoshe Dayan: to leave the Arabs alone as much as possible\nwhile sustaining a Jewish presence and military control in the\narea.\nIsrael's choice, however, is not just whether to advance the\nconcept of Palestinian Self-Government but how to define its\nparticulars. And it is here that the risks begin. These are both\nimmediate and long term because they inevitably mean a loss\nof Israel's current control and imply a further loss as time goes\non. The 1979-82 negotiations exposed these risks in three basic\ncategories.\nFirst, security dilemmas: It is possible for Israel to satisfy its\nexternal defense requirements in the territories (e.g. thwarting\nattack from Jordan or Syria) with an unobtrusive force. But\neven advances in technology will not eliminate the need for\nsome defensive depth, which would entail demilitarization\nand control of certain areas. Much more problematical will be\ncontrol of terrorism and the retention of Israeli intelligence\nassets. Security for external defense, the safety of settlers and\nthe prevention of terrorism will require maximum cooperation\nwith the Palestinians and the Jordanians—the \"enemies\" of\nthe past.\nAMERICAN POLICY AND PALESTINIAN SELF-GOVERNMENT 103\nSimultaneously, the Israelis will be looking to retain their\ncapacity for unilateral action should such cooperation not be\nforthcoming. This is bound up with the otherwise legalistic\u0002sounding argument over the \"source\" of authority for the\nactions of the Self-Government. If that source is not the Israeli\nmilitary governor (even if his Administration is\n\"withdrawn\") but rather the Agreement itself or a Committee,\nthen Israel will be spelling out rather intrusive procedures to\ncontrol terrorism. This would be especially important when it\ncomes to the settlements, because the settlers represent not only\nan ideological imperative for a Likud government but also a\nbroader idea: that Jews should be safe wherever they live in the\nLand of Israel.\nSecond, political evolution: Once the Palestinians develop a\nfunctioning Self-Government, legitimized by elections and\ninternational support, it will be more difficult for Israel to resist\nthe inevitable call for self-determination or at the least, a\nbroadening set of powers that amount to Palestinian\nsovereignty. The transitional \"Self-Government\" negotiated by\nIsrael would ironically become an Israeli Mandate for the\nemerging Arab state of Palestine. Aryeh Shalev, a former\nIsraeli Military Governor of Judea and Samaria wrote in 1980\nthat, \"the political will of the population under autonomy will\nhave great influence on its future; and their desire is for an\nindependent national entity.\"15 The result he feared would be\na state extracted from Israeli control under extreme local and\ninternational pressure.\nThird, the political environment or \"linkage\": Israel faced this\nproblem with Egypt and, as shown earlier, resisted any\nconnection between her bilateral peace and the autonomy\nnegotiations only to reverse course as the date for withdrawal\nfrom Sinai approached. Thus far, the Israelis have been content\nto suggest that the two tracks (Israel-Arab states; Israel\u0002Palestinians) progress simultaneously but not that one cannot\nhappen without the other. The interim nature of the\nPalestinian Self-Government, however, contrasts with the\npermanent nature of the peace treaties Israel will seek\nimmediately with the other Arab states. If an agreement on\nl^See Aryeh Shalev, \"Autonomy: Problems and Possible Solutions,\"\nJerusalem Quarterly No. 15, Spring 1980, p. 14. Shalev also wrote a much\nlarger study in Hebrew, published by Center for Strategic Studies of Tel\nAviv University in 1979.\n104 PALESTINIAN SELF-GOVERNMENT\nSelf-Government is reached, but the Israeli-Syrian negotiations\nfail, will the Syrians be able to veto it? And if the Israeli-Syrian\nnegotiations succeed, but no agreement is reached on Self\u0002Government, will the Palestinians be able to veto the bilateral\naccords?\nOverall, the danger for Israel can be expressed this way:\nPalestinian Self-Government could mean a loss of tangible\ncontrol without much of a reduction in Palestinian (or Arab)\nhostility. At this point, Israel seems prepared to run that risk in\nthe belief that improved relations with other Arab states and a\n\"safe\" Self-Government can be attained. The Israelis, like their\nnegotiating counterparts, will be judging the details of the Self\u0002Government against their longer-term objectives which still\nremain: presence in the territories, security guarantees and no\nindependent Palestinian state.\nIn 1989, the then Unity Government was forced to consider\nwhere a renewed negotiation might take Israel—this time with\nthe Palestinians. The resulting Shamir-Rabin plan reserved to\nIsrael exclusive power in three areas: foreign policy, security\nand jurisdiction over Israeli citizens. Shamir's current coalition\nreaffirmed the \"Peace Plan\" when it took office. There is every\nreason to believe that these three points remain Israel's\nminimum—along with the exclusion of the city of Jerusalem\nfrom the jurisdiction of the Palestinian Self-Government.\nVin LAND AND WATER,\nSECURITY AND PEACE\nThis analysis reveals many overlapping Palestinian,\nJordanian and Israeli interests in Self-Government. The\nPalestinians may obtain what they cannot obtain otherwise:\nthe end of military government, a way to halt Israeli\nencroachment and a chance to foster internationally\nrecognized, fairly elected representatives. The Israelis can\nshed responsibility for the Palestinian population's security\nand prosperity, without losing their presence in the areas or\njeopardizing their own security. The Jordanians can reenter\nthe politics of the Palestinian problem on terms that give them\nan important and recognized role they do not now possess.\nOverall, then, Self-Government offers major advantages over\nthe status quo.\nThe United States would be wise, however, to recognize that\nas in the earlier negotiations the parties are ultimately\nmotivated by incompatible objectives. Though they will enter\ninto negotiations by accepting that final status cannot be\nguaranteed in advance, once the process is in motion they will\nnegotiate in the hopes of doing just that, through the struggle\nover the details of Self-Government. The Palestinians will\npursue the symbols and powers of sovereignty, leading to a\nPalestinian state; the Jordanians, a confederal solution; Israel,\neither a prolongation of the interim arrangement or a three\u0002way confederation. To achieve anything at all, American\ndiplomats will have to act as a kind of conscience,\nemphasizing the interim nature of the negotiations and\nreminding the parties of the pragmatic advantages of\nchanging the status quo.\n105\n106 PALESTINIAN SELF-GOVERNMENT\nThere may even be rapid progress (as happened earlier) on\nelections (except for the role of East Jerusalem's Arabs), the size\nof the Self-Government and the list of minimal exclusive\npowers—the Israeli list of functions. But sooner or later, neither\nthe appeal to conscience nor diplomatic ingenuity will avoid\nthe hardest tests: the basic areas where agreement makes the\nentire Self-Government work and where disagreement makes\neven other achievements irrelevant.\nAt the end of 1980 and certainly by the spring of 1982,\nAmerican negotiators had reduced the issues to five: (1) the\nsource of authority; (2) ownership of land and water resources;\n(3) security; (4) settlements; and (5) Jerusalem. Of these, the\n\"source of authority\" problem will resolve itself if the parties\ncan agree on everything else because in the end their\nagreement will be the real source of authority for Palestinian\nSelf-Government. On the other side, Jerusalem is pre\u0002eminently a final status issue. Its exclusion from the\njurisdiction of Palestinian Self-Government, however, will not\ndiminish the desire of the East Jerusalem Arabs themselves to\ncast their future with Palestinian, not Israeli, politics. Again,\nagreement on other matters will make a compromise solution\nmore palatable if it enables the Palestinians to do this while the\nIsraelis reaffirm their sovereignty. As experience attests, if\nJerusalem becomes the first issue on the agenda, then hardly\nanything will happen.\nThe problems of the source of authority and Jerusalem will\n\"break\" a Self-Government negotiation only if the parties wish\nto do so. But agreement on those issues alone will not make a\ndeal. For the real tests of Self-Government lie in two of the three\nremaining areas: control of land and water resources and\nsecurity. And the third area—Jewish settlement activity—is\nreally symbolic of both.\n\"Land-water\" and \"security\" are really two sides of the\nsame coin: the sense of safety for both Israelis and Palestinians.\nSafety consists of having (1) a \"title,\" a right to be there and (2)\nphysical safety, whether as individuals, as a community, or as\na state.\nThe Israeli settlements are symptomatic of this basic\nproblem. They constitute an Israeli title to the Land of Israel\nand, at least to some strategists, a guarantee that a threatening\nPalestinian \"entity\" can never be created. For the Palestinians,\nof course, the settlements show Israel's determination to\nLAND AND WATER, SECURITY AND PEACE 107\nremain whether wanted or not, a constant encroachment that\nthreatens the Palestinian title. The Israelis are unlikely to trade\nanything on settlements outside of an overall agreement on\nSelf-Government. And the Palestinians will never accept a Self\u0002Government that does not give them some way to restrict\nsettlements.\nAs noted, however, the settlements are really a \"subset\" of\nthe issue of communal safety and control. Agreement on Self\u0002Government (and the settlements problem) is therefore more\nlikely to be found if the diplomats concentrate quickly on the\nkey issues of \"land-water\" and \"security.\" In each case, the\nU.S. can play a very important role in easing a way to solution.\nTo repeat, if solutions are not found in these matters, the others\nwill be insoluble as well.\nLAND AND WATER\nThe land and water issue can be understood only in the\ncontext of the geographic and demographic realities now\nobtaining in the West Bank and Gaza.\nSome 80 percent of the West Bank's 2,351 square miles is\nmountainous country, much of it barren; nearly half, the\neastern part, is desert or semi-desert; and only 30 percent can\nbe described as agricultural land. The yields of this land are\nlow because the soil is stony and much of the farming is\nterraced on slopes. About 10 percent of the entire area (135,000\nacres) is good farming country.\nWater is scarce. The Jordan River's flow is already\ndiminished by both Jordan and Israel, leaving little for the\nWest Bank. Some 60 percent of the 432 Arab villages depend\non rain water held in cisterns for household and other use.\nLittle land is therefore irrigated. There are flows from part of\nthe territory into the underground aquifers used by Israel's\ndensely populated coastal plain. According to one source, these\nwaters provide 17-19 percent of Israel's water supply and sustain\nthe balance in the aquifer between fresh and saline sea water\noff the coast.1\n'Report of JCSS Study Group, The West Bank and Gaza: Israel's Options for\nPeace, Tel Aviv, Tel Aviv University Press, 1989, p. 200. See also Meron\nBenvenisti and Shlomo Khayat, The West Bank and Gaza Atlas, Western\nPress, 1980, pp. 113-114, 118. And David Kahan, Agriculture and Water\n108 PALESTINIAN SELF-GOVERNMENT\nThe West Bank's farmland and water are thus severely\nlimited, even if some way were found to use more of the water\nthat otherwise flows to the coastal plain. As for other resources,\nthe territory holds only large quantities of limestone rock and\nminerals from the Dead Sea, already being exploited by Israel\nfrom her coast within the \"Green Line,\" and by Jordan.\nPopulation studies indicate that the Palestinian inhabitants\nnumber over 900,000, of whom 100,000 still live in refugee\ncamps. The annual increase exceeds three percent and the\nhistoric outmigration (emigration) from the area to the Gulf\nand elsewhere has now largely ceased. People between the\nages of 20-49 exceed 30 percent of the population. Half of all the\ninhabitants are urban; only 26 percent work in agriculture,\nversus 60 percent when the Israelis took over. And probably\nhalf the population depends—or depended, before the\nintifadah—largely on earnings from Israel.\nGaza, separated from the West Bank by a 26 mile portion of\nIsrael's Negev desert, covers 151 square miles along the coast. It\nis a semi-arid plain with sufficient rain in the northern sector\nto support agriculture. About half the Gaza Strip is being\ncultivated with extensive irrigation: the crops are citrus and\nmarket gardens. The water supplies—drawing from the Israeli\naquifer—are marginal at best, and becoming saline because of\nwell overpumping. Gaza's Arab population, 354,000 according\nto the Israeli census of 1967, probably exceeds 660,000. Half the\npeople still live in refugee camps and their birth rate is very\nhigh: 3.4 percent a year, much higher than the West Bank,\nwhile the emigration rate is much lower. Before the intifadah,\n46 percent of the labor force worked in Israel. Doubtless, most of\nthe employed Gazans draw (or drew) their income from\nIsrael.*\nBearing upon these facts are Jewish and Arab immigration\npressures. Up to a million Soviet Jews are expected in Israel\nResources of the West Bank and Gaza (1967-1987) (Boulder: Westview Press,\n1987).\n'The demographics and economics of the territories and their place in\nthe peace process are discussed at length in Patrick Clawson and Howard\nRosen, The Economic Consequences of Peace for Israel, the Palestinians and\nJordan, (Washington D.C.: The Washington Institute for Near East\nPolicy, 1991).\nLAND AND WATER, SECURITY AND PEACE 109\nover the next few years. Today, 80 percent of Israel's population\nis Jewish (including Jerusalem). That proportion drops to 60\npercent if the West Bank and Gaza are included. A 1988 study\nestimated that because of higher Arab birth rates (34.2 per\nthousand versus 13.1 per thousand for Jews) to keep the Jewish\nproportion of the whole at 60 percent by the year 2000, 700,000\nJewish immigrants would be needed over the next ten years.3\nSoviet immigration, then, goes a long way toward easing\nIsrael's demographic worries, but does not end them.\nThe Palestinians, in addition to their refugees from the\nwars of 1948 and 1967, are in the midst of receiving another\nwave from the Gulf States. Some 250,000 have already arrived\nin Jordan. Both Jordan and various Palestinians have voiced\nthe view that some population balance is a key to sustaining an\nArab hold on the West Bank and Gaza. Thus \"the right to\nreturn\" to these areas will be of fundamental importance to a\nPalestinian self-government. The Palestinians already see this\nin relationship to Jewish settlements and the Israelis no doubt\nwill hardly agree to such a return if Jewish settlements are to\nbe menaced.\nThese facts indicate the following conclusions:\n1) The West Bank and Gaza contain a young, rapidly\ngrowing population.\n2) Their land and water supplies are very limited and\nother natural resources are scant.\n3) The population is increasingly urban.\n4) Its income depends largely on the Israeli economy,\nthere being a very small agricultural base to begin with\nand very little industry or natural resources.\n5) The West Bank and Gaza have little in common, are\nphysically separated and most importantly have very\ndifferent ratios of settled population to refugees, Gaza\ncontaining many more people still living in camps.\nA Palestinian self-government (autonomy) for these areas\nwould therefore need to foster large scale economic\ndevelopment if it were to attempt to improve the material\ncondition of the population.\nAs an American participant in the earlier autonomy\nnegotiations pointed out, \"it would be difficult to imagine how\n3\nJCSS study, op. cit., p. 204.\n110 PALESTINIAN SELF-GOVERNMENT\nthe Palestinian self-governing authority could have\nmeaningful responsibility in any field-industry, commerce,\nschools, agriculture, health—if it did not have authority over\nland, resources and water.\"4 It is equally difficult, however, to\nsee that authority vested exclusively in the Palestinians, not\nonly because of Israeli objections but for purely practical\nreasons. A successful economic plan will require the (1)\ncooperation of Israel and Jordan and (2) additional foreign\nassistance, including regional arrangements on water.\nThe case for a shared and balanced power over land and\nwater will clearly affect Jewish settlements. New and even\nexpanded settlements will depend in large measure on the\ndisposition of land, both public and private, and water\nresources, over which the Palestinian Self-Government must\nand will have a say.5 A mutual veto over these resources as part\n4Alan J. Kreczko, \"Support Reagan's Initiative,\" Foreign Policy, Winter\n1982-83, p. 150.\nland ownership system in the territories is far too complex to\ncapture here. A number of factors including Ottoman era tax and\nconscription policies, illiteracy and fear, have left land-holding records\nincomplete or misleading. The British in their time established a\nregister which remained during the Jordanian period. For the\nhistorical background, see Kenneth W. Stein, The Land Question in\nPalestine, 1917-1939, (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press,\n1984). After the Israeli Supreme Court invalidated an Israeli settlement,\nEilon Moreh, built on private property confiscated for security reasons, an\nIsraeli survey found that only half the land was \"settled\" legally, i.e.\nunder legal title. The Israeli Military Government claims title to public\nlands (titled or untitled) and has an appeals process for those who have\nprivate claims. Clearly this land, plus land vacated by the withdrawal of\nIsraeli military forces, would be logical patrimony of the Palestinian\nSelf-Government. See Benvenisti and Khayat, op. at.; also Plea Albeck,\n\"The Use of State Owned Land in Judea and Samaria for Jewish\nSettlement,\" Law and Legislation in Israel No. 15, March 1984. See also\nWilliam V. O'Brien Law and Morality in Israel's War with the PLO, (New\nYork and London: Routledge, 1991), pp. 228-30 for Israel's not entirely\ncoherent legal approach to the territories under military rule. For the\nPalestinian perspective, see \"Urban Planning in the West Bank under\nMilitary Occupation,\" Summary Report, June 1991, by Anthony Coons for\nAl-Haq, the West Bank affiliate of the International Commission of\nJurists. See also The Rule of Law in the Areas Administered by Israel, Israel\nBranch of the International Commission of Jurists, 1981.\nLAND AND WATER, SECURITY AND PEACE 111\nof an overall agreement is more likely to bring a halt to new\nIsraeli settlements than anything else.\nThus Israeli-Palestinian agreement on land and water\nshould be set in a regional framework that includes not only\nJordan but multilateral cooperation for both economic and\npolitical reasons. The United States is uniquely placed to\nfacilitate the basic compromise by helping to make possible the\nexternal contribution that would enlarge the resources\navailable to everyone.\nSECURITY\n\"Security\" broadly defined is the other serious test of\nwhether Palestinian Self-Government can work. In the\nterritories, security has three dimensions: defense against\nexternal attack, terrorism and crime. For both Israel and the\nPalestinians, communal and personal safety are at stake. The\ndifficulties are compounded by differing definitions of\nterrorism and by the intelligence activities of the Israeli\nMilitary Administration, including paid informants.\nAs with land and water, the geopolitics of the territories\nplay a major role in the security analysis. The map on page 94\nshows how the terrain affects Israel's pre-1967 areas, including\nthe strategic \"down side\" of the Samarian mountains as they\nslope toward Israel's narrow coastal plain. As noted earlier, the\nwater resources of this area have also taken on a security\ndimension.6\nThe real issue of external defense, however, is the role of\nthe territories in Israel's overall military strategy. Two aspects\ndrawn from the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict are\nparamount: first, the territories might be used to launch an\narmored attack intended to split pre-1967 Israel in two at its\n^Some Israeli analysts believe Israel should insist on annexing a narrow\nstrip in the Samarian foothills, in some places no more than six or\nseven meters, that would cover the main drains into the aquifer so as to\n\"limit the possibility of acute friction over water resources.\" See Ze'ev\nSchiff, Security for Peace: Israel's Minimum Security Requirements in\nNegotiations with the Palestinians, (Washington D.C.: The Washington\nInstitute for Near East Policy, Policy Paper No. 15, 1989), p. 24.

Stahl, 1991.\nLAND AND WATER, SECURITY AND PEACE 113\nnarrowest point; second, Israeli mobilization on the coastal\nplain could be disrupted by artillery or rocket attack from the\nWest Bank. Against this, various Israeli military analysts have\nconcluded that \"full demilitarization, Israeli warning stations\nin the area and Israeli control of some of the areas, such as the\nJordan Valley and Ma'ale Adumim\" would be sufficient.7\nAnd it can be argued that holding on to the Arab population\ncenters could actually weaken Israel in time of conflict\nbecause scarce forces would have to be committed to restrain a\nhostile population.\nFollowing the Gulf War, a reappraisal of Israel's deterrent\nstrategy is underway and the early returns are predictably\nmixed. Clearly, Israel's mobilization areas can be disrupted by\nlong-range missile fire even if Israel retains the territories. Just\nas clearly, territory does play a role in giving the defender\ntime and depth in a war where technology far extends the\nbattlefield.8\nIt is possible to imagine various and quite elaborate\narrangements that would minimize Israel's security presence\nwhile maximizing her early warning capabilities. These\ninclude satellite capabilities Israel cannot now afford; warning\nsensors; troop developments along the Eastern slopes of the\nWest Bank and the Jordan Valley (where few Palestinians\nlive); electronic warning stations; anti-aircraft missiles; and\nanti-missile missiles.9 An exclusive Israeli control over\nexternal security is therefore quite feasible without a\ncontinuing massive intrusion on the Palestinians. But the\nessential point in external defense is always the external threat.\nAnd for Israel that means the power of the so-called Arab\nEastern Front—potentially Syria, Jordan, Iraq and Saudi\nArabia.\nThe defeat of Iraq in the Gulf War, as even the Syrians\nadmit, dramatically weakened what had become a semi\u0002cooperative Eastern Front against Israel. Before the war, Jordan\nin particular, while careful not to violate Israeli \"red-lines\" by\n'See for example, former Chief of Staff Mordechai Gur in Ha'aretz, June\n12-13, 1988.\n8Ze'ev Schiff, \"Israel after the War,\" Foreign Affairs, Spring 1991, pp. 19-33.\n^See Schiff, op. cit., pp. 55-57.\n114 PALESTINIAN SELF-GOVERNMENT\nallowing Iraqi forces into Jordan itself, had developed\nimportant intelligence and other exchanges with the Iraqis. A\ncoordinated air defense system was also implicit in the\ndeployments of Jordanian, Iraqi and Syrian capabilities.\nWhile the Eastern Front is a far less ominous threat for\nnow, the Israelis will continue to plan for that possibility.10\nMuch depends not only on the course of Syrian arms\nacquistions, but also on the recovery of Iraq. In any event, for\nthe West Bank to become a battleground would constitute a\ndisaster for both Israel and the Palestinians.\nFrom the foregoing a singular conclusion can be drawn.\nIsrael's minimal security requirements in the West Bank for\nexternal defense will be heavily influenced by the potential\nthreat of the Eastern Front. Or to put it another way, the\nparticipation of Jordan in the security arrangements for the\nterritories and the state of Israeli-Syrian relations will have a\nmajor influence on Israeli security flexibility.\nThe American role in these security arrangements can be\nquite significant. Three elements are likely to be crucial. One\nwill concern U.S.-Israel intelligence exchanges, such as access\nto satellite surveillance; a second will be a monitoring\nfunction. The third, however, will be more important than all\nthe rest. That is the American role as the \"partner\" not only to\nthe Self-Government agreement but to the other track—the\noverall strategic relationship between Israel and the other Arab\nstates. A Palestinian Self-Government functioning in the\nshadow of Syrian or Gulf Arab hostility will have a much\nrougher go than one functioning in the context of peaceful\nrelations—even a cold peace—between the Arab states and\nIsrael.\nThe other critical aspects of security are internal. Public\norder—the policeman on the beat—will assuredly be a main\nresponsibility of the Palestinian Self-Government. Just as\nassuredly, at least at the start, it will have to rely on Jordanian\n(and Israeli) cooperation to work. The more difficult issue\nconcerns not street crime but terrorism.\nIt is hard to avoid the conclusion that no outside party can\nsubstitute for a measure of trust in this area among Israel,\nJordan and the Palestinian Self-Government. This is a very\u0002circular argument, it being clear already that if such trust were\nid. The Syrians still mount a powerful force on their own.\nLAND AND WATER, SECURITY AND PEACE 115\npossible much of the heat would have already gone out of the\nentire conflict. Moreover, the Palestinians themselves have\nbeen badly hurt by internecine warfare. More than one-third\nof those slain during the intifadah have been victims of fellow\nArabs. Even at full strength, the Israeli Military Government\nhas not been able to impose absolute order or to assure total\nsafety for those suspected rightly or wrongly of being\ninformants. The continued presence of Israeli settlers will not\nmake the task of public order any easier.\nTerrorism is therefore likely to continue despite everyone's\nbest efforts, even under Palestinian Self-Government. The issue\nis whether such terrorism, defined as attacks on civilians, will\nfind in the Self-Government a source of support, refuge and\nimmunity. \"Trust\" in this case will be the confidence of the\nparties that the Self-Government will act to suppress terrorism\nand that the Israelis will not use it as an excuse to run\nroughshod over Palestinian authority. Above all, terrorism will\nhave to be viewed by most of the Palestinian population as a\nreal threat to their interests.\nIn the establishment of such trust, tacit \"red-lines\" among\nthe parties will have to be created and understood, and the\nUnited States will be called upon sooner or later to \"vouch\" for\nthese lines. In the event of a crisis, Washington's impartial\njudgement will count heavily as to whether the parties\ninvolved upheld their commitments. A Palestinian Self\u0002Government that cannot prevent its opponents from acting to\nharm its own interests will fail. Israel should have every\ninterest in making sure that the Self-Government succeed\nwithout Israeli intervention, as should Jordan. But no one can\nexpect \"self-policing\" to work perfectly at the outset of what will\nbe a controversial agreement. This is where U.S. support and\ngood offices will be most useful.\nCONCLUSION: THE COUNSEL OF IMPERFECTION\nChurchill once said that \"the maxim—nothing avails but\nperfection—spells paralysis.\" The American policymaker in\nsearch of the perfect solution to the Palestinian problem—or the\nArab-Israeli conflict—will find only paralysis. The parties are\nfaced instead with the choice of doing better than the status quo\nor hoping that something better will turn up to relieve them of\nthe necessity for compromise.\n116 PALESTINIAN SELF-GOVERNMENT\nPalestinian Self-Government (Autonomy) is a counsel of\nimperfection. By nature, imperfections limit, yet within those\nlimits much can be achieved. Given the ferocious antagonisms\nof the Arab-Israeli conflict, perhaps the first argument in favor\nof Palestinian \"Self-Government is the negative: what it\nprevents.\nIn the Arab-Israeli conflict there are no truly new ideas,\nonly good ones and bad ones—depending on one's point of\nview. Palestinian Self-Government as an interim solution can\nbe seen as a good idea if each side sees it as a necessary\nobstacle to the other's aspirations. The Palestinians' only hope\nis to convert Self-Government into the strategic ally they lack.\nIf the Palestinians see it as the best way available to prevent\nIsraeli annexation they will swallow the inevitable limitations\nit entails. If Israelis see it as the best way available to prevent a\nPalestinian state—or at least the economic and human disaster\nthat would revive demands for such a state—then they will run\nthe risks of fostering limited political institutions in the\nterritories.\nThere is also a strong positive argument for Self\u0002Government, in that it can give each party what it does not\nnow possess: for the Palestinians, the end of Israeli Military\nGovernment, some control over resources, democratic political\ninstitutions, and some help for refugees; for Jordan, a\nrecognized role in West Bank affairs, especially with regard to\nsecurity; for Israel, less responsibility for the Palestinian\npopulation, limited loss of security and a confirmed civilian\npresence; and for all of the parties, a contraction in hostility\nand an expansion of hope.\nThe United States can help all of this come about.\nAmerican policy can remind the parties that differences on\nfinal status can impede interim steps. Washington can work to\nassure a supporting cast: productive Israel-Arab state\nnegotiations to contain those who reject the peacemakers;\nregional arrangements to enlarge water resources and\neconomic exchange; and security agreements that monitor\nperformance and encourage trust. This seems a great deal of\neffort for what is billed as an interim agreement. Yet as the\nalternative to paralysis it offers critical steps down the path at\nLAND AND WATER, SECURITY AND PEACE 117\nthe end of which a lasting solution may be found. Palestinian\nSelf-Government can contribute to the establishment of peace.\nIf the parties are not convinced of this, then Self-Government\nwill continue to be the road not taken. If the parties are\nconvinced, then it will happen and very soon.\n\nAPPENDICES"
