Now the aftermath is helping to fuel a wave of protests over the past two weeks that has left at[least 500 people] dead as the Islamic Republic attempts to regain control.\nFootage seeping out of the country shows mass protests are continuing despite the crackdown. Human-rights-group assessments say security forces have already gunned down hundreds, and possibly thousands, of protesters. PresidentTrumphas repeatedly[threatened to attack Iran] if deadly force is used, and on Tuesday aides are scheduled to brief him on specific measures the U.S. can take to respond to the killings.\nIran’s leaders have weathered similar storms before. This time, the regime is in a far weaker position.\nThe ayatollahs’ rule was shaped by the bloody eight-year war thatSaddam Hussein’sIraq launched in the aftermath of the 1979 Islamic Revolution. The social compact that endured since that trauma was that Iranians would acquiesce to hardship and restrictions in return for a strong state that protects them from foreign attack.\nCopyright ©2026Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

But what military access to the island can't already be negotiated? Plus, the CDC drops several shots from its childhood vaccine recommendations.\n\nSeven dollars a month. That’s the Iranian regime’s offer to its people as the currency plummets, inflation rises, and demonstrations enter their 12th day. Protests continue to grow, spreading to new cities and identifying in chants the source of Iran’s economic failures: the regime.\n\nWhile Ayatollah Ali Khamenei scrounges $7 for the Iranian citizen, he smuggled a billion dollars to Hezbollah in the first 10 months of 2025, according to the U.S. Treasury’s top sanctions official. That’s enough to pay each Lebanese terrorist a monthly salary of more than $1,000. No wonder a popular protest chant is: “Neither Gaza nor Lebanon, my life for Iran.”\n\nCopyright ©2026 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Photo: Bonnie Cash/Pool/EPA/Shutterstock/Leonardo Fernandez Viloria/Reuters\n\nThe protests in Iran are persisting in the face of the regime’s indiscriminate violence. President Trump has vowed to strike Iran for killing protesters; he has also said he wants to have talks. The besieged but cagey mullahs, who have come to fear Mr. Trump’s unpredictable bellicosity, may offer appealing concessions. They may even agree to nuclear inspections, given the West’s and Mr. Trump’s earlier inclination to put the nuclear question above all others. The administration is at its own-designated fork in the road, with any decision carrying momentous ramifications.\n\nProtests have spread to nearly all Iran’s provinces and cities. Even Persians are throwing themselves into a rebellion with a passion and fearlessness that we have seen in the past only from Iran’s ethnic minorities. Molotov cocktails, improvised flamethrowers and other makeshift weapons are being used against the security forces, whose martyrdom the regime hails. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and his henchmen aren’t about to flee to Moscow or the holy city of Najaf, Iraq. They intend to shoot their way out of their predicament. Mr. Khamenei and his followers equate the survival of the Islamic Republic with the survival of Islam itself.\n\nCopyright ©2026 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The protests began peacefully and were recognized as legitimate by the Iranian government. They suddenly turned violent when foreign and domestic terrorist actors entered the scene, so blocking communication among organizers of the rioters and terrorists was an imperative. As those cells are being wrapped up by our intelligence and security agencies, the internet and all communications are slowly being restored.\n\nCopyright ©2026 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Israel&#x27;s defence ministry announced Feb. 28 it had launched a &quot;preemptive strike&quot; on Iran as sirens sounded in Jerusalem and people across the country received phone alerts about an &quot;extremely serious&quot; threat.] A plume of smoke rises following a reported explosion in Tehran on Feb. 28, 2026. Israel&#x27;s defence ministry announced Feb. 28 it had launched a &quot;preemptive strike&quot; on Iran as sirens sounded in Jerusalem and people across the country received phone alerts about an &quot;extremely serious&quot; threat.-/AFP via Getty Images\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The U.S. and Israel launched a major attack on Iran on Saturday, with President Donald Trump calling on the Iranian public to “seize control of your destiny” and rise up against the Islamic leadership that has ruled the nation since 1979.\nSome of the first strikes appeared to hit areas around the offices of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and Iranian media reported strikes nationwide. Smoke could be seen rising from the capital. It wasn’t immediately clear whether the 86-year-old leader was in his offices at the time of the strike.\n“When we are finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take. This will be probably your only chance for generations,” Trump said in a video announcing “major combat operations” were underway. “For many years, you have asked for America’s help, but you never got it.”\nFEATURED VIDEO\n**See live updates.**\n//endIntro\n//pin\n[![Embedded YouTube video]] \nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu echoed that sweeping goal. “Our joint operation will create the conditions for the brave Iranian people to take their fate into their own hands,” Netanyahu said.\nThe strikes opened a stunning new chapter in U.S. intervention in Iran and marked the second time in eight months that the Trump administration has used military force against the Islamic Republic. They also came just weeks after Trump ordered a military operation to capture Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, and bring him and his wife to New York to face federal drug conspiracy charges.\nThe operation also comes as tensions have soared in recent weeks as American warships moved into the region, and Trump said he wanted a deal to constrain Iran’s nuclear program at a moment when the country is struggling at home with growing dissent following nationwide protests.\nAdvertisement\nIran responded as it had been threatening to do for months — first launching a wave of missiles and drones targeting Israel. It followed with strikes targeting U.S. military installations in Bahrain, Kuwait and Qatar. The United Arab Emirates and Iraq shut down their airspace.\nIran’s Foreign Ministry issued a defiant statement, saying that the country “will not hesitate” in its response. In a statement posted on X, the ministry said: “The time has come to defend the homeland and confront the enemy’s military assault.”\nForty people were reported killed at a girls’ school in southern Iran in the Israeli-U.S. strikes, according to Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency. At least 45 others were wounded in the attack in Minab in Iran’s Hormozgan province.\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on reported strike on the school.\nFour people were also killed by an Iranian missile striking a building in Syria’s southern city of Sweida, according to Syrian state television.\nShrapnel from an Iranian missile attack on the capital of the UAE killed one person, state media said.\n## Attack was coordinated between Israel and US\nThe attacks came after weeks of the U.S. military massing forces in the region even as U.S. and Iranian envoys held talks in Switzerland and Oman aimed at finding a diplomatic solution to head off American military operation.\nOman’s Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi, a key mediator in the U.S.-Iran nuclear talks, said in a post on X that he was dismayed that U.S. and Israel moved forward with the operation.\n“Active and serious negotiations have yet again been undermined,” said al-Busaidi, who traveled to Washington on Friday to meet with Vice President JD Vance for talks. “Neither the interests of the United States nor the cause of global peace are well served by this. And I pray for the innocents who will suffer. I urge the United States not to get sucked in further.”\nAdvertisement\nIsrael said the operation was carried out as a “broad, coordinated, and joint operation against the regime” that has been planned for months between the Israeli and U.S. militaries.\nTrump, in justifying the military action, claimed that Iran has continued to develop its nuclear program and plans to develop missiles to reach the U.S.\nHe also acknowledged that there could be American casualties, saying “that often happens in war.”\nIt was a notable call on Americans to brace themselves from a U.S. leader who swept into office on an “America First” platform and vowed to keep out of “forever wars” that had bogged down his recent predecessors.\nTrump’s statement indicated the U.S. was striking for reasons far beyond the nuclear program, listing grievances stretching back to the beginning of the Islamic Republic following a revolution in 1979 that turned Iran from one of America’s closest allies in the Middle East into a fierce foe.\nThe U.S. president said he was aiming to “annihilate” the Iranian navy and destroy regional proxies supported by Tehran.\nHe also called on the Iranian Revolutionary Guard to lay down its arms, pledging that members would be given immunity, while warning they would face “certain death” if they didn’t.\n“They’ve rejected every opportunity to renounce their nuclear ambitions, and we can’t take it anymore,” Trump said.\nTrump had threatened military action — but held off — following Iran’s recent crackdown on protests spurred by economic grievances and evolved into a nationwide, anti-government push against the ruling clerics.\nThe Human Rights Activists News Agency says it confirmed more than 7,000 deaths in the crackdown and that it is investigating thousands more. The government has acknowledged more than 3,000 killed, though it has undercounted or not reported fatalities from past unrest.\nAdvertisement\nIran has said it hasn’t enriched since June, but it has blocked international inspectors from visiting the sites America bombed during a 12-day war then. Satellite photos analyzed by The Associated Press have shown new activity at two of those sites, suggesting Iran is trying to assess and potentially recover material there.\nIran currently has a self-imposed limit on its ballistic missile program, limiting their range to 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles). That puts all the Mideast and some of Eastern Europe in their range. There is no public evidence of Iran seeking to have intercontinental ballistic missiles, though Washington has criticized its space program as potentially allowing it to one day.\nIran had hoped to avert a war, but maintains it has the right to enrich uranium and does not want to discuss other issues, like its long-range missile program or support for armed groups like Hamas and Hezbollah.\nThe strikes could also have a huge impact on global markets, particularly if Iran is able to make the Strait of Hormuz unsafe for commercial traffic. More than 14 million barrels per day of oil passed through the strait in 2025, about a third of total worldwide oil exports transported by sea.\n## Strikes hit targets across Iran\nIranian media reported strikes nationwide. Roads to Khamenei’s compound in downtown Tehran had been shut down by authorities as other blasts rang out across the capital.\nKhamenei has not made a public appearance in recent days and wasn’t immediately seen after. During the 12-day war in June, he was believed to have been taken to a secure location away from his Tehran compound.\nIn Tehran, witnesses heard the first blast by Khamenei’s office. Iranian state television later reported on the explosion, without offering a cause.\nAdvertisement\nMore explosions struck Iran’s capital after Israel said it was attacking the country. Authorities have offered no casualty information from the strikes.\nTargets in the Israeli campaign included Iran’s military, symbols of government and intelligence targets, according to an official briefed on the operation, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss nonpublic information on the attack.\n## Iran retaliates\nHours after the strikes, Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard said it launched a “first wave” of drones and missiles targeting Israel, where a nationwide warning was issued as the military said it was working to intercept incoming Iranian missiles. There was no immediate word on any damage or casualties from the ongoing attack.\nMeanwhile, Bahrain said that a missile attack targeted the U.S. Navy’s 5th Fleet headquarters in the island kingdom. Witnesses heard sirens and explosions in Kuwait, home to U.S. Army Central. Explosions could be also be heard in Qatar.\nIraq and the United Arab Emirates closed their airspace, and sirens sounded in Jordan.\nIraqi officials also reported a drone strike hit a headquarters of the Iran-backed Kataib Hezbollah militia in Iraq, killing two people and wounding three Saturday. The group had earlier threatened to enter the fray should Iran come under attack. An Israeli military official said Israel was not aware of any Israeli strikes on Kataib Hezbollah headquarters in Iraq.\nThe Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen, meanwhile, vowed to resume attacks on Red Sea shipping routes and on Israel, according to two senior Houthi officials. They spoke on condition of anonymity because there was no official announcement from the Houthi leadership.\nU.S. embassies or consulates in Qatar, United Arab Emirates and Israel posted on social media that they told staffers to shelter in place and recommended all Americans “do the same until further notice.”\nAdvertisement\n\\_\\_\\_\nToropin and Madhani reported from Washington and Boak from West Palm Beach, Florida. Associated Press writers Melanie Lidman and Sam Mednick in Tel Aviv, Israel, Qassim Abdul-Zahra in Baghdad, Samy Magdy in Cairo, and Farnoush Amiri in New York contributed to this report.\n\\_\\_\\_\nThis story has been corrected to show that IRNA reported 40 people were killed in the school strike, without specifying students."

Local media reported that missiles were shot down. There was no immediate statement from Iraqi officials or from the U.S.\nIran-backed Iraqi militias had previously threatened to strike targets in the Kurdish region in case of an attack on Iran. Earlier Saturday, a drone strike targeted a headquarters of the Iran-allied Kataib Hezbollah militia southwest of Baghdad, killing two.\nAdvertisement\n## EU calls for restraint and diplomacy\nEuropean Union leaders issued a joint statement Saturday calling for restraint and engaging in regional diplomacy in hopes of “ensuring nuclear safety.”\n“Ensuring nuclear safety and preventing any actions that could further escalate tensions or undermine the global non-proliferation regime is of critical importance,” said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President António Costa. “We call on all parties to exercise maximum restraint, to protect civilians, and to fully respect international law.”\nBoth said that the EU has pushed to resolve critical issues through diplomacy but also has in place “extensive sanctions in response to the actions of Iran’s murderous regime and the Revolutionary Guards.”\nThey said Brussels was working with the EU’s 27 member nations to support the bloc’s citizens in the Middle East.\n## Saudi Arabia condemns Iranian strikes\nSaudi Arabia strongly condemned the Iranian assaults on the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait and Jordan as a breach of their sovereignty.\nThe Kingdom confirmed that it fully stands by those countries and warned of the “dire consequences of continued breach of sovereignty and violating international principles.”\nSaudi Arabia also called on the international community to take measures to confront the Iranian assaults that are “undermining” the stability and security of the region.\n## US and Israeli strikes target sites across Iran\nStrikes on Saturday are targeting a growing list of cities and sites across Iran, according to Iranian state media. Direct strikes on the capital, Tehran, earlier sent plumes of smokes above its skyline, with reports of explosions in or near the major cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Tabriz.\nBlasts were also reported in several western towns as well as around Persian Gulf port cities that are critical to Iran’s major oil trade, including Asaluyeh.\n## France advises its citizens to exercise caution\nFrance, whose military has bases and a regular presence in the Mideast, has called on French citizens in the region to exercise extreme caution.\nAdvertisement\n“A military escalation is underway ... It’s not the time for negotiations. We are in a situation of war,” junior Defense Minister Alice Rufo told France-2 television Saturday, comparing the situation to the 12-day war in June.\n“Our priority is the protection of our citizens and protection of our forces in the region,” she said.\nAsked if French forces were involved in the U.S. and Israeli strikes or targeted in retaliatory strikes, French military spokesperson Col. Guillaume Vernet said: “The French armed forces continuously adapt their posture to threats and implement measures to ensure the surveillance and protection of military installations where French soldiers are deployed.”\nHe would not elaborate.\n“Our military presence guarantees France’s independent assessment of the situation,” he told the AP.\n## Israeli president salutes attacks on Iran\nIsrael’s President Isaac Herzog has welcomed the joint U.S.-Israeli operation against Iran.\nHerzog says he hopes the operation “will bring a historic change and a better future for the whole Middle East and the entire world.”\n## Khamenei’s whereabouts unknown\nIran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei did not make a public appearance in the days before the attack and hasn’t been immediately seen after. During the 12-day war in June, he was believed to have been taken to a secure location away from his Tehran compound.\n## Qatar says it repels second wave of Iranian attacks\nQatar’s Defense Ministry says the military has successfully repelled the second wave of Iranian attacks that targeted several parts of the nation.\nThe Qatari Foreign Ministry condemned the attacks, calling them a “flagrant violation” of its sovereignty. It added that Qatar has been always among the sides calling for a dialogue with Iran.\nThe Foreign Ministry said that the targeting of Qatar by a neighbor “cannot be accepted under any justification or pretext” as the gas-rich Gulf nation has always distanced itself from regional conflicts.\nAdvertisement\n## Syria closes airspace\nSyria’s civil aviation authority announced the closure of airspace in southern Syria Saturday, while a number of airlines, including Lufthansa, Air France, Transavia, Qatar Airways, and Pegasus canceled all flights to Lebanon.\n## Emirates Airlines says flights are disrupted\nEmirates, one of the world’s biggest long-haul airlines, says several of its flights have been affected by the airspace closure in the United Arab Emirates.\nThe carrier is based at Dubai International Airport, the busiest hub for international travel. It says it is working with local officials and adjusting its operations, and it urged passengers to check their flight status online.\nEmirates transported 53.7 million passengers during its last fiscal year. Many of those passengers, like those of fellow regional carriers Qatar Airways and Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways, were transiting the region for destinations elsewhere.\n## US-Israeli attacks are expected to continue, AP told\nA person briefed on the military plans says Saturday’s operation was planned by the U.S. and Israel for months and closely coordinated.\nThe person says the attacks are expected to continue for several days.\nThey spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter with the media.\n———\nBy Sam Mednick in Tel Aviv.\n## Iran says Israeli-US airstrikes kill 5 at girls’ school\nIran on Saturday said Israeli-U.S. airstrikes in southern Iran killed five students at a girls’ school, the first confirmed fatalities in the operation.\nThe state-run IRNA news agency reported the strike happened in Minab in Iran’s Hormozgan province. Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard has a base in the city.\nNeither the U.S. nor Israel has offered any details on the campaign so far.\n## Impact wounds 1 in Israel\nIsrael’s national rescue service MADA said one man was lightly wounded from an impact in northern Israel.\nFire and rescue services said an apartment on the 20th floor of an apartment building suffered a direct hit. It was not clear if it was struck by a missile or debris from an interception.\nAdvertisement\n## Iran confirms attacks on US sites\nIran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard says that in its retaliation against Israel and U.S. attacks on Iran, the military struck several facilities in the region.\nThe Revolutionary Guard said in a statement that in the first phase of retaliation, named “Truthful Promise 4,” Iran’s military struck the command of the U.S. 5th Fleet in Bahrain as well as U.S. bases in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, and military targets in Israel.\nThere have been no reports of damage in these areas apart from one death in the United Arab Emirates.\nThe Guard said Iranian attacks with missiles and drones are continuing and more information will be released later.\n## Bahrain condemns Iranian attack on US fleet\nBahrain’s ambassador in the U.S. says attacks occurred against “sites within the Kingdom,” without giving further details. Writing on X, Abdalla Al-Khalifa said the attacks were a “blatant violation of sovereignty.”\nIran has apparently attacked the U.S. 5th Fleet in Bahrain in response to U.S.-Israeli attacks in Tehran. The Bahraini diplomat said that Bahrain “reserves the right to respond” to attack on its territory.\n## Qatar Airways suspends flights\nQatar Airways says it is temporarily suspending flights at its Doha hub because of the closure of the Gulf nation’s airspace.\nThe airline says it is working with local authorities to support passengers affected by the stoppage, and that it expects delays once flights eventually resume. It did not predict when that might be.\nGovernment-owned Qatar Airways is one of the Middle East’s largest airlines, funneling tens of millions of mostly long-haul passengers through Qatar to destinations on six continents.\n## Iranian missile shrapnel kills 1 in UAE\nShrapnel from an Iranian missile attack on the capital of the United Arab Emirates killed one person Saturday, authorities in Dubai said.\nThe state-run WAM news agency reported the fatality, the first known in the Iranian counterattack after the United States and Israel launched a major airstrike campaign targeting Iran.\nAdvertisement\n## Attacks on Iran risk wider war and higher energy prices\nWithin hours of the joint U.S. and Israeli strike in Iran, Ali Vaez, who directs the Iran Project at the Crisis Group think tank, warned that the war could likely escalate.\nVaez on social media stressed that Iran had been preparing for the conflict and that wider war could break out across the Middle East.\nHe also stressed that the war could lead to higher energy costs, which would undercut one of Trump’s domestic political messages that gasoline prices have been lower since his return to the White House.\n“Iran sits along the Strait of Hormuz, through which roughly a fifth of the world’s oil supply passes,” Vaez posted. “Even limited disruption could spike energy prices, fuel inflation, and rattle global markets.”\n## EU calls Iran a threat to global security\nThe European Union’s top diplomat called the conflict in the Middle East “perilous” and said she was working with Israel and Arab officials to pursue a negotiated peace.\n“Iran’s regime has killed thousands. Its ballistic missile and nuclear programmes, along with support for terror groups, pose a serious threat to global security,” said Kaja Kallas, foreign policy chief of the 27-nation bloc, in a post on social media.\nShe said the EU was evacuating some staff in the region and keeping in place a maritime mission in the Red Sea.\nThe EU recently put fresh sanctions on Iran and leading figures, prompting retaliatory sanctions by Tehran.\n## Turkish Airlines suspends flights\nTurkish Airlines says it is suspending flights to multiple Middle Eastern countries. Flights to Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Iran and Jordan will be suspended till March 2, an official said on X.\nMeanwhile flights to Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, UAE and Oman will suspended till Feb. 28. Further cancellations may be announced, the official said.\n## US 5th Fleet plays important role in securing shipping lanes\nThe U.S. Navy’s 5th Fleet command that host nation Bahrain said was targeted by a missile attack is responsible for securing the shipping lanes around the oil-rich Middle East.\nThose waters include the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea and parts of the Indian Ocean. The region contains three key chokepoints: the Suez Canal and the Bab al-Mandeb on either end of the Red Sea, and the Strait of Hormuz between Iran and Oman.\nIran has repeatedly threatened to shut the strait if attacked. Iranian-allied Houthi rebels in Yemen have said they will resume attacks on shipping routes and on Israel.\nThe extent of the damage on the 5th Fleet headquarters wasn’t immediately clear. The base is located just to the southeast of central Manama, the island nation’s capital.\n## Drone strikes Iran-linked militia HQ in Iraq\nA drone strike Saturday hit a headquarters of the Iran-backed Kataib Hezbollah militia in Iraq, in the Jurf al-Sakhar area southwest of Baghdad, killing at least two people and wounding four others, two militia officials said. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly.\nThere was not immediate comment from the U.S. or Israel.\nPrior to Saturday’s strikes on Iran, the group had threatened to join the fray should Iran be attacked.\nMeanwhile, Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hassan said in a statement that he received a call from his Iranian counterpart, Abbas Araghchi, in while Araghchi said Iran would target U.S. bases in the region out of self-defense.\n“He clarified that these attacks were not targeting the countries involved, but were limited to military sites,” the statement said. It added that Hussein urged deescalation.\n———\nBy Qassim Abdul-Zahra in Baghdad.\n## Israel says Iran was stepping up missile program\nIn a briefing with reporters, a military spokesman said Israel has identified “a sharp acceleration” in Iran’s missile program.\nLt. Col. Nadav Shoshani says Iran was beginning to make dozens of ballistic missiles a month. He also said there had been no significant hits in Israel. He spoke just before noon, roughly four hours after the operation began.\n## Iran confirms response to attacks\nIran’s Supreme National Security Council confirmed its armed forces had “commenced a decisive response to these hostile acts.”\nIn a statement, it warned the Iranian people to travel to areas not included in the zones being targeted and said the government had made “prior arrangements” to ensure the supply of basic necessities.\nSchools and universities were ordered to close while the statement said banks would continue to operate.\nGermany says it was told of Israeli strikes in advance\nThe German government was informed in advance this morning about Israel’s military strikes on Iran, a spokesman said on Saturday.\nGermany is in close consultation with its European partners, the spokesman said. Its crisis management team will meet at noon to discuss Iran.\nThe government urged German citizens in Iran, Israel, and the wider region to register on the official system for citizens abroad and follow the instructions of the local authorities for their own protection.\nThe foreign ministry said it was in “close and constant” contact with the embassies in Iran and Israel, as well as other missions in the region.\n## Iran makes plans with Iraqi militias, sources tell AP\nTwo officials with different Iran-backed militias in Iraq told The Associated Press that a meeting took place two months ago between Iranian officials and allied Iraqi militias to make plans for a response in case Iran was attacked, including distributing tasks among the Iraqi armed groups.\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly.\nOne of the officials said it was decided that the response would target U.S. forces and interests in Iraq’s semi-autonomous northern Kurdish region and in neighboring Jordan.\nU.S. troops have vacated bases where they were previously stationed in Iraq in areas under the control of the central government in Baghdad. This followed an agreement to end the military mission in Iraq of an American-led coalition fighting the Islamic State, but U.S. forces remain in the Kurdish region.\nOne of the most prominent Iraqi militias, Kataib Hezbollah, on Thursday issued a public statement urging its fighters to “be prepared to engage in a war of attrition that may be prolonged and exceed the expectations of the U.S. administration.”\nIt also issued a warning to the Kurdish regional government in Iraq “against collaborating with hostile foreign forces” that “could threaten its security and future.”\n———\nBy Qassim Abdul-Aahra in Baghdad.\n## Israeli media show images of damaged building\nIsraeli media showed images of damage to an apartment building in northern Israel, reportedly from impact with parts of an interceptor.\nIsraeli police said shrapnel fell in multiple sites. Rescue services said there were no known injuries from the missile barrages launched on all parts of the country.\n## Israel warns Iranians near military sites to evacuate\nThe Israeli military issued a warning in Persian for the immediate evacuation of areas near weapons production and military facilities in Iran.\n“Your presence in these locations puts your lives at risk,” the military said on its Persian-language X account.\n## Iran ‘will not hesitate’ to respond\nIran’s Foreign Ministry responded to the joint strikes Saturday, saying that the country “will not hesitate” in its response to the renewed military aggression.\n“The time has come to defend the homeland and confront the enemy’s military assault,” the foreign ministry posted in a statement on X. “Just as we were prepared for negotiations, we have been even more prepared for defense at all times. The armed forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran will decisively respond to the aggressors with full authority.”\n## Qatar shoots down missiles\nQatar’s Defense Ministry says its military shot down several missiles before they reached its space. The ministry said the missile were dealt with as soon as they were detected “in accordance with the pre-approved security plan.”\nThe Ministry of Defense emphasizes that the Qatari Armed Forces possess the full capabilities and resources to protect the country.\n## US struck Iran from air and sea\nThe U.S. strikes took place from both air and sea, according to a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing military operations.\n———\nBy Konstantin Toropin in Washington.\n## Blasts heard in Qatar as Iran responds to attack\nExplosions could be heard in Qatar on Saturday as Iran launched a counterattack over the joint U.S. -Israel campaign targeting the Islamic Republic. There was no immediate word of any damage.\nIran responded to the campaign as it had been threatening to do for months — it first launched a wave of missiles and drones targeting Israel. Then later, it began apparently targeting U.S. military installations in Kuwait and Qatar as explosions could be heard.\n## Reactions from US lawmakers reflect political divisions\nThe early response from federal lawmakers to the U.S. government’s bombarding of Iran largely revolved around their feelings about Trump.\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who has long pushed for regime change in Iran, called for God to bless Trump. He said on social media that the attacks could provide freedom for the Iranian people, saying, “This operation is necessary and long justified.”\nSen. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., who was a Marine in the Iraq War, warned, “Young working-class kids should not pay the ultimate price for regime change and a war that hasn’t been explained or justified to the American people.”\nRep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., who has emerged as an opponent of Trump, said the president had engaged in “acts of war unauthorized by Congress.”\n## UAE closes airspace\nThe United Arab Emirates has closed its airspace as Israel and U.S. conduct strikes on Iran.\nThe disruption will have a major effect on global air travel as the country is home to two major long-haul carriers, Emirates and Etihad.\n## Bahrain says several sites attacked\nBahrain’s state news agency says that several facilities were hit inside the kingdom as a result of “an aggression” from outside the country.\nThe agency called the attack “a flagrant violation of the kingdom’s sovereignty and security,” and said authorities in Bahrain are implementing “emergency measures.”\n“The kingdom of Bahrain strongly condemns this treacherous aggression that forms a direct threat to the kingdom and its citizens,” it said.\n## Mobile phone warnings in Qatar\nIn Qatar, warning alerts went off on people’s mobile phones.\n## Sirens and blasts reported in Kuwait\nWitnesses heard sirens and explosions in Kuwait, home to U.S. Army Central. There was no immediate word on any damage.\n## US and Israeli strikes suggest wider campaign, Dutch analyst says\nStrikes in Iran by Israel and the U.S. suggests “shaping actions” designed to degrade air defenses in a pattern typical of a wider military campaign, a Dutch intelligence firm said.\n“The broader pattern suggests preparatory shaping actions,” said Eric Schouten, CEO of Dyami security intelligence firm in the Netherlands. “This appears less like a symbolic strike and more like the opening phase of a coordinated campaign designed to establish air superiority and operational freedom of movement.\n“Neutralizing radar systems, surface-to-air missile batteries, and command nodes would create more permissive conditions for sustained air operations over Iranian territory.”\n## Streets in Israel empty as sirens wail\nIn Israel, the public was instructed to stay close to shelters. Streets were mostly empty as a series of sirens continued to sound for most of Saturday morning. Israel’s main news programs shifted their broadcasts to bomb shelters as well.\n## US 5th Fleet service center was attacked, Bahrain says\nBahrain’s state news agency says the service center of the U.S. 5th Fleet was subjected to a missile attack. The agency said it will give further details later.\n## Israel says operation was planned for months\nIsrael said the attack on Iran was carried out as a “broad, coordinated, and joint operation against the regime” that has been planned for months between the Israeli and U.S. militaries.\n## Explosions heard in skies over Syria and Lebanon\nAssociated Press journalists in Damascus and in the city of Sidon in southern Lebanon heard sounds of explosions Saturday, apparently as a result of Israeli air defenses intercepting Iranian missiles.\n## US embassies in Middle East advise Americans to take cover\nU.S. embassies or consulates in Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Israel posted on social media that they told staffers to shelter in place and recommended all Americans “do the same until further notice.”\n## Iranian state TV shows damaged buildings\nIranian state television aired footage of heavily damaged buildings in Tehran, with rescuers digging through the rubble, looking for survivors.\n## Iran launches drones and missiles against Israel\nIran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard says it has launched its “first wave” of drones and missiles targeting Israel, suggesting it planned further attacks.\n## US personnel in Qatar told to shelter in place\nThe U.S. Embassy in Qatar posted on social media that it told all personnel to shelter in place, adding that “we recommend all Americans do the same until further notice.”\nQatar hosts a major air base that is the forward headquarters of U.S. Central Command and hosts thousands of American service members. Al Udeid Air Base was targeted by Iran in June in retaliation for the U.S. attacks on its nuclear facilities.\n## Trump was dissatisfied with Iran talks on Friday\nTrump on Friday began to voice a degree of frustration and impatience over the lack of satisfactory progress in negotiations to stop Iran’s ability to develop nuclear weapons, after having stayed relatively cryptic on his plans earlier in the week.\n“I’m not happy with the fact that they’re not willing to give us what we have to have,” Trump told reporters as he left the White House on Friday for Texas. “They cannot have nuclear weapons.”\nThe president also said before the attack that there was a risk of a prolonged conflict with Iran.\nBut he declined to telegraph his intentions when asked about a possible strike, saying to reporters: “I’d rather not tell you.”\n## Iranian-backed Houthis say they’ll resume attacks\nThe Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen have decided to resume missile and drone attacks on shipping routes and on Israel in support of Iran. That’s according to two senior Houthi officials, who spoke in condition of anonymity because there is no official announcement from the Houthi leadership.\nOne of the officials said the rebels’ first attack could come as soon as “tonight.”\nThe rebels ceased their attacks on the Red Sea shipping route as part of a deal with the Trump administration that also halted U.S. strikes against the Houthis. They also stopped their attacks against Israel after an October ceasefire that halted major fighting in Gaza.\n———\nBy Samy Magdy, in Cairo.\n## Israeli prime minister says attack is to remove Iranian threat\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the joint attack with the U.S. was to “remove an existential threat posed” by Iran.\n## Iran’s missile capability and nuclear program\nIran currently has a self-imposed limit on its ballistic missile program, limiting its range to 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles).\nThat puts all the Middle East and some of eastern Europe within reach. There is no public evidence of Iran seeking to have intercontinental ballistic missiles, though Washington has criticized its space program as potentially allowing it to one day.\nIran has also said it no longer enriches uranium, but it has blocked international inspectors from visiting the sites the United States bombed during the 12-day war in June.\nSatellite photos analyzed by The Associated Press have shown new activity at two of those sites, suggesting Iran is trying to assess and potentially recover material there.\n## Large build-up of US forces in the region\nAhead of the strikes, Trump built up the largest U.S. military presence in the Middle East in decades. The arrival of the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and three guided-missile destroyers at the end of January bolstered the number of warships in the region.\nThe world’s largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, and four accompanying destroyers later were dispatched from the Caribbean to head to the Middle East and are now in the Mediterranean.\nThe carriers and other ships have added more than 10,000 U.S. troops to the region. The military also has a variety of other troops in the Middle East, notably at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, which hosts thousands of service members.\nPlus, hundreds of fighter jets and other support aircraft necessary for launching a major attack on Iran have been sent to the region.\n## Blasts in northern Israel and sirens in Jordan\nExplosions rocked northern Israel on Saturday as the country worked to intercept incoming Iranian missiles after launching a nationwide attack with the U.S. on Iran.\nThe blasts echoed just after the Israeli military said it would be using its air defense systems to bring down the Iranian fire.\nThere was no immediate word on any damage or casualties from the ongoing attack.\nSirens also sounded in Jordan.\n## Israel says air defenses to activate\nIsrael issued a nationwide warning Saturday after Iran reportedly launched missiles targeting the country.\nThe Israeli military said air defense systems would be activated to defend the country.\n## There may be US casualties in operations against Iran, Trump says\nTrump acknowledged that the operations against Iran may lead to U.S. casualties.\n“The lives of courageous American heroes may be lost, and we may have casualties,” he said in a video posted to social media early Saturday morning. “That often happens in war.”\nIn the video, Trump wore a white baseball cap with the letters USA, a navy suit and white shirt with no necktie. There appeared to be a dark blue curtain behind him as the president announced the war in a video from Mar-a-Lago, his home and club in Palm Beach, Florida.\nAfter the June attacks on Iran’s nuclear sites, Trump said, “We warned them never to resume their malicious pursuit of nuclear weapons. And we sought repeatedly to make a deal. We tried.”\nHe added that Iran “rejected every opportunity to renounce their nuclear ambitions, and we can’t take it anymore.”\n## Iran blocked inspectors from nuclear sites\nIran has said it hasn’t enriched uranium since June, but it has blocked international inspectors from visiting the sites the United States bombed during the 12-day war then.\nSatellite photos analyzed by The Associated Press have shown new activity at two of those sites, suggesting Iran is trying to assess and potentially recover material there.\n## Trump accuses Iran of trying to rebuild nuclear program\nDespite claims that last year’s strike against Iran’s nuclear facilities destroyed the country’s nuclear program, Trump said that Iran “attempted to rebuild their nuclear program and to continue developing the long-range missiles that can now threaten our very good friends and allies in Europe, our troops stationed overseas, and could soon reach the American homeland.”\nTrump said that Saturday’s strikes would be part of “a massive and ongoing operation” that will aim to “destroy their missiles and raze their missile industry to the ground” as well as “annihilate their navy,” and “ensure that the region’s terrorist proxies can no longer destabilize the region or the world and attack our forces.”\n## Trump tells Iranian officials to lay down arms or ‘face death’\nTrump called the attacks on Iran “a noble mission,” saying they were necessary because of Iran’s pursuit of nuclear weapons and missile systems that could reach the U.S.\nHe called on Iranian officials to “lay down your arms” or “you will face certain death,” and encouraged the Iranian people to “take over your government — it will be yours to take.”\n## Iraq closes its airspace\nIraq’s Ministry of Transport said Saturday the country’s airspace has been closed following airstrikes on neighboring Iran.\nThe ministry’s spokesman, Mitham al-Safi, told state-run Iraqi News Agency that “the closure was preceded by the evacuation of all air traffic from Iraqi airspace.”\n## Trump says US begins ‘major combat operations in Iran’\nThe U.S. began “major combat operations in Iran,” President Donald Trump said in a video on Truth Social.\nHe said the objective is to defend the U.S. by “eliminating imminent threats from the Iranian regime.”\n## U.S. is taking part in strikes on Iran, sources tell AP\nThe United States is participating in the strikes, according to a U.S. official and a person familiar with the operation, who spoke on condition of anonymity to detail sensitive military operations. The full extent of U.S. involvement was not immediately clear.\n———\nBy Konstantin Toropin in Washington\n## Explosions heard in Tehran\nTwo residents reported hearing the sounds of strikes echoing across the Iranian capital. A resident in the area of Mehrabad airport reported the sounds of “two heavy explosions” shaking windows just over half an hour ago.\nIn central Tehran near Vanak, another resident reported the sounds of “blasts and war” coming at almost the same moment.\n## Israel Airports Authority says Israel’s airspace is completely closed\nPlanes that were en route to land in Israel are now being sent to area airports. Passengers who were at the airport awaiting flights are being shuttled back to various locations within Israel."

Explosions also rang out in nearby oil-producing [Gulf Arab countries], which said they had intercepted missiles from Iran after Tehran warned it would strike the region if it was attacked.\nSign up [here.] \nThe first wave of strikes in what the Pentagon named &quot;OPERATION EPIC FURY&quot; mainly targeted Iranian officials, a source familiar with the matter said.\nAn Israeli official said Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Masoud Pezeshkian were both targeted but the result of the strikes was not clear. A source with knowledge of the matter had earlier told Reuters that Khamenei was not in Tehran and had been transferred to a secure location.\nAn Iranian source close to the establishment said several senior commanders in Iran&#x27;s Revolutionary Guards and political officials had been killed. Forty people were killed in an Israeli airstrike on a school, state media said. Reuters could not independently confirm the reports.\n## HOPES DIM FOR DIPLOMATIC SOLUTION TO NUCLEAR DISPUTE\nThe renewed confrontation between Iran and its long-time foes dimmed hopes of a diplomatic solution to Tehran&#x27;s nuclear dispute with the West. The latest indirect talks between the U.S. and Iran this week failed to produce a breakthrough.\nIran&#x27;s Revolutionary Guards said all [U.S. bases] and interests in the region were within Iran&#x27;s reach and that the retaliation would continue until &quot;the enemy is decisively defeated&quot;.\nIran&#x27;s foreign minister told counterparts from Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain and Iraq that Tehran would use all its defensive and military capabilities to defend itself.\nLoud booms sounded in the United Arab Emirates capital Abu Dhabi, an oil producer and U.S. ally. Fighter jets flew around the Yas Island area of Abu Dhabi on Saturday afternoon and blasts were heard in the country&#x27;s business capital Dubai.\nBahrain said the service center of the U.S. Fifth Fleet had been subjected to a missile attack. Video footage from witnesses in Bahrain showed a thick grey plume of smoke rising from near the small island state&#x27;s coastline as sirens wailed.\nFellow Gulf Arab state Qatar said it had downed all missiles targeting the country and that it had a right to respond. Sirens were later heard in its capital Doha.\nExplosions were heard near Iran&#x27;s Kharg Island. Iran exports 90 percent of its crude oil via Kharg, for shipping through the narrow Strait of Hormuz.\n[Global airlines] cancelled flights across the Middle East and the attacks raised the prospect of oil prices rising.\n&quot;If we don’t see signs of de-escalation over the weekend, risk premiums could still drive Brent (crude) up by $10–$20/bbl (a barrel) on Monday,&quot; said Jorge Leon, head of geopolitical analysis at Rystad Energy.\n## TRUMP CITES 1979 HOSTAGE CRISIS\nItem 1 of 11 Smoke rises in the sky after blasts were heard in Manama, Bahrain, February 28, 2026. REUTERS/Stringer\n**[1/11]**Smoke rises in the sky after blasts were heard in Manama, Bahrain, February 28, 2026. REUTERS/Stringer [Purchase Licensing Rights, opens new tab] \nIn a video message published on social media, [Trump] cited Washington&#x27;s decades-old dispute with Iran, including the seizure of the 1979 U.S. embassy in Tehran, when students held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days, as well as a range of other attacks the U.S. has blamed on Iran since the 1979 Islamic revolution brought the clerics to power.\nHe urged Iranians to stay sheltered because &quot;bombs will be dropping everywhere&quot;. But he also added: &quot;When we are finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take. This will be probably your only chance for generations.”\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the joint U.S.-Israeli attack &quot;will create the conditions for the brave Iranian people to take their destiny into their own hands&quot; and &quot; remove the yoke of tyranny&quot;. Defence Minister Israel Katz called it a pre-emptive strike to remove threats to Israel.\nThe scope of the U.S. air and sea operations was not immediately clear. The campaign is expected to last for multiple days, a U.S. official said.\nIn Tehran, witnesses said people were rushing to banks to withdraw cash. Long queues formed at gas stations across cities. Many also worried about a potential internet blackout that would cut off communication with their families abroad.\n“We are being killed by the regime and by Israel. We are the victims of this regime’s hostile policies,” said Maryam, 54, a [housewife in Tehran], as she headed to northern Iran with her family.\nIsrael&#x27;s military did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the strike at a primary school for girls southern Iran, where Iranian state media reported 40 deaths.\nIraq&#x27;s Iran-aligned armed group Kataib Hezbollah said it would soon attack U.S. bases in the region.\n## US MILITARY BUILDUP\n[Trump] had built up a vast U.S. military presence in the region to try to force Tehran to make concessions in the nuclear talks. He said the &quot;massive&quot; operation was intended to ensure Tehran does not obtain a nuclear weapon.\nThe U.S. and Iran renewed negotiations in February on the nuclear dispute. Iran, which denies seeking atomic bombs, said it was prepared to discuss curbs on its nuclear programme in exchange for lifting [sanctions] but ruled out linking the issue to missiles.\nIran&#x27;s ballistic missile programme has been a significant sticking point, with Trump saying Tehran was developing long-range missiles that threaten the U.S.\n&quot;Our objective is to defend the American people by eliminating imminent threats from the Iranian regime,&quot; Trump said.\nThe attacks follows a 12-day air war last June between Israel and Iran and repeated U.S.-Israeli warnings that they would strike again if Iran pressed ahead with its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.\nAn Israeli defence official said the operation had been planned for months in coordination with Washington, and that the launch date was decided weeks ago.\nThe Israeli military announced the [closure of schools] and workplaces, with exceptions for essential sectors, and a ban on public airspace. Israel closed its airspace to civilian flights.\nReporting by Reuters bureaux; Writing by Michael Georgy; Editing by Barbara Lewis, Sam Holmes and Timothy Heritage\nOur Standards: [The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles., opens new tab] \nShare\n*\nX\n*\nFacebook\n*\nLinkedin\n*\nEmail\n*\nLink\n[Purchase Licensing Rights] \n[\n] \n[Alexander Cornwell] \nThomson Reuters\nAlexander has over a decade of international reporting experience.

The United States has deployed the USS Gerald Ford and USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier strike groups to the region, along with fighter jets, refueling tankers, and air defense systems. Top U.S. officials have [publicly demanded] that Iran end uranium enrichment, curb its ballistic missile program, and sever support for its proxy network. Meanwhile, Tehran has sought to [limit negotiations] to its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. On February 19, President Donald Trump stated that he will decide within ten days whether to [take military action]. It remains unclear whether potential strikes would target Iranian [nuclear sites], missile stockpiles, or aim to topple the regime. In response to the heightened U.S. military presence, Iran has temporarily closed the Strait of Hormuz—one of the world’s most significant oil and natural gas chokepoints—to [conduct live-fire drills].\n\nTrump initially threatened military intervention in the wake of [massive anti-government protests] that began in late December 2025, which prompted a severe government crackdown estimated to have [killed thousands] of Iranians.\n\n## History of Iran’s Nuclear Program\n\nIran has pursued a nuclear program since at least 1957, with varying degrees of success. During a war with Iraq, Iran decided to develop nuclear weapons to ensure its security in the late 1980s. Consequently, Iran pursued agreements with China and Russia to support the program’s research throughout the 1990s. In the summer of 2002, the National Council of Resistance of Iran, an umbrella organization made up of Iranian dissident groups, [exposed the existence] of two Iranian nuclear sites that were hidden from the IAEA.\n\nBy 2003, diplomats launched an [intensive effort] to halt Iran’s nuclear program. Iran agreed, insisting only on keeping its centrifuges for nuclear energy. However, it did not follow through on its commitment to transparent reporting to the IAEA and continued covert activities, leading to a [June 2004 rebuke] and a [September 2005 finding] of non-compliance by the IAEA, paving the way for a future referral to the UN Security Council (UNSC). In 2006, the UNSC adopted [Resolution 1696], the first legally binding call for Iran to suspend its uranium enrichment program. Over the next few years, the UNSC adopted a series of resolutions imposing crippling economic sanctions on Iran for its failure to suspend its enrichment-related activities.\n\nBetween 2011 and 2015, the compounding effects of international sanctions led Iran’s [economy to contract] by 20 percent and [unemployment to rise] to 20 percent. In 2013, Hassan Rouhani, a noted pragmatist, won Iran’s presidential election, campaigning on a promise to [lift sanctions] and restore the economy. Over the next two years, the United States convened several rounds of bilateral talks and led the other P5+1 coalition members—China, France, Germany, Russia, and the United Kingdom—in negotiations with Iran’s new leadership. These efforts culminated in the adoption of the [Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action] (JCPOA) in 2015. Once key parties signed the agreement, the UNSC approved [UN Resolution 2231], paving the way for sanctions relief.\n\nThe JCPOA required Iran to [reduce its stockpile] of enriched uranium by 98 percent for fifteen years, cut the number of operating centrifuges by two-thirds for ten years, and provide inspectors [access to enrichment facilities] within twenty-four days if the IAEA suspects violations. Moreover, if the IAEA confirmed violations, the JCPOA allowed for the immediate reinstatement of sanctions. After the JCPOA entered into force on January 16, 2016, Iran received [sanctions relief] totaling nearly $100 billion. However, Iran continued to [develop ballistic missiles], which, according to the United States, violated UN Resolution 2231.\n\n## Iran’s Regional Proxies\n\nThough the JCPOA limited Iran’s nuclear ambitions, its regional ambitions continued to grow. Iran persisted in [arming and training] Shiite militants through its [Quds Force] —the international arm of the [Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps] (IRGC)—which has exacerbated sectarian divisions in the Middle East. Iran has provided years of [military aid and training] to the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which enabled its October 7, 2023, attack on Israel. The Quds Force has also provided [advanced armed drones] to Hezbollah in Lebanon, trained and funded more than [one hundred thousand] Shiite fighters in Syria, supplied [ballistic missiles] and [drones] to Yemen’s Houthis, and helped Shiite militias in Iraq [build missile capabilities].\n\nThe U.S. government considers Iran to be the [foremost state sponsor of terrorism], spending more than one billion dollars on terrorist financing annually. There are between [140,000 and 185,000] IRGC-Quds Force partner forces across Afghanistan, Gaza, Lebanon, Pakistan, Syria, and Yemen.\n\n## Trump’s First-Term Clash With Iran\n\nBecause the JCPOA only addressed Iran’s nuclear program—and not its revisionism or ballistic missile programs—the first Trump administration [withdrew the United States] from the agreement, pledging to seek a more comprehensive deal. In 2018, the Trump administration began [reimposing sanctions] on Iran and demanded that European countries withdraw from the JCPOA as part of a new containment strategy. U.S. sanctions sparked the [worst economic crisis] Iran has faced in forty years, [cutting Iranian oil exports] by more than half and [emboldening Iranian hardliners].\n\nWhile the Trump administration pursued a strategy of maximum pressure to bring Iran to the [negotiating table], Iran began to contravene the JCPOA’s restrictions on its nuclear program, raising tensions. In April 2019, the United States designated the IRGC a terrorist organization. When the Trump administration received intelligence of potential Iranian attacks on U.S. troops, it deployed bombers, carriers, and additional forces to the Middle East. Over the next month, [six oil tankers] in or near the Strait of Hormuz were attacked, which U.S. government officials blamed on Iran.\n\nIn late June 2019, Iran [downed] a U.S. [Global Hawk drone] in the Strait of Hormuz; President Trump ordered a [cyberattack] and the imposition of [new sanctions] in response. On December 31, Trump blamed Iran for backing protests that tried to seize the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. Days later, tensions peaked when the United States killed [Qasem Soleimani], the commander of Iran’s Quds Force, in a Baghdad air strike. In response, Iran said it would no longer adhere to [restrictions] under the nuclear deal, and it accidentally [shot down] a Ukrainian passenger plane while on high alert. In late 2020, Trump continued to ratchet up [sanctions], and Iran [boosted] uranium enrichment to levels well beyond the limits of the nuclear deal after one of its top nuclear scientists was killed.\n\n## Conflict Between Israel and Iran\n\nThe outbreak of war between Israel, a close U.S. ally, and the Palestinian Iran-backed militant group Hamas in October 2023 escalated tensions between Iran and Israel. Iran-backed proxy forces ramped up strikes in protest of Israel’s military incursion into the Gaza Strip, including more than [two hundred attacks] on U.S. and Israeli targets in Iraq and Syria. In response, the United States ordered air strikes on two Iran-backed facilities on October 26, 2023, and eighty-five more Iran-affiliated targets in the two countries on February 2, 2024. The [Houthis in Yemen] and [Hezbollah in Lebanon] —both actors in Iran’s axis of resistance—also launched attacks from the Red Sea and Israel’s northern border with Lebanon, spurring fears of regional spillover.\n\nIn 2024, Israel and Iran’s confrontation shifted from indirect, proxy-based hostilities to direct exchanges of strikes. On April 1, a suspected [Israeli air strike] against an Iranian consular building in Damascus, Syria, killed two of its generals and five military advisors. Iran retaliated by launching over three hundred [drone and missile attacks], the first time Iran had [directly targeted] Israel.\n\nFollowing Israel’s killing of the leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah, Iran launched [180 ballistic missiles] against Israel in October 2024. Israel then launched its [largest direct attack] on Iran, targeting its air defenses and missile production facilities. Israel’s decimation of [Hamas and Hezbollah leadership], coupled with the downfall of the Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria, considerably weakened Iran’s axis of resistance in 2024.\n\nUpon returning to office in 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump restored his maximum pressure campaign against Tehran while also initiating negotiations on its nuclear program—the [first direct U.S.-Iran talks] since he withdrew the United States from the JCPOA nuclear deal in 2018. Israel was wholly opposed to the negotiations and has maintained an unwavering commitment to dismantling Iran’s nuclear program. Israeli officials argue that Iran’s clandestine efforts to develop nuclear weapons would fundamentally alter the regional balance of power, posing a [direct danger] to Israel’s survival.\n\nOn June 12, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) declared Iran was violating its [non-proliferation obligations] for the first time in twenty years, prompting Iran to announce it would open a secret uranium enrichment site. The next day, Israel launched a [unilateral military strike] against Iran, targeting nuclear facilities, missile factories, senior military officials, and nuclear scientists. Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi [declared the attack] “an act of war,” and Iran retaliated by launching waves of drones and dozens of ballistic missiles. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the operation as a last-resort effort to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Although the Trump administration had recently [resumed nuclear negotiations], President Trump increasingly [voiced support] for Israel’s objectives and signaled his openness to [regime change] in Tehran.\n\nFollowing a week of air strikes between Israel and Iran, the United States [directly intervened] in the conflict, attacking three Iranian nuclear sites in Fordow, Isfahan, and Natanz on June 21. The Trump administration claimed the strikes [significantly hindered] Iran’s capacity to achieve weapons-grade uranium, but the head of the UN nuclear watchdog assessed the program was set back by a matter of months. Trump is the [first U.S. president] to attack another country’s nuclear program and the first to explicitly join Israel in an attack on an adversary. Iran retaliated on June 23, launching a [missile attack on U.S. forces] stationed at the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar; no casualties were reported. Trump announced a ceasefire later that day. Although both sides accused the other of [continuing strikes], the truce has largely held.\n\nMore on Iran’s Conflict With Israel and the United States\n\n[Iran Regime Attempts Creative Negotiating StanceCFR Expert BriefFebruary 10, 2026] \n\n[Why a Nervous Mideast Braces for a New Round of UpheavalCFR Expert BriefFebruary 20, 2026] \n\n[Iran’s Protests and the Internet Blackout That FollowedCFR ArticleJune 18, 2025] \n\n[Global Options for Defending Iranians’ RightsCFR Expert BriefFebruary 2, 2026] \n\n[What Are Iran’s Nuclear and Missile Capabilities?CFR ArticleJune 12, 2025] \n\n[Iran’s Regional Armed NetworkCFR.orgApril 15, 2024] \n\n[Assessing the Damage of Attacks on Iranian Nuclear TargetsCFR ArticleJune 22, 2025] \n\n[U.S. Relations With IranCFR TimelineAugust 18, 2025] \n\n[The Islamic Republic’s Power CentersCFR ArticleJune 16, 2025] \n\n[The Ripple Effect of UN Sanctions on Iran’s Nuclear ProgramCFR Expert BriefSeptember 29, 2025] \n\nNearby Conflicts\n\n[Tensions Between Armenia and Azerbaijan] \n\n[Instability in Iraq] \n\n[Conflict in Syria] \n\nLatest News\n\n##### U.S. Guidance on Leaving Israel\n\nFebruary 27, 2026\n\nAs the United States weighs a strike on Iran, it authorized non-essential government staff and family members to depart Israel, citing unspecified “safety risks” [(U.S. Embassy Jerusalem)]. China also urged its citizens in Iran to evacuate as soon as possible [(Reuters)]. The threat of renewed conflict comes as Israel’s stockpiles of ground-based ballistic missile interceptors and U.S. land- and sea-based antiballistic missile systems, both used extensively during the June 2025 Iran–Israel conflict, were significantly depleted, raising concerns about the sustainability of Israel’s air defense coverage in the event of another exchange [(NYT)]. Separately, the International Atomic Energy Agency reported that some of Iran’s uranium enriched to up to 60 percent purity, near weapons grade, is stored in an underground tunnel complex at its Isfahan nuclear site, which appears largely undamaged despite U.S. and Israeli strikes that hit the facility’s entrance in June [(Reuters)].\n\n##### Third Round of U.S.-Iran Talks\n\nFebruary 26, 2026\n\nThe United States and Iran held another round of indirect nuclear talks today in Geneva, with both sides threatening war if diplomacy fails [(BBC)]. The countries are floating proposals that include limiting the amount of uranium Iran is allowed to enrich, temporarily suspending Iran’s enrichment activity, and dismantling its main nuclear sites, according to reports from multiple news outlets [(Guardian)]. Both sides agreed to resume negotiations within a week, with additional technical-level discussions scheduled in Vienna [(Reuters)]. The state news agency of mediator Oman said today that both sides were demonstrating “unprecedented openness to new and creative ideas and solutions” [(Oman News Agency)]. Further, the foreign minister of Oman said the talks had achieved “significant progress,” but did not announce a breakthrough that would avert an attack [(Oman FM)].\n\n##### Iran Optimistic on U.S. Talks as Protests Expand\n\nFebruary 25, 2026\n\nIranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said he sees a chance for a positive outcome from a third round of talks with the United States in Geneva [(Reuters)]. Meanwhile, BBC verified footage shows additional universities joining anti-government protests across Iran [(BBC)]. Tokyo “strongly demanded” the release of a Japanese national detained in Iran since January, following a report by RFE/RL that Iranian authorities had arrested the Tehran bureau chief of the Japanese public broadcaster NHK World; the RFE/RL report cited unnamed sources [(Japan Times)].\n\n##### Trump Calls for Nuclear Deal in State of the Union Address\n\nFebruary 24, 2026\n\nTrump said he sought a nuclear deal with Iran to thwart the country’s “sinister ambitions” to obtain nuclear weapons, but said he had yet to hear Iran commit to abandoning those ambitions; he also warned that Iran was trying to develop missiles that could reach the United States [(NYT)]. Separately, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said that a deal with the United States was only feasible if diplomacy was prioritized [(Reuters)]. This comes as Iran nears a deal with China to purchase anti-ship cruise missiles; though no delivery date has been agreed upon, the use of the CM-302 missile would improve Iran’s strike capabilities and pose a threat to U.S. naval forces [(Reuters)].\n\n##### Iranian Students Continue Protests as U.S.-Iran Tensions Heighten\n\nFebruary 23, 2026\n\nIranian students continued protests for a third day, as state media reported students burning flags at an all-women university, chanting anti-government slogans, and skirmishes at Amir Kabir University in Tehran [(Reuters)]. This comes amid escalating U.S.-Iran tensions, as Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei stated that any U.S. attack, including preliminary strikes, would be considered an act of aggression and would prompt a response [(Al Jazeera)]. Meanwhile, the United States began evacuating non-essential staff and eligible family members from the U.S. Embassy in Beirut amid increased concern about a military conflict with Iran [(Reuters)]. However, U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff chair Dan Caine has warned Trump and other officials that a military campaign against Iran could incur significant costs to U.S. forces and weapons, multiple news outlets reported, citing unnamed officials [(NYT)]. Caine’s office said in a statement that he confidentially gives the president a range of options and associated risks [(WSJ)]. While the White House praised Caine in a statement, Trump wrote on social media that it is “100% incorrect” that Caine is “against us going to War with Iran” [(Truth Social)].\n\n##### Plans for More Iran Talks\n\nFebruary 22, 2026\n\nNegotiations between the United States and Iran over Tehran’s nuclear program will likely continue in Geneva on Thursday, Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi told CBS News [(CBS)]. Unnamed U.S. officials also confirmed plans for the meeting to multiple news outlets, but stressed that Trump is still considering military strikes amid the large-scale U.S. deployment in the region [(Axios;] [NYT)]. In Iran, meanwhile, antigovernment protests have reignited as the new school semester begins in spite of the regime’s recent brutal crackdowns [(NYT)].\n\n##### Trump Signals Deadline for Nuclear Deal\n\nFebruary 19, 2026\n\nTrump told reporters that Iran has ten or “pretty much maximum” fifteen days to reach a deal with the United States or “bad things” will happen [(Bloomberg)].\n\n##### Araghchi Says Some Progress Made in Geneva\n\nFebruary 18, 2026\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi stated that some progress was made in Geneva by reaching an understanding on “guiding principles,” but that this progress does not indicate an imminent nuclear deal [(Reuters)]. U.S. officials have further stated that Iran needs to draft a detailed proposal for a deal in two weeks [(Axios)]. As negotiations continue, the U.S. military is amassing its greatest airpower buildup in the Middle East since the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the Wall Street Journal reported [(WSJ)]. Meanwhile, satellite images show that Iran has been making repairs to and fortifying military and nuclear sites bombed by the United States and Israel [(Reuters)].\n\n##### U.S. and Iran Pursuing Talks in Geneva\n\nFebruary 17, 2026\n\nU.S.-Iran negotiations ended with a commitment to meet again, but Iran failed to acknowledge certain U.S. red lines, Vice President JD Vance told Fox News [(Fox News)]. While Tehran has sought a narrow deal on its nuclear program as well as sanctions relief, Washington has signaled it seeks a more expansive agreement that could also address Tehran’s missile stockpile [(NYT)]. Portions of the Strait of Hormuz were closed for “security precautions” as the Revolutionary Guards conducted military drills in the strait [(Reuters)]. The closure included live-fire drills, a rare show of force [(AP)]. Separately, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei threatened to sink U.S. warships in the region [(The Hill)]. Open-source flight radar data shows that dozens of U.S. fighter jets have moved to positions near Iran this week [(Axios)].\n\n##### U.S. Heightens Military Presence in Region\n\nFebruary 16, 2026\n\nThe United States has increased its military deployments in the region, while Iran conducted military drills in the Strait of Hormuz [(CNN)]. Iran’s foreign minister met with the UN nuclear chief ahead of Tuesday’s talks in Geneva [(AP)].\n\n##### Global Protests Against Iranian Regime\n\nFebruary 15, 2026\n\nHundreds of thousands of people demonstrated in cities worldwide this weekend, who gathered to protest Iran’s current regime and its recent crackdown on dissent; Reza Pahlavi, the son of the exiled late shah of Iran, had called for a “global day of action” [(BBC)].\n\n##### Trump Expresses Support for Regime Change\n\nFebruary 13, 2026\n\nTrump suggested that “the best thing that could happen” would be regime change in Tehran [(France24)].\n\n##### Report on Starlink in Iran\n\nFebruary 12, 2026\n\nThe United States reportedly sent around six thousand of the company’s satellite internet kits to the country in recent weeks, in a secret effort to help dissidents withstand government restrictions on internet access, unnamed U.S. officials told the Wall Street Journal; the White House did not comment on the report, but had publicly said in January that Trump spoke to Starlink owner Elon Musk about ensuring connectivity in Iran [(WSJ)].\n\n##### Iran Maintains Red Line on Missile Program\n\nFebruary 11, 2026\n\nAn advisor to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei stated that Iran’s missile capabilities remain a red line as Washington and Tehran consider a second round of talks to avoid further escalation [(Reuters)]. However, Iran’s president said that the country is willing to open its nuclear sites for inspections to verify it is not building a nuclear weapon; the concession came the same day that Trump discussed Iran policy with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House [(FT)]. Trump wrote on social media that he told Netanyahu he will continue to seek a deal with Iran if possible, though he provided no further details [(Truth Social)].\n\n##### United States Used Mobile Launchers at Al-Udeid Base\n\nFebruary 10, 2026\n\nSatellite images from February 2 revealed that the United States placed missiles into truck launchers, rather than semi-static launcher stations, allowing for rapid deployment amid escalating tensions with Iran; it is unknown if the missiles remain in the truck launchers [(Reuters)]. Trump said he was considering sending a second U.S. aircraft carrier strike group to the Middle East if talks do not progress [(Axios)]. Before departing to meet President Trump in Washington, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told reporters his “first and foremost” goal was to press for a deal that covered more than just Iran’s nuclear program [(WaPo)].\n\n##### Iran Expands Crackdown on Dissent, Detains Reformists\n\nFebruary 9, 2026\n\nAuthorities arrested Azar Mansouri, head of the Reformist Front; Ebrahim Asgharzadeh, who led students who stormed the U.S. Embassy in 1979; and former diplomat Mohsen Aminzadeh in an expansion of crackdowns on dissent [(AP)]. Local media also reported that Javad Emam, Secretary General of Iran’s Assembly of Veterans, and Hossein Karoubi, son of reformist leader Mehdi Karoubi, were also among those detained; the detainees face charges of causing political divisions, plotting to overthrow the political system, and coordinating with enemy propaganda [(NYT)]. The Shargh newspaper further reported that two more members of the Reform Front were asked to report to the prosecutor’s office on Tuesday [(Reuters)]. Separately, the United States warned U.S.-flagged commercial ships to stay “as far as possible” from Iran’s territorial waters [(U.S. DoT)].\n\n##### Iran Will Not Accept Ban on Nuclear Enrichment\n\nFebruary 8, 2026\n\nFollowing indirect talks with the United States on Friday, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi added that Iran is prepared to build trust that its enrichment is for peaceful purposes [(Reuters)]. Trump is due to discuss the results of the talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday [(AP)]. Meanwhile, Iran’s judiciary sentenced activist and Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Narges Mohammadi, who was detained in December and was reported to be on a hunger strike, to at least another seven years in prison on charges including collusion and propaganda, her lawyer wrote on social media [(X)].\n\n##### U.S.-Iran Talks Begin in Oman\n\nFebruary 6, 2026\n\nOman mediated indirect talks today between the United States and Iran focused on “sustaining security and stability,” its foreign ministry said in a statement [(Oman FM)]. Both sides described the talks as positive but inconclusive [(Bloomberg)]. Omani state media footage also showed the head of U.S. Central Command participating on the U.S. side, a role he had not played in previous rounds of talks [(AP)]. Meanwhile, the State Department announced new sanctions on actors it said illegally transported Iranian oil and indirectly funded the country’s repression at home and “terror organizations” abroad [(State)].\n\n##### U.S-Iran Nuclear Talks Moved to Oman\n\nFebruary 4, 2026\n\nThe Trump administration agreed to Iran’s request to move Friday’s nuclear talks from Turkey to Oman [(Axios)]. The change in venue comes as Iran seeks to continue previous discussion rounds held in the country and to prevent discussions from expanding to include issues such as its ballistic missile program, which Tehran has stated is a red line in negotiations [(Reuters)].\n\n##### U.S. Shoots Down Iranian Drone\n\nFebruary 3, 2026\n\nTwo Iranian military provocations against U.S. assets in the Middle East underscored high tensions ahead of negotiations planned for Friday [(WaPo)]. An Iranian drone “aggressively approached” a U.S. aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea, prompting a fighter jet from the carrier to shoot it down, a U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) spokesperson said [(CNN)]. Hours later, the U.S. Navy escorted a U.S.-flagged tanker to safety after it was approached by two Iranian gunboats that threatened to board the vessel [(CBS)]. The CENTCOM spokesperson said that Iran’s aggression increases “risks of collision, miscalculation, and regional destabilization” [(The Hill)]. Iran’s top officials did not immediately comment on the maritime incidents; the country’s semi-official Tasnim news agency reported that communications with a drone over international waters had been lost, though the reason remained unclear [(Reuters)]. The incidents could mean Iranian hardliners are resistant to talks, the Wall Street Journal reported [(WSJ)]. Officials from the United States and Israel, as well as Turkey and Saudi Arabia, held separate high-level meetings in Jerusalem and Riyadh that discussed the regional stakes of the upcoming U.S.-Iran talks [(Times of Israel;] [Asharq Al-Awsat)]. Turkey and the United Arab Emirates are among those urging Iran and the United States to negotiate rather than risk military conflict, a point Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan stressed during a meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman [(Reuters)]. U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who said Iran could not be trusted to uphold its promises [(Israeli PM)]. Iran has pushed for the negotiations to be moved from their planned location in Istanbul to Oman [(Axios)].\n\n##### Plan for U.S.-Iran Talks\n\nFebruary 2, 2026\n\nU.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi are expected to meet in Istanbul on Friday to discuss a potential nuclear deal and de-escalation of bilateral tensions, news outlets reported [(WaPo)]. The meeting will focus on negotiating a deal to prevent war amid a massive U.S. military buildup in the Gulf [(Axios)]. This comes as Iran’s leadership is increasingly concerned that a U.S. strike would reignite protests, with top officials warning Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei that, in light of widespread discontent over last month’s crackdowns, fear is no longer a deterrent to protest [(Reuters)].\n\n##### Khamenei Warns of “Regional War”\n\nFebruary 1, 2026\n\nIran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, warned that an attack by the United States would spark a greater “regional war” in the Middle East; Khamenei’s comments are the most direct threat he has made so far regarding U.S. escalation in the region [(AP)].\n\n##### EU Announces New Sanctions on Iran\n\nJanuary 29, 2026\n\nThe European Union (EU) sanctioned fifteen senior officials and six organizations in Iran for actions like surveilling and censoring online protest content [(European Council)]. The EU also designated Iran’s paramilitary guard a terrorist organization, which puts its officials under travel controls and other punitive actions and aligns Brussels with others who have done the same, including the United States and Canada [(X)]. The head of the European Parliament’s delegation for relations with Iran called the move a “long-overdue political signal that massive violence and transnational repression will no longer go unanswered,” while Iran’s top diplomat said it was a “strategic mistake” [(Guardian;] [Iran FM)]. More than six thousand people are confirmed to have been killed in countrywide demonstrations since the end of December, the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency said this week [(HRANA)]. Estimates from the Iranian government are lower, at about three thousand deaths [(AP)]. After initially threatening military action earlier this month over the crackdown, U.S. President Donald Trump later expanded those threats and tied them to demands for a deal on Iran’s nuclear program; though the United States has deployed an aircraft carrier strike group to the Middle East, Trump told reporters he had been speaking to Tehran in recent days and that “it would be great” if military action could be avoided [(White House)].\n\n##### Trump’s Threats to Attack Iran\n\nJanuary 28, 2026\n\nTrump called on Tehran to make a deal guaranteeing Iran has no nuclear weapons, warning that the United States could attack again if it refused; Trump added the U.S. naval deployment in the Middle East was ready to act with “speed and violence, if necessary” [(Truth Social)]. This week, both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) publicly stated the United States could not use their airspace for an attack on Iran [(Asharq Al-Awsat;] [Emirates News Agency)].\n\n##### U.S. Naval Assets Near Iran\n\nJanuary 26, 2026\n\nThe USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier and three naval destroyers have arrived in the Middle East, U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) announced [(CENTCOM)]. Trump has referenced the fleet’s impending arrival in his threats to strike Iran over its response to antigovernment protests in the country during recent weeks; however, the strike group remains in the Indian Ocean, CENTCOM said—not the Arabian Sea, which borders Iran [(AP)].\n\n##### U.S. Forces Near Iran\n\nJanuary 22, 2026\n\nThe United States is deploying “an armada” of warships near Iran “just in case” Iran’s response to protests becomes untenable, Trump told reporters [(CNN)]. At the same time, he voiced an openness to talk to the Iranian government; Iran’s foreign minister has similarly expressed willingness for dialogue with the United States but said the country is ready for war in the event of U.S. military action [(FT)].\n\n##### Toll of Iran Protests\n\nJanuary 21, 2026\n\nIran estimates that more than three thousand people have died in recent demonstrations, its government said in its first official death toll [(AP)]. The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency said that it had verified almost five thousand deaths, though other estimates are far greater [(HRANA)]. In recent days, the World Economic Forum in Davos rescinded its invitation to Iran’s foreign minister due to the widespread killings [(Euronews)].\n\n##### Protest Fallout for Iranian Businesses\n\nJanuary 20, 2026\n\nFirms in the country are hurting as an internet shutdown intended to stifle protests continues, with watchdog group NetBlocks estimating the blackout costs the economy more than $37 million per day; meanwhile, prosecutors in Tehran have begun filing paperwork to seize the assets of dozens of cafes they allege played a role in antigovernment protests, judicial news agency Mizan reported [(AP)].\n\n##### Iran Denies Execution Plan\n\nJanuary 15, 2026\n\nIran’s judiciary denied today that antigovernment protester Erfan Soltani has been sentenced to death; the case had garnered international attention [(Guardian)]. A Norway-based human rights group reported that an execution order shared with Soltani’s family has been postponed [(X)]. Separately, the United States announced new sanctions on Iranian officials, citing their “brutal crackdown against the Iranian people” [(Treasury)]. Gulf countries and Israel urged Trump in recent days not to strike Iran because of concerns that such actions could ignite a broader regional conflict, unnamed officials told multiple news outlets [(NYT)]. The White House press secretary said that “all options remain on the table” regarding Iran [(White House]).\n\n##### Iran Warns of Retaliation If Trump Strikes\n\nJanuary 14, 2026\n\nA senior Iranian official said Tehran would strike U.S. military bases in the Middle East if Trump were to intervene in Iran [(Reuters)].

For 40 years, Iran has been saying death to America, death to[Israel].”\n[\nDonald Trump says US has attacked three Iranian nuclear sites and ‘totally obliterated’ them\nRead more\n] \nIn a statement issued after Trump’s White House address, a federal government spokesperson did not explicitly endorse the strikes, but reiterated Australia’s position on the risk posed by Iran’s nuclear program.\n“We have been clear that Iran’s nuclear and ballistic missile program has been a threat to international peace and security,” a government spokesperson said.\n“We note the US president’s statement that now is the time for peace. The security situation in the region is highly volatile. We continue to call for de-escalation, dialogue and diplomacy.”\nSpeaking before news of the bombings broke, the defence minister, Richard Marles, refused to be drawn on whether a US attack would be justified.\nHowever, while repeating calls for a de-escalation in the conflict, Marles restated the government’s position that Iran’s nuclear and ballistic missile program was a threat to the region and “stability of the world”.\nThe government last week[deployed Australian Defence Force] (ADF) personnel to the Middle East to help evacuate citizens stuck in Israel and Iran amid the latest escalation in the conflict.\nThe number of Australian citizens seeking government help to evacuate the Middle East had reached 3,800 as of Sunday morning, including 2,600 people in Iran and 1,200 in Israel.\nMarles confirmed chartered civilian aircraft were ready to depart as soon as airspace over Iran and Israel reopened.\n“Australians in Israel and Iran and the region should continue to monitor public safety information provided by local authorities, including to shelter in place when required,” the government spokesperson said on Sunday.\n“The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will be communicating directly with registered Australians about preparations for assisted departures.”\nIn a statement, the federal opposition leader, Sussan Ley, and the acting shadow foreign minister, Andrew Hastie, said the Coalition supported the US attacks.\n“The world can never accept a nuclear-armed Iranian regime and today the United States military has taken proactive action to ensure that we never need to,” Ley and Hastie said in a statement.\n“While Australians will never seek conflict in the world, we can never forget that the Iranian regime is a militantly theocratic autocracy.”\nThe international law expert****Prof****Donald Rothwell****said it was “virtually impossible” to mount a case that the US strikes were legal under international law.\nUnder article 51 of the UN charter, states can use force to defend themselves from an armed attack.\nInternational law experts say the charter does not provide a broader right to pre-emptive attacks, such as the strikes Israel, and now the US, have launched on Iran.\nRothwell, a professor at the Australian National University, said given there had been no direct threat from Iran towards the US then Trump’s attack could not be justified.\n“It’s virtually impossible, I think, for the United States to mount any credible legal argument [for the strikes] on that basis,” he said.\nRothwell said the US attacks could set a precedent for how other countries would use self-defence arguments as cover for pre-emptive attacks.\n[\nAustralia’s claim that Israel has a right to defend itself against Iran is inconsistent with our rules-based order | Ben Saul\nRead more\n] \n“The really concerning aspect of this is the precedent it sets. If the United States can do this, and this is a precedent that the United States is taking in terms of its interpretation of self-defence, or the way in which you can use force, then other states will take that into account in terms of how they consider their own future conduct.”\nThe Australian Greens leader, Larissa Waters, said the federal government should condemn the US attacks which she described as a “terrifying and catastrophic escalation”.\n“From Iraq to Afghanistan, we have seen Australia follow the US into devastating and brutal wars that have done untold damage to the people of the Middle East,” she said. “We know that you cannot bomb your way to peace.”\nExplore more on these topics\n* [Middle East and north Africa] \n* [Anthony Albanese] \n* [Penny Wong] \n* [Iran] \n* [Israel] \n* [news] \n[Share\n] \n[Reuse this content] \n## Most viewed\n## Most viewed\n1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. * [US] \n* [US politics] \n* [World] \n* [Climate crisis] \n* [Middle East] \n* [Ukraine] \n* [Soccer] \n* [Business] \n* [Environment] \n* [Tech] \n* [Science] \n* [Newsletters] \n* [Wellness]"

On Monday, Iran&apos;s President Masoud Pezeshkian[said the US \"must receive a response] &quot;, while Iran&apos;s ambassador to the United Nations said the US had &quot;waged a war&quot; against it under an &quot;absurd pretext&quot;.\n### 'The key question is what happens next'\nSpeaking on ABC radio&apos;s RN program on Monday morning, Wong said the world had agreed &quot;Iran cannot be allowed to get a nuclear weapon&quot; and that Australia &quot;supports action to prevent that&quot;.\nIsrael has for decades warned Iran was developing a nuclear weapon. Iran has consistently denied that claim, saying its uranium enrichment program is exclusively for peaceful purposes such as energy.\nInternational assessments have found no evidence Iran has an active nuclear weaponisation program, and it is a signatory to the UN&apos;s Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Israel is not a signatory to the treaty, and is widely believed to possess nuclear weapons itself, but has never confirmed or denied this.\n###### READ MORE\n[\n![] \nWhat we know and don&#x27;t know about Iran&#x27;s nuclear ambitions\n] \nShortly before Israel launched strikes against Iran on 13 June, the UN nuclear watchdog said Iran was in breach of its non-proliferation obligations for the first time in 20 years, saying it had failed to provide the agency with &quot;full and timely co-operation regarding undeclared nuclear material and activities&quot;.\nWong said despite Australia supporting the US strikes, the &quot;key question is what happens next&quot;, and urged de-escalation.\n&quot;Australia says, like so many other countries, we do not want escalation and a full-scale war, and we continue to call for dialogue and diplomacy,&quot; she said.\nWong was asked if her calls for diplomacy extended to demanding Israel stop its attacks on Iran.\n&quot;We have seen strikes, we have seen what the US has done, we have seen the destruction, or the debilitation, of these nuclear facilities. Now is the time for diplomacy. Now is the time for de-escalation, and ... that call is to all parties,&quot; she said.\nWong also appeared on Channel 9&apos;s Today program, where she said the US had not made any requests of Australia regarding action in Iran, and wouldn&apos;t speculate on the future.\nShe wouldn&apos;t say whether or not Pine Gap, Australia&apos;s joint intelligence surveillance base with the US in the Northern Territory, played a role in the US strikes on the weekend.\nWong said more than 4,000 Australians had registered for help to leave the Middle East &#x2014; around 2,900 in Iran, and 1,300 in Israel. Australian officials have been deployed to Iran&apos;s border with Azerbaijan to assist Australians who were able to cross.\n&quot;People have to make a judgement about how risky that is.

This is an attack on our society, aimed at creating fear, stoking internal divisions and eroding social cohesion.\n\nThese attacks on our society are totally unacceptable and the Australian Government is taking strong and decisive action in response:\n\n- We have informed the Iranian ambassador to Australia he and three additional Iranian diplomats will be expelled.\n- We have suspended operations at our embassy in Tehran and all our diplomats are now safe in a third country.\n- The Government will legislate so we can list Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps – the IRGC - as a terrorist organisation.\n\nThe Australian people want the killing and hatred to stop, and they don’t want the conflict in the Middle East brought here.\n\nIran has sought to do just that. They have sought to harm and terrify Jewish Australians, and to sow hatred and division in our community.\n\nThe actions of the Albanese Government send a clear message that we stand against antisemitism and violence.\n\nIt also sends a message to those who try to interfere in our country: your aggression will not be tolerated.\n\n## Media enquiries\n\n- Minister's office: (02) 6277 7500\n- DFAT Media Liaison: (02) 6261 1555\n\n[Back to top]"

The world has long agreed that Iran cannot be allowed to get a nuclear weapon. And we support action to prevent that. That is what this is. The US action was directed at specific sites central to Iran's nuclear program. We don't want escalation and a full-scale war. We continue to call for dialogue and for diplomacy. As I've said for many days now, we are deeply concerned about any escalation in the region and we want to see diplomacy, dialogue and de-escalation. We've been upfront about the challenge facing the international community – that is, dealing with the threat posed by any Iranian nuclear weapons program and dealing with the risk of regional escalation. And that's why Australia called upon Iran to come to the table and abandon any nuclear weapons program. Iran didn't come to the table, just as it has repeatedly failed to comply with its international obligations. We urge Iran not to take any further action that could destabilise the region. Happy to take questions.\n\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, could you just explain why you've waited until now to explicitly express your support for this action? And is it because you want Australia to remain a non-central player in this conflict?\n\nPRIME MINISTER: Well, we aren't a central player in this conflict, that's just a fact. And what we do is we run an orderly, stable government. But I made comments about this in three countries, over recent days, and my comments today are perfectly consistent with that.\n\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, if I could just ask about – there's a concern from the US around retaliatory action when it comes to sleeper cells in the US. That's something that's been well reported over the last few hours. There's a sense that Iran has the capability to attack European-American nationals beyond the US and the Middle East, is also what's being reported. Was this discussed today and what would be your message to Australians who are seeing this sort of thing coming out in terms of any concern about a threat here in Australia?\n\nPRIME MINISTER: Well, precisely why we're calling for a de-escalation. And obviously we are opposed to any action against Australians or, indeed, against anyone else. What we want to see, as President Trump has said, is peace going forward. There's an opportunity for that to occur.\n\nPENNY WONG, MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS: Thank you, Prime Minister. I'll just add to that. Obviously there are always risks, not only from escalation in the region, but also potential for risk more broadly. I indicated publicly this morning that I have asked my Department to consider whether there are any – if there's any alteration to travel advice more generally, which we will obviously make sure is up to –\n\nJOURNALIST: Was that discussed at the National Security Committee?\n\nPRIME MINISTER: We don't talk about what we discuss at NSC.\n\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, can you confirm or provide any details to whether Australia has provided any military support via our bases in the region or indeed any signals support via our joint facilities here in Australia?\n\nPRIME MINISTER: Well, we don't talk about intelligence matters, but we confirm, of course, that this was a unilateral action by the United States.\n\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, what intelligence has been shared with your Government about whether Iran was imminently at the point of having a nuclear weapon? And following on from Jane's question –\n\nPRIME MINISTER: Refer to previous answers.\n\nJOURNALIST: You're a Government that talks about transparency and talks about being upfront with the Australian people. So, was a facility like Pine Gap used in this attack? Was information that's been garnered there used as part of this attack on Iran?\n\nPRIME MINISTER: We are upfront, but we don't talk about intelligence, obviously. But we've made very clear this was unilateral action taken by the United States.\n\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, just to return to the first question – why did it take 24 hours for Australia to express unequivocal support for this action by its closest ally? And what does this say about our relationship with the US under your Government?\n\nPRIME MINISTER: We issued a statement yesterday.\n\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, is Australia reviewing its terror threat level in the wake of what's been happening? And again, was there any discussions or is there any concerns surrounding potential sleeper cells within this country?\n\nPRIME MINISTER: Look, we are constantly under a position where the ASIO Director-General and our security intelligence agencies are constantly engaged in monitoring. There's been no change in any of the advice that has been issued.\n\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, PM Starmer noted that his Government was given prior warning of the US action in Iran, I think quite shortly before it took place, but he was given warning. Was ours?\n\nPRIME MINISTER: The UK has been one of the countries that's been at the negotiating table with Iran for many years on its nuclear weapons program.\n\nJOURNALIST: Just to follow up. So, was your Government briefed prior to the attack?\n\nPRIME MINISTER: This was unilateral action taken by the United States.\n\nJOURNALIST: PM, you weren't briefed, is that the –?\n\nPRIME MINISTER: This was unilateral action taken by the United States.\n\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, have you spoken to President Donald Trump since the G7 summit?\n\nPRIME MINISTER: No.\n\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, you talk about Tehran coming back to the negotiating table. They were in discussions with the US 10 days ago, Israel attacked it. It actually bombed its chief negotiator. Regardless of what you think about the regime, what incentive – hasn't this blown Tehran's trust in the negotiation process? And Minister Wong, you were asked this morning whether you think these – whether Australia believes these attacks are legal under international law. Can we clarify, do you believe they were legal under international law?\n\nPRIME MINISTER: Well, Iran has an interest, an interest very clearly as well, I believe, in ensuring that there is not an escalation in the region and that is the incentive that they have. The United States have made clear their position and we continue to call for dialogue. Had Iran complied with the very reasonable requests that were made, including by the IAEA, then circumstances would have been different.\n\nJOURNALIST: PM, last year when there were strikes on the Houthis in Yemen, the Government did confirm that Australian resources were part of those strikes, that we refuelled jets and so forth. Are you saying there was absolutely no Australian involvement whatsoever – refuelling jets and nothing whatsoever?\n\nPRIME MINISTER: Well, I can't be clearer than this was unilateral action taken by the United States.\n\nJOURNALIST: Senator Wong, on your decision to withdraw our staff in the embassy in Tehran. Was that consequent out of fear for their safety, as in, were they hit by a bomb or was it their safety that there might be reprisals on the ground in Tehran against US citizens and their allies?\n\nMINISTER WONG: Thanks, Phil. Obviously, that was a difficult decision to make. We've had to do it previously, the previous Government had to do it in Kyiv and in other parts of the world. It occurs from time to time. But I would say we were very conscious of the history in Iran, which I think is – people well know. And the advice to me, which I discussed with the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister, was to ensure we got our people out. Obviously, the situation in Iran is very distressing for Australians. We have over – I think it's over 3,000 Australians and their families who have registered with us as seeking to leave and obviously airspace remains closed. We have deployed people to the Azerbaijani border in the event that more Australians are able to exit through that border.\n\nJOURNALIST: Just on the premise of the US attack – you support the US attack, but do you support the premise of the US attack, which is that Iran was imminently close to having nuclear weapons? And if so, what intelligence on that have you seen?\n\nPRIME MINISTER: Well, the information has been clear that Iran has sought to increase the grade, which had been, you know – there's no other explanation for it to reach 60 other than engaging in a program that wasn't about civilian nuclear power. And that was clear. It was also very clear over a period of time and as early as a week ago, of course, at the G7, when President Trump left the G7, made it clear that Iran had an opportunity to comply. They chose not to. And there have been consequences of that. Thanks very much."

Explosions also rang out in nearby oil-producing [Gulf Arab countries], which said they had intercepted missiles from Iran after Tehran warned it would strike the region if it was attacked.\n\nSign up [here.] \n\nThe first wave of strikes in what the Pentagon named \"OPERATION EPIC FURY\" mainly targeted Iranian officials, a source familiar with the matter said.\n\nAn Israeli official said Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Masoud Pezeshkian were both targeted but the result of the strikes was not clear. A source with knowledge of the matter had earlier told Reuters that Khamenei was not in Tehran and had been transferred to a secure location.\n\nAn Iranian source close to the establishment said several senior commanders in Iran's Revolutionary Guards and political officials had been killed. Forty people were killed in an Israeli airstrike on a school, state media said. Reuters could not independently confirm the reports.\n\n## HOPES DIM FOR DIPLOMATIC SOLUTION TO NUCLEAR DISPUTE\n\nThe renewed confrontation between Iran and its long-time foes dimmed hopes of a diplomatic solution to Tehran's nuclear dispute with the West. The latest indirect talks between the U.S. and Iran this week failed to produce a breakthrough.\n\nIran's Revolutionary Guards said all [U.S. bases] and interests in the region were within Iran's reach and that the retaliation would continue until \"the enemy is decisively defeated\".\n\nIran's foreign minister told counterparts from Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain and Iraq that Tehran would use all its defensive and military capabilities to defend itself.\n\nLoud booms sounded in the United Arab Emirates capital Abu Dhabi, an oil producer and U.S. ally. Fighter jets flew around the Yas Island area of Abu Dhabi on Saturday afternoon and blasts were heard in the country's business capital Dubai.\n\nBahrain said the service center of the U.S. Fifth Fleet had been subjected to a missile attack. Video footage from witnesses in Bahrain showed a thick grey plume of smoke rising from near the small island state's coastline as sirens wailed.\n\nFellow Gulf Arab state Qatar said it had downed all missiles targeting the country and that it had a right to respond. Sirens were later heard in its capital Doha.\n\nExplosions were heard near Iran's Kharg Island. Iran exports 90 percent of its crude oil via Kharg, for shipping through the narrow Strait of Hormuz.\n\n[Global airlines] cancelled flights across the Middle East and the attacks raised the prospect of oil prices rising.\n\n\"If we don’t see signs of de-escalation over the weekend, risk premiums could still drive Brent (crude) up by $10–$20/bbl (a barrel) on Monday,\" said Jorge Leon, head of geopolitical analysis at Rystad Energy.\n\n## TRUMP CITES 1979 HOSTAGE CRISIS\n\nItem 1 of 11 Smoke rises in the sky after blasts were heard in Manama, Bahrain, February 28, 2026.

REUTERS/Stringer [Purchase Licensing Rights, opens new tab] \n\nIn a video message published on social media, [Trump] cited Washington's decades-old dispute with Iran, including the seizure of the 1979 U.S. embassy in Tehran, when students held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days, as well as a range of other attacks the U.S. has blamed on Iran since the 1979 Islamic revolution brought the clerics to power.\n\nHe urged Iranians to stay sheltered because \"bombs will be dropping everywhere\". But he also added: \"When we are finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take. This will be probably your only chance for generations.”\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the joint U.S.-Israeli attack \"will create the conditions for the brave Iranian people to take their destiny into their own hands\" and \" remove the yoke of tyranny\". Defence Minister Israel Katz called it a pre-emptive strike to remove threats to Israel.\n\nThe scope of the U.S. air and sea operations was not immediately clear. The campaign is expected to last for multiple days, a U.S. official said.\n\nIn Tehran, witnesses said people were rushing to banks to withdraw cash. Long queues formed at gas stations across cities. Many also worried about a potential internet blackout that would cut off communication with their families abroad.\n\n“We are being killed by the regime and by Israel. We are the victims of this regime’s hostile policies,” said Maryam, 54, a [housewife in Tehran], as she headed to northern Iran with her family.\n\nIsrael's military did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the strike at a primary school for girls southern Iran, where Iranian state media reported 40 deaths.\n\nIraq's Iran-aligned armed group Kataib Hezbollah said it would soon attack U.S. bases in the region.\n\n## US MILITARY BUILDUP\n\n[Trump] had built up a vast U.S. military presence in the region to try to force Tehran to make concessions in the nuclear talks. He said the \"massive\" operation was intended to ensure Tehran does not obtain a nuclear weapon.\n\nThe U.S. and Iran renewed negotiations in February on the nuclear dispute. Iran, which denies seeking atomic bombs, said it was prepared to discuss curbs on its nuclear programme in exchange for lifting [sanctions] but ruled out linking the issue to missiles.\n\nIran's ballistic missile programme has been a significant sticking point, with Trump saying Tehran was developing long-range missiles that threaten the U.S.\n\n\"Our objective is to defend the American people by eliminating imminent threats from the Iranian regime,\" Trump said.\n\nThe attacks follows a 12-day air war last June between Israel and Iran and repeated U.S.-Israeli warnings that they would strike again if Iran pressed ahead with its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.\n\nAn Israeli defence official said the operation had been planned for months in coordination with Washington, and that the launch date was decided weeks ago.\n\nThe Israeli military announced the [closure of schools] and workplaces, with exceptions for essential sectors, and a ban on public airspace. Israel closed its airspace to civilian flights.\n\nReporting by Reuters bureaux; Writing by Michael Georgy; Editing by Barbara Lewis, Sam Holmes and Timothy Heritage\n\nOur Standards: [The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles., opens new tab] \n\n[Purchase Licensing Rights] \n\n[Alexander Cornwell] \n\nThomson Reuters\n\nAlexander has over a decade of international reporting experience.

One civilian and four soldiers were killed in the attacks, the Iranian military said.\n\nIt marks the latest in a series of attacks between the two regional foes that for months have raised fears of an all-out war.\n\nHere’s what we know.\n\n## How did the attacks unfold?\n\nAt around 02:15 on Saturday (22:45 GMT on Friday), Iranian media reported explosions in and around the capital, Tehran.\n\nVideo uploaded to social media, and verified by the BBC, showed projectiles in the sky over the city, while residents in some areas reported hearing loud booms.\n\nThe IDF's strikes, which came in several waves over a three-hour period, involved scores of aircraft, including jets and drones.\n\nTargets comprised Iran’s air defences, missile and drone production, and launch facilities. Two researchers, analysing satellite imagery, told Reuters news agency that Israel had struck buildings in Parchin, a military complex near Tehran, and may have \"significantly hampered Iran's ability to mass produce missiles\".\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - who followed the operation from the IDF’s command and control centre in Tel Aviv - said Israel had \"severely damaged Iran’s defence capability and its ability to produce missiles\".\n\n\"This regime must understand a simple principle: whoever hurts us, we hurt him,\" he added.\n\nThe White House described the strikes as an \"exercise of self-defence\". A senior administration official said the US had worked with Israel to encourage a \"targeted and proportional\" response.\n\nThey also said the attacks did not damage Iranian oil infrastructure or nuclear facilities - targets President Joe Biden had [urged Israel not to hit].\n\n## What was the scale of the attacks?\n\nIran has largely played down the impact of the strikes - which hit sites in Tehran, Khuzestan and Ilam provinces - saying most missiles were intercepted and those that were not caused \"limited damage\".\n\nBBC Verify has identified damage at a defence ministry base to the east of Tehran, and at an air defence base to the south.\n\nIranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, in [a measured response], said the attacks should not be \"exaggerated or downplayed\".\n\n\"It is up to the authorities to determine how to convey the power and will of the Iranian people to the Israeli regime,\" he said on Sunday, \"and to take actions that serve the interests of this nation and country.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the IDF said it had hit around 20 targets, with Netanyahu describing the attack as \"precise and powerful\" and having \"achieved its goals\".\n\nThe Iranian military confirmed that four soldiers had died - and state news agencies reported the death of one civilian.\n\n## Why did Israel attack Iran?\n\nIran is the primary backer of a range of groups across the Middle East - often described as proxy groups - that are hostile to Israel, including Hamas and Hezbollah, which Israel is currently at war with.\n\nIn April, Iran launched its first direct attack on Israel, with about 300 missiles and drones, in retaliation for an Israeli air [strike on an Iranian embassy compound] in Syria that killed several top commanders from Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).\n\nIsrael responded with a “limited” strike on a missile defence system in the Iranian region of Isfahan, which Iran chose not to respond to.\n\nLater, in July, Israel killed a top Hezbollah commander in an air strike on Beirut. The next day, Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an explosion in Tehran. Iran blamed Israel, though Israel did not comment.\n\nIn late September, Israel [assassinated Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah] and Brig-Gen Abbas Nilforoushan, a high-ranking Iranian official, in Beirut.\n\nOn October 1, Iran launched [about 180 ballistic missiles] at Israel, which it said was in response to the deaths of Haniyeh, Nasrallah and Nilforoushan.\n\nThis latest attack on Iran is Israel's response to that.\n\n- [Read more: Why did Israel attack Iran?] \n\n## What happens next?\n\nNetanyahu's office denied a report by US outlet Axios that prior to the attacks, Israel sent Iran a message revealing certain details about the strikes, and warning Tehran not to respond.\n\n\"Israel did not inform Iran before the attack - not about the time, not about the targets, not about the strength of the attack,\" the prime minister's spokesperson said.\n\nStill, the strikes were more limited than some had been expecting.\n\nThe IDF said in a statement that it is \"focused on our war objectives in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon. It is Iran that continues to push for a wider regional escalation\".\n\nA senior US official said \"this should be the end of this direct exchange of fire between Israel and Iran\".\n\nIran’s foreign ministry said it was \"entitled and obligated to defend itself\" and described the attack as a violation of international law.\n\nBut it also said that Tehran recognises its \"responsibilities towards regional peace and security\".\n\n## What has been happening inside Iran?\n\nImages published by Iranian state media over the weekend showed life continuing in relative normality - with busy streets, people exercising in parks, and fruit and vegetable markets open as usual.\n\nIran closed its airspace for a few hours, but it later reopened.\n\nThere are, however, signs that the Iranian government is keen to play down the impact of the attacks.\n\nThe IRGC has announced that it is a criminal offense to send “images or news” related to the attack to outlets that it deems \"Israel-affiliated\" or \"hostile”. Usually, Iran refers to Western media as hostile.\n\nIranian media reported over the weekend that Tehran's Prosecutor Office has filed charges against an unnamed website for “covering issues counter to national security\".\n\n## How has the world responded?\n\nUS National Security Council spokesman Sean Savett said Israel’s response “avoided populated areas and focused solely on military targets, contrary to Iran's attack against Israel that targeted Israel's most populous city\".\n\nBut Washington’s aim, he added, is “to accelerate diplomacy and de-escalate tensions in the Middle East region\".\n\nUK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said Israel had the right to defend itself, but urged all sides to “show restraint” and called for Iran not to respond.\n\nSaudi Arabia condemned the attack, and warned against any action that \"threatens the security and the stability” of the region.\n\nEgypt's foreign ministry echoed those concerns, saying it was “gravely concerned” by the strikes.\n\nHamas described them as \"a flagrant violation of Iranian sovereignty, and an escalation that targets the security of the region and the safety of its peoples\".\n\nAdditional reporting by Ghoncheh Habibiazad, BBC Monitoring\n\nMore on this story\n\n## Strikes on Iran suggest Israel may have heeded US warnings\n\n## Middle East conflict: How will it end?\n\n## Israel says it launched 'targeted' air strikes on Iran\n\n[Middle East] \n\n[Israel] \n\n[Hezbollah] \n\n[Lebanon] \n\n[Iran] \n\n---"

One civilian and four soldiers were killed in the attacks, the Iranian military said.\nIt marks the latest in a series of attacks between the two regional foes that for months have raised fears of an all-out war.\nHere’s what we know.\n## How did the attacks unfold?\nAt around 02:15 on Saturday (22:45 GMT on Friday), Iranian media reported explosions in and around the capital, Tehran.\nVideo uploaded to social media, and verified by the BBC, showed projectiles in the sky over the city, while residents in some areas reported hearing loud booms.\nThe IDF&#x27;s strikes, which came in several waves over a three-hour period, involved scores of aircraft, including jets and drones.\nTargets comprised Iran’s air defences, missile and drone production, and launch facilities. Two researchers, analysing satellite imagery, told Reuters news agency that Israel had struck buildings in Parchin, a military complex near Tehran, and may have &quot;significantly hampered Iran&#x27;s ability to mass produce missiles&quot;.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - who followed the operation from the IDF’s command and control centre in Tel Aviv - said Israel had &quot;severely damaged Iran’s defence capability and its ability to produce missiles&quot;.\n&quot;This regime must understand a simple principle: whoever hurts us, we hurt him,&quot; he added.\nThe White House described the strikes as an &quot;exercise of self-defence&quot;. A senior administration official said the US had worked with Israel to encourage a &quot;targeted and proportional&quot; response.\nThey also said the attacks did not damage Iranian oil infrastructure or nuclear facilities - targets President Joe Biden had[urged Israel not to hit].\n## What was the scale of the attacks?\nIran has largely played down the impact of the strikes - which hit sites in Tehran, Khuzestan and Ilam provinces - saying most missiles were intercepted and those that were not caused &quot;limited damage&quot;.\nBBC Verify has identified damage at a defence ministry base to the east of Tehran, and at an air defence base to the south.\nIranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, in[a measured response], said the attacks should not be &quot;exaggerated or downplayed&quot;.\n&quot;It is up to the authorities to determine how to convey the power and will of the Iranian people to the Israeli regime,&quot; he said on Sunday, &quot;and to take actions that serve the interests of this nation and country.&quot;\nMeanwhile, the IDF said it****had hit around 20 targets, with Netanyahu describing the attack as &quot;precise and powerful&quot; and having &quot;achieved its goals&quot;.\nThe Iranian military confirmed that four soldiers had died - and state news agencies reported the death of one civilian.\n![A map of Iran and the wider Middle East, showing Ilam, Khuzestan and Tehran. ] \n## Why did Israel attack Iran?\nIran is the primary backer of a range of groups across the Middle East - often described as proxy groups - that are hostile to Israel, including Hamas and Hezbollah, which Israel is currently at war with.\nIn April, Iran launched its first direct attack on Israel, with about 300 missiles and drones, in retaliation for an Israeli air[strike on an Iranian embassy compound,external] in Syria that killed several top commanders from Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).\nIsrael responded with a “limited” strike on a missile defence system in the Iranian region of Isfahan, which Iran chose not to respond to.\nLater, in July, Israel killed a top Hezbollah commander in an air strike on Beirut. The next day, Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an explosion in Tehran. Iran blamed Israel, though Israel did not comment.\nIn late September, Israel[assassinated Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah] and Brig-Gen Abbas Nilforoushan, a high-ranking Iranian official, in Beirut.\nOn October 1, Iran launched[about 180 ballistic missiles] at Israel, which it said was in response to the deaths of Haniyeh, Nasrallah and Nilforoushan.\nThis latest attack on Iran is Israel&#x27;s response to that.\n* [Read more: Why did Israel attack Iran?] \n## What happens next?\nNetanyahu&#x27;s office denied a report by US outlet Axios that prior to the attacks, Israel sent Iran a message revealing certain details about the strikes, and warning Tehran not to respond.\n&quot;Israel did not inform Iran before the attack - not about the time, not about the targets, not about the strength of the attack,&quot; the prime minister&#x27;s spokesperson said.\nStill, the strikes were more limited than some had been expecting.\nThe IDF said in a statement that it is &quot;focused on our war objectives in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon. It is Iran that continues to push for a wider regional escalation&quot;.\nA senior US official said &quot;this should be the end of this direct exchange of fire between Israel and Iran&quot;.\nIran’s foreign ministry said it was &quot;entitled and obligated to defend itself&quot; and described the attack as a violation of international law.\nBut it also said that Tehran recognises its &quot;responsibilities towards regional peace and security&quot;.\n## What has been happening inside Iran?\nImages published by Iranian state media over the weekend showed life continuing in relative normality - with busy streets, people exercising in parks, and fruit and vegetable markets open as usual.\nIran closed its airspace for a few hours, but it later reopened.\nThere are, however, signs that the Iranian government is keen to play down the impact of the attacks.\nThe IRGC has announced that it is a criminal offense to send “images or news” related to the attack to outlets that it deems &quot;Israel-affiliated&quot; or &quot;hostile”. Usually, Iran refers to Western media as hostile.\nIranian media reported over the weekend that Tehran&#x27;s Prosecutor Office has filed charges against an unnamed website for “covering issues counter to national security&quot;.\n## How has the world responded?\nUS National Security Council spokesman Sean Savett said Israel’s response “avoided populated areas and focused solely on military targets, contrary to Iran&#x27;s attack against Israel that targeted Israel&#x27;s most populous city&quot;.\nBut Washington’s aim, he added, is “to accelerate diplomacy and de-escalate tensions in the Middle East region&quot;.\nUK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said Israel had the right to defend itself, but urged all sides to “show restraint” and called for Iran not to respond.\nSaudi Arabia condemned the attack, and warned against any action that &quot;threatens the security and the stability” of the region.\nEgypt&#x27;s foreign ministry echoed those concerns, saying it was “gravely concerned” by the strikes.\nHamas described them as &quot;a flagrant violation of Iranian sovereignty, and an escalation that targets the security of the region and the safety of its peoples&quot;.\n*Additional reporting by Ghoncheh Habibiazad, BBC Monitoring*\n## Related topics\n* [Middle East] \n* [Israel] \n* [Hezbollah] \n* [Lebanon] \n* [Iran] \n## More on this story\n* [\nStrikes on Iran suggest Israel may have heeded US warnings\n] \n* Published\n26 October 2024\n![Benjamin Netanyahu and Joe Biden shake hands] \n* [\nMiddle East conflict: How will it end?\n] \n* Published\n8 October 2024\n![Two women, their faces etched in grief] \n* [\nIsrael says it launched &#x27;targeted&#x27; air strikes on Iran\n] \n* Published\n26 October 2024\n![Tehran at sunrise on Saturday morning, following Israeli strikes on sites around the Iranian capital] \n## Top stories\n* [Live.\nFestival organisers &#x27;heartbroken&#x27; as Vancouver car ramming attack kills 11\n] \n* 11015 viewing11k viewing\n* [\n&#x27;Our community is grieving,&#x27; say Vancouver festival organisers\n] \n* Published\n23 minutes ago\n* [\nVictim hurt in attack involving crossbow &#x27;stable&#x27;\n] \n* Published\n41 minutes ago\n## More to explore\n* [\nHow the next Pope is chosen\n] \n![A designed / photoshopped image depicting: The roof of St Peter&#x27;s Basilica (with a red image overlay) some cardinals chatting (in black and white) and in the foreground there is a Pope whose back is turned to the camera.

The government has always supported Israel’s right to security –and had grave concerns about Iran’s nuclear programme, he says.\nBut he calls on all sides to show restraint. Healey says a diplomatic resolution rather than military action was the only route to a lasting peace.\nThe defence secretary says additional military assets has been arriving in the region –including extra Typhoon jets at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus. It was a response to protect UK military personnel in the region - who are now on high alert. The move was to reinforce security.\nAsked whether he was concerned the US might join Israel’s attacks on Iran –with more US jets also being sent to the region, Healey says President Trump has been leading the calls for Tehran to do a deal.\nHe describes the increased UK and US military posture as reinforcing the messages to Iran that the diplomatic route is the way to settle the situation.\nShare\nclose panel\nShare page\nCopy link\n[About sharing] \n2. ### Iran warns residents of Tel Aviv and Haifa to evacuate &#x27;to save their lives&#x27;published at 18:35 British Summer Time\n18:35 BST\n**Ghoncheh Habibiazad**\nBBC Persian\nIran&#x27;s Armed Forces chief of staff says in a video message posted by\nIranian outlets to the residents of Israel that &quot;especially Tel Aviv and Haifa need to evacuate as soon as possible to save\ntheir lives&quot;.\nMajor General Abdolrahim Mousavi also says that the &quot;operations carried\nout so far have been a warning for deterrence&quot;, and a &quot;punitive operation&quot; by Iran &quot;will be carried out soon&quot;.\nAlthough Iranian\nattacks have killed at least 24 Israelis since Friday, most Iranian missiles\nhave been stopped by Israel’s air defence systems.\nShare\nclose panel\nShare page\nCopy link\n[About sharing] \n3. ### US National Security Council meeting to begin soonpublished at 18:29 British Summer Time\n18:29 BST\n![] **Bernd Debusmann Jr**\nReporting from the White House\nPresident Trump is expected to meet with his National Security Council shortly, according to the White House.\nNo further details were immediately available.\nShare\nclose panel\nShare page\nCopy link\n[About sharing] \n4. ### Anti-war sentiment crops up on Truth Socialpublished at 18:20 British Summer Time\n18:20 BST\n![] **Bernd Debusmann Jr**\nReporting from the White House\nOn Truth Social - a platform whose users are, unsurprisingly, generally supportive of Donald Trump - anti-war sentiment is increasingly evident in the comments.\nSome of the comments appear to come from Trump&#x27;s MAGA base, to whom he previously pledged to avoid foreign entanglements and foreign wars after decades of messy US interventions in the Middle East and Afghanistan.\n&quot;No war with Iran. No more foreign wars,&quot; one user wrote. &quot;America first!&quot;\nAnother user warned that US involvement in Israeli operations could cost the Republicans politically in the years ahead.\n&quot;Don&#x27;t do this,&quot; the user wrote. &quot;Republicans will never win again if you do this.&quot;\nThe posts are anonymous, and there is no way to ascertain how widespread this sentiment is among the president&#x27;s supporters.\nThe last few days, however, have seen a growing schism among Republicans, pitting the &quot;MAGA&quot; wing of the party - such as Marjorie Taylor Greene - against Iran hawks that would like to see the US take action against Iran and help Israel.\nShare\nclose panel\nShare page\nCopy link\n[About sharing] \n5. ### Reports of significant slowdown in Iranian internet servicespublished at 18:08 British Summer Time\n18:08 BST\n**Soroush Negahdari, BBC Monitoring, and Ghoncheh Habibiazad, BBC Persian**\nWe&#x27;re hearing reports from Iranians across the country - including in Tehran,\nGilan, Mazandaran, Isfahan and Khuzestan provinces - of a significant\nslowdown in internet connectivity.\nInternet tracking service Netblocks is now showing a significant reduction in internet traffic in Iran.\nMajor social media websites, messaging platforms and streaming\nservices are blocked in Iran, but people in the country use VPNs to circumvent\nthe ban.\nSome say they are unable to access VPN services, further limiting\ntheir ability to use social media to connect with friends and family and gather\nupdates amid minimised reporting by state media on Israeli strikes.\nFrom what we have observed on Telegram groups, people are sending\nVPN links to each other or asking others to download offline maps in case the\ninternet goes down completely.\nAuthorities lifted a longstanding ban on WhatsApp in December, but\nusers now report access has been restricted again\nin some areas.\nState TV has warned about using foreign social media apps,\nincluding WhatsApp.\nGovernment spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani today described the\nsituation as a &quot;hybrid war&quot; and warned citizens against “enemy\npsychological warfare” and rumours online.\nMohajerani confirmed yesterday that the authorities have slowed\ndown the internet to “combat cyber-attacks”.

He wanted the residents of Tehran to “be safe”. He wanted more than a ceasefire, he wanted a “real end” to the conflict - one that could include a complete Iranian “give-up”.\nI asked him what he could do in Washington that he couldn&#x27;t in Canada, and he said he preferred not to conduct sensitive business by telephone. And he told us he wasn’t in the “much in the mood” to negotiate with Iran now.\nEarlier in the day Trump said he thought Israel is winning its war with Iran. If that&#x27;s the case, perhaps Trump&#x27;s main goal is to be around to accept Iran’s eventual surrender.\nThe US could try to hasten that along, such as by providing Israel high-powered ‘bunker-busting” bombs to hit Iranian nuclear research targets or ordering such strikes with American warplanes. The president didn’t offer any indication that this was a possibility, however - and such an escalation could further destabilise the region.\nThroughout Monday, Trump hinted that something was going to happen - or change - once he returned to Washington.\n“I think a deal will be signed, or something will happen,” he told reporters as he stood outside with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. “As soon as I leave you, we’re going to be doing something.&quot;\nTrump has left Canada - and the waiting for what that “something” is begins in earnest.\nShare\nclose panel\nShare page\nCopy link\n[About sharing] \n7. ![Analysis] ### Will the US join in?published at 17:48 British Summer Time\n17:48 BST\n![] **Frank Gardner**\nSecurity correspondent\n![A B2 Spirit bomber in flight (file photo)] Image source,USAF\nImage caption,\nA B-2 Spirit bomber in flight (file photo)\nThis is the 30,000lb question. Because that, (13,600kg), is the tonnage of the weapon that would be needed to reach some of Iran’s most secretive and valuable nuclear apparatus, buried 90m (295ft) deep under a mountain in a place called Fordow.\nThe weapon, to give it its full name, is the GBU-57 MOP, standing for Massive Ordnance Penetrator and it can hit targets as deep as 61m underground, or deeper with repeated strikes.\nThe US has it, Israel does not.\nAlmost the only aircraft configured to carry this massive but non-nuclear bomb is the USAF B-2 Spirit bomber, which can carry two at a time.\nThese aircraft are currently believed to be stationed on the Indian Ocean US-British base at Diego Garcia, 2,358 miles (3,796km) from Iran and well within the B-2 range.\nThere is also a US Navy Carrier Strike Group heading for the region, led by the USS Nimitz aircraft carrier.\nSo if Israel is to destroy Iran’s capacity to build a nuclear weapon, it needs to deal with Fordow.\nIt can’t do that from the air but the US could, if it chose. An Israeli commando raid is one, extremely risky, option.\nBut for now, a lot of people will be watching the US military build-up in the region and asking: is this a bluff to pressure Tehran into a deal or is America going to join in this fight, despite President Trump’s aversion to wars?\nShare\nclose panel\nShare page\nCopy link\n[About sharing] \n8. ### While Trump posts, an uneasy calm at the White Housepublished at 17:39 British Summer Time\n17:39 BST\n![] **Bernd Debusmann Jr**\nReporting from the White House\n![Exterior of the West Wing of the White House] Image source,Bernd Debusmann Jr/BBC News\nWhile Trump is posting a flurry of messages to Truth Social, things are quiet at the White House.

I also just went up to the White House offices to ask in person, but saw mostly closed doors and empty chairs.\nThe only activity here is, at the moment, TV reporters working outside, plus a handful of reporters inside clacking away on keyboards. But by the standards of this White House, it&#x27;s by no means busy.\nTrump was not supposed to be back at the White House until midnight tonight, but ended up cutting his trip to Canada short to return to Washington amid the Israel-Iran fighting.\nShare\nclose panel\nShare page\nCopy link\n[About sharing] \n9. ### &#x27;Unconditional surrender&#x27; Trump says after posts about Iranpublished at 17:31 British Summer Time\n17:31 BST\nWe&#x27;ve just had the third post from the US president in quick succession, in which he says: &quot;UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER!&quot;\nIn the previous two, Trump had said &quot;we now have complete and total control of the skies over Iran&quot;, and claimed to know where the Iranian leader is, saying: &quot;We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now&quot;.\nShare\nclose panel\nShare page\nCopy link\n[About sharing] \n10. ### Trump: We know where Iranian leader is but won&#x27;t kill him, for nowpublished at 17:25 British Summer Time\n17:25 BSTBreaking\nDonald Trump has just posted a follow up on social media.\nHe says: &quot;We know exactly where the so-called &#x27;Supreme Leader&#x27; is hiding.\n&quot;He is an easy target, but is safe there - We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now.\n&quot;But we don’t want missiles shot at civilians, or American soldiers.

Even now I can’t believe the ignorance and recklessness of this regime has brought us to this point.”\n“The shadow of war and bombing is terrifying,” she says. “But honestly, now that we’ve come this far, I’m just praying that at the very least, they take out the head of the snake.

The source given is a Fox News article titled \"Israel calls up 70,000 reservists after Iran missile response escalates.\" \n\nFirst, I need to parse the source material effectively. The article mentions Israel mobilizing reservists in response to Iran's missile actions. From a Right-leaning viewpoint, this would likely emphasize Iran's aggression, the threat to Israel and U.S. interests, and the necessity of a strong military response.\n\nNext, I should identify key terms. Terms like \"Axis of Resistance\" come up in the Atlantic Council source, which is mentioned in the user's provided sources. Right perspectives often highlight Iran's support for proxy groups. Terms like \"Ballistic Missiles\" and \"Nuclear Ambitions\" are central because they relate to Iran's military capabilities and perceived threats. \"Proxy Warfare\" is another term tied to Iran's strategy in the Middle East.\n\nLooking at the claims or findings, the sources mention Iran's missile capabilities surpassing pre-war levels (from Fox News), U.S.-Israel joint operations (CNN), and Iran's nuclear advancements (Atlantic Council). These points align with a Right narrative stressing the need for military preparedness and proactive strikes.\n\nFor citations, I need to reference the provided sources. The Fox News article about missile power, CNN's mention of \"Operation Epic Fury,\" and the Atlantic Council's analysis of Israel's calculus are all relevant. Each citation should link back to the terms and claims, ensuring they support the Right perspective's emphasis on threat and necessary military action.\n\nConfidence notes should acknowledge that the analysis is based solely on the provided sources, which are from major journalism outlets. There might be limitations due to the absence of primary military data or Iranian perspectives, but the focus is on the Right's interpretation as presented in these sources.\n\nI need to structure the JSON correctly, ensuring all required fields are present. Terms should be ordered by centrality, with the highest first. Each citation must include the URL, title, publisher, date (if available), a relevant quote or paraphrase, and link to supporting terms. The confidence notes should mention the reliance on major journalism sources and potential biases.\n\nLastly, verify that all URLs from the provided sources are accurately included. For example, the Fox News URL about Iran's missile claims is present in the user's sources, as is the CNN article on Trump's announcement.

And whereas the US strikes in June were over within a few hours, sources have told CNN that the US military is this time planning for several days of attacks.\nIn response, the Iranian regime has launched an unprecedented wave of strikes across the Middle East, with blasts heard in several countries that host US military bases, including the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Bahrain.\nHere’s what we know about the first few hours of what could be a longer regional war.\n##\nWhat did Trump say?\nIn his 2.30 a.m. statement, Trump said the objective of the US operation – which the Department of Defense is calling [“Operation Epic Fury”] – is “to defend the American people by eliminating imminent threats from the Iranian regime.”\nThe president listed the Iranian regime’s long history of sponsoring terror in the region and hostility toward the US, from the 1979 hostage crisis to the more recent actions of its proxies.\n“For 47 years the Iranian regime has chanted “death to America” and waged an unending campaign of bloodshed and mass murder, targeting the United States, our troops, and the innocent people in many, many countries,” Trump said. “It’s been mass terror. And we’re not going to put up with it any longer.”\n![People run for cover following an explosion in Tehran, on Saturday, February 28.] \nPeople run for cover following an explosion in Tehran, on Saturday, February 28.\nMajid Asgaripour/West Asia News Agency/Reuters\n##\nWhy is the US launching military action?\nTrump said Iran had “rejected every opportunity to renounce their nuclear ambitions,” which had prompted the US to take military action.\nThe strikes come just hours after Oman’s foreign minister, who has been mediating the talks between US and Iranian officials, said the two sides had made “significant progress” during the latest round of negotiations.\nTrump also claimed that Iran’s ballistic missile program could threaten America’s security. He said the US would “destroy their missiles and raze their missile industry to the ground.” He also claimed the US will “annihilate” Iran’s navy.\n##\nWhat did Trump say to the Iranian people?\nAt the end of his video, Trump called on the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), the elite wing of the regime’s military, to lay down its arms and enjoy “complete immunity,” or “face certain death.” Since the US attacks have been from the air, rather than the ground, it was not clear to whom the IRGC would surrender.\nHe also addressed the Iranian people directly, saying: “When we are finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take. This will be, probably, your only chance for generations. For many years you have asked for America’s help, but you never got it. No president was willing to do what I am willing to do tonight. Now you have a president who is giving you what you want. So let’s see how you respond.”\n##\nWhat has the US hit?\n[Explosions] were heard in [Tehran’s] Pasteur district, where the highly secure compound housing the residence and office of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is located, Iranian state-affiliated news outlets said.\nExplosions have also been heard in several other Iranian cities but the extent of the damage or if any senior officials were killed is still being determined.\n##\nHow has Iran responded?\nIran has retaliated with an unprecedented wave of strikes across the Middle East, targeting several nearby countries that host US military bases, as well as Israel.\nBlasts have been heard from the beaches of Dubai to the streets of Doha. It was not immediately clear if those explosions were the sound of missiles being intercepted, or hitting their targets.\nWhat is clear, however, is that Iran is responding quickly and aggressively to the US and Israeli strikes. When the US and Israel last struck Iran in June, they targeted its stockpile of ballistic missiles, hampering its ability to retaliate. Iran could be trying to make use of its arsenal while it still has it.\nThe Middle East\nDonald Trump\n[\nSee all topics\n] \nFacebook\nTweet\n[\nEmail\n] \nLink\nThreads\nLink Copied!\nFollow\nAd Feedback\nAd Feedback\nAd Feedback\n## Download the CNN app\nScan the QR code to download the CNN app on Google Play.\n## Download the CNN app\nScan the QR code to download the CNN app from the Apple Store."

Today we have a lots of very interesting updates. So let's start and first we're going to talk about the Middle East because it seems that the military operation against Iran is imminent.\nDuring the previous 24 hours, we received a lots of updates from this area that were telling us just about one thing that something big is going to happen most likely within the next 72 hours. For example, China's embassy in Israel has urged its citizens in the country to be highly vigilant, strengthen security precautions, and improve their emergency preparedness.\nFurthermore, the US embassy also made a statement. US ambassador urged staff in an internal email to deport today while commercial flights are still available.\nFurthermore, according to information we have, the US Jello air for aircraft carrier and its strike group have arrived up the coast of Israel, which means that everything is ready to begin the military operation. Another important thing is that the United States of America have evacuated the Navy's fifth fleet headquarters in Bahrain. According to information we have, the headquarters in Bahrain has been reduced to mission critical staffing fewer than 100 personnel. As you can see, this base is located very close to Iran. So, the United States of America did that to avoid unnecessary casualties and to avoid strikes uh from the territory of Iran. Furthermore, according to information we have, we have a satellite picture of approximate position of US Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier to the south of Iran. And according to information we have this aircraft carrier is located approximately 780 km from Iran. So as you can see everything is ready and once again most likely within the next 72 hours something big is going to happen and everything what we see what we can see right now is happening because Iran according to information we have rejected everything from the US side.\nIran has rejected all American demands in the Geneva nuclear talks Wall Street Journal. The US delegation led by Sitkov and Jared Kushner presented Iran with the following demands. Destroy three pre primary nuclear facilities Faro Natans and Isvahan. Transfer all remaining enriched uranium to the United States.\nHold all uranium enrichment permanently.\nAccept a permanent agreement with no expiration date. and everything was rejected as we can see. So most likely something big is going to happen.\nFurthermore, during the previous 24 hours, we start receiving a lots of updates from the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan. During the previous 24 hours, a lots of videos were published of how the Pakistanis were attacking the capital Afghanistan Kabul with bombs. Uh we received a lots of videos of clashes along the border. We received lots of videos of how the Pakistanis and the Afghanistanis were fighting with each other and we see that something tell we see that this conflict is not also is not going to stop within the next days.\nmost likely the conflict will continue and as you can see uh the state of Afghanistan is located to the east of the state of Iran and it seems that these things that are currently happening along the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan are tightly connected with the situation in Iran. A lots of things might happen in this area. So let's wait and see.\nNow let's discuss the situation in Ukraine. According to information we have during the previous 24 hours, the Ukrainians once again launched significant number of drones and missiles deep inside of the territory of the Russian Federation. The Ukrainians and pro Ukrainian sources yesterday and today published a lot of maps where we could see the approximate roads of their drones and the Russians were repelling these attacks. Several waves of drones were flying in the direction of the capital of the Russian Federation and those waves were repelled by Russians and the sources reported that Russians destroyed around 250 drones that were flying in the direction of the of Moscow and in the northern direction.\nThis morning the Ukrainians launched another wave of attack and this time the Ukrainians were attacking in the direction of the southern regions of Russia and in the direction of the central part of Russia. The Russians stated that during the nightsh they managed to destroy up to 95 drones and late in the morning the Russians reported that they managed to destroy a few more drones flying in the central part of Russia and in the southern regions. And this map was published by pro Ukrainian sources this morning. And here we can see green arrows which means that Ukrainians launched up to 10 flamingo missiles deep inside of the church of Russia. and pro-Russian sources and pro Ukrainian sources reported that these flamingo drones were launched from the Nepropet region and they were moving in the direction of the central part of Russia and the sources pro Ukrainian sources somewhere at noon time published this picture where we can see the approximate roads of these flamingo missiles as you can see according to information we have the flamingo missiles managed to approach the city of Kazan the city of Yikatinborg and the settlement of Nishnagil.\nIf we calculate the distance, let's say between the city of Nishnagil and the border and the Netros region according to approximate roads of these missiles, we can say that these drones managed to cross around 2,000 kilometers, which is a very big distance for these missiles.\nAccording to information we have, the Ukrainians haven't damaged anything in this area. It seems that the Ukrainians were testing their missiles capabilities and now they understand what exactly these missiles are are able to do. At the same time, we start receiving reports from the shi of course the sources reported that the Ukrainians attacked the territory of the city and a lot of as you can see and they managed to deal some damage to some parking position. We see that a lot of vehicles as you can see were destroyed most likely as a result of attack of a drone or of a missile and the sources reported that there were casualties among civilians. The Russians from their side carried out another massive drone attack through the inside chain and Ukrainian stated that during the night they managed to bring down 187 drones. Uh the Russians launched 187 drones and Ukrainians managed to bring down 165.\nThe Russians were attacking uh through the entire tit lots of explosions, lots of updates. We received from the shi of Adessa. We received updates from the settlement of Ismael. The Russians attacked the shi of new pro. Lots of videos were published from this area.\nAnd it seems that the Russians destroyed an ammo depot. The Russians attacked the city of Hark. Lots of abdes came from this area as well. And the Russians attacked the city of Sum. And of course the Russians attacked the city of Chernigov. Also an explosion was recorded in this area. So based on these updates we see that neither the Russians nor the Ukrainians are ready for the negotiation process and nobody is going to step back. Russia is detecting that uh preparations for sabotage on the Turkish and blue streams. Information about Ke's intention to attack the Turkish and blue streams was conveyed on Karapiskov said. So according to the Russian intelligence, the Ukrainians are planning to attack pipelines that goes through the back Black Sea. And today we start receiving reports that a Royal Air Force Riv joint electronic reconnaissance aircraft is currently conducting surveillance along the Black Sea coast of Crimea and the Kasnod.\nMaybe the Ukrainians are gathering intelligence information from the city of Novarisk. Or maybe this is already the preparation of attack on these pipelines that goes that go from the territory of Russia in the direction of Turkey. So everything is possible and something big might happen on the territory of Black Sea as well. Another important statement was made by the president of Ukraine Zilinski during the previous 24 hours. He said that right now I think we have a chance. It depends on these next few months whether we'll be will be able to end the war by the fall before the elections important influential elections in the US if we can achieve peace. We have that window now. So Zilinski is trying to tell us that he's waiting for the midterm elections in the United States of America and he hopes that the Democrats will win the elections and they will return to the Congress. We're talking about 51% of the seats. If it happens, of course, Linskands that he will get or he will start receiving a lots of money even this year and most likely during the 2027, which means that the conflict could be prolonged for another year very easily.\nNow, let's discuss the situation on the ground. During the previous 24 hours, we received a lots of important updates.\nAnd first let's talk about the Zaparoi direction where the Russians continue their offensive operation. As you can see during the previous night we received a lots of videos around the sh of which means that the Russians are paying attention to this area. The Russians are attacking artillery forces artillery positions with drone operators positions with drones with lanced drones and so on. So a lots of updates were published during the previous 24 hours of how Russians are preparing this foothold before a major offensive operation.\nAnd we have changes on the ground.\nDuring the previous uh 12 hours, the map has been adjusted. This is the situation by the end of the 26th of February. And this is the situation by the end of the 27th of February of 2026. As you can see, the Russians managed to establish complete control over this territory.\nAnd we came to this conclusion based on the video that was published by pro- Ukrainian sources. We have a lots of episodes of how Ukrainians were attacking positions of the armored force of the Russian Federation along these let's say railways along this line.\nBased on this video once again the map has been adjusted. This is the end of the 26 and this is the uh big end of the 27th.\nFurthermore, according to information we have, the Ukrainians indeed managed to improve their positions in the northern parts in the northern flank of the Zaparoi direction. The map has been adjusted as you can see significantly and uh the map has been adjusted based on the videos that were published by pro-Russian sources. In this video, we can see how Russians were attacking positions of the armored force with FPV drones along the tree line. Also we have a video where we can see how Russians were attacking vehicles and infantry of the armored force to Ukraine between the settlements of Berizov and Tinoa. So based on these videos we have adjusted the map and we see that the Ukrainians are trying to improve their positions.\nUh the Russians are saying that uh they confirm that there are very heavy clashes but the Russians are saying that there are Ukrainians but they're not controlling the settlements. So that is why the Russians are counteratt attacking with the purpose to restore control over the territory and to force the Koreans to fall back.\nNow let's move further and let's discuss the situation in the area of the city of the settlement of Moravka. Pro-Russian sources and the minister of defense of the Russian Federation during the previous 24 hours reported that the Russians as a result of clashes established complete control over the settlement by the name of Bilakavka.\nBased on the report published by the Ministry of Defense, we have adjusted the map. So this is the end of the 25th of February and this is the end of the 27th of February. The Russians, as you can see, managed to take on the complete control of this territory and this is a very important settlement despite the fact that the village is very small because the village is located on the Ukrainian side of the river of Salona.\nSo from these positions most likely the Russians will try to continue offensive operation further in the western direction with the purpose to attack the settlement of Nova Pavlovka from behind.\nFurthermore during the previous days additional changes on the ground were recorded around the settlement of Muladeska. These are the changes on the ground. It seems that the Russians are keeping advancing in this area as well with the purpose to establish control over the settlements of Kona Majoua. And it seems that these changes are the part of the Majoua offensive operation. The city of Mizova is a very important logistical city in this area logistical hub. Russians if the Russians are able to establish complete control over the territory, this can lead to the situation when Ukrainians would be forced to change their plans regarding both the Zaparoia offensive operation and the uh Pavlo defense operation. So this is already at the beginning of the new Petrolovsk offensive operation and we see that the Russians are keeping advancing.\nNow let's move further and let's discuss the situation in the Constantine of Kadervak. During the previous 24 hours, we received a lots of videos from the most southern parts of the settlement. A lots of attacks, lots of explosions were recorded. The Russians are keeping advancing. The Ukrainians are showing fierce resistance and we see that Ukrainians are not planning to fall back from this territory. So there are very heavy clashes and we have small changes that were provided by neutral mappers.\nSo these are the changes on the ground between the dates. The Russians continue improving their positions in the southern part of the city, but once again the Ukrainians are showing fierce resistance.\nAs for the Slavven's direction, we received lots of updates from this area.\nWe received lots of updates from pro-Russian sources. There are very heavy clashes, but the previous 24 hours haven't brought us almost anything. Just small correction of the map to the southeast of the settlement of Ry Alexandraka. These are the changes on the ground between the dates.\nNow let's move further and let's discuss the situation in the settlement of Dushawa. Today ProRussian sources published this video where we can see the Russian flag in the central part of the settlement. Several pro Russian sources stated that this flag was raided by pro by a Russian soldier. But when talking about this video we haven't seen even a single soldier in this area. So as of now uh we have this episode, we have this video but we are not going to adjust the map because uh there are very high chances that the flag could be established by a Russian drone. So that is why we're not going to change anything but uh in coming days we might receive additional updates and additional changes on the ground and then we will adjust everything. But one thing is clear that if indeed the Russians as a result of offensive operation establish control over the central part of the settlement of Dasha then we can say that this is something like a turning point in the battle for the settlement and the Russians most likely will finish the battle for the rest of the settlement in coming days.\nNow let's talk about the northern directions. The most interesting updates are coming from the area of the Shichi of Gulov in the most northern parts of the Sumi region. Today, several pro-Russian independent sources stated that as a result of clashes, the Amit force of the Russian Federation established complete control over the settlement by the name of Soich, which is located along the border with the Russian Federation. We think that during the next days both the minister of defense of the Russian Federation and pro Ukraine mappers will confirm this information and then we will adjust the map but as of now we will keep an eye on this area. I would like to remind you that during the January and February of 2026 the Russians improved their position significantly to the south of the settlement of uh so the Russians captured at least four villages along the border. the village of Kharkf Kakamarov Bir and Cidarovka. And now we see that the Russians opened the second front line in this area. And now according if this information of course is correct, according to these updates, we can say that most likely the Russians are tasked to establish complete control over this small pocket which will allow the Russians to continue advancing further deep inside of the Sumu region of its northern part with the purpose to force Ukrainians to fall back from the northeastern pocket of the Cherniggo and Sumu regions. Because I would like to remind you that the Ukrainians are using this territory as a launching site to attack deep inside of the territory of Russia with missiles and drones. And this is the vital question for the Russians to take this ter complete control. Otherwise, Ukrainians will be always be able to threaten the city of Moscow, the capital of the Russian Federation. And everything is possible.\nAnd I would like to remind you that once again, Ukrainians are using this the Flamingo missile more and more often.\nAnd who's who knows uh how the Ukrainians are going to use this missile if they decide to attack in the direction of the capital of Russia.\nEverything is possible.\nAnd that's it for today. The military with summary channel reminds us to we condemn any violence in the world. Thank you for your watching. Subscribe to my channel. Put your likes. Join my patre and have a good day. Bye-bye."

                    "content": "Twenty questions (and expert answers) on the Israel-Iran war - Atlantic Council\n\nA decades-old conflict between Israel and Iran that was never quite “cold” is rapidly heating up. In the days since the first Israeli attacks against the Iranian nuclear program and military leadership, more than two hundred people have been [killed] in Iran and at least two dozen have died in Israel. The escalating war raises all sorts of questions, from military mechanics to humanitarian efforts to Washington diplomacy and the global energy supply. Below, the Atlantic Council’s authorities on the Middle East unpack this increasingly volatile moment for the region. Read on for expert responses to twenty pressing questions on this emerging war.\n\n### 1. What was the Israeli calculus in launching Friday’s strikes against Iran?\n\nIsrael recognized a golden opportunity to seize Iranian weakness, following the collapse of is proxy “Axis of Resistance” led by Hezbollah along with Israel’s operational achievements of its October 2024 attack on Iran, when Israel destroyed Tehran’s strategic air defense system. The fact that the path to Iran was open to the Israeli Air Force was a significant factor in the decision to launch the attack, especially as Iran was advancing dangerously in its enrichment program. In addition, Israel recently received intelligence that Iran had resumed its “weapons group” activity in pursuit of a nuclear weapon. The combination of a country on the verge of military enrichment and an active weapons group was too dangerous in the eyes of Israel, which sought to exploit the operational window of opportunity and attack Iran as soon as it received the green light from US President Donald Trump.— [Danny Citrinowicz] is a nonresident fellow with the Atlantic Council’s Middle East Programs. He previously served for twenty-five years in a variety of command positions units in Israel Defense Intelligence, including as the head of the Iran branch in the Research and Analysis Division.\n\n### 2. How effective has Israel been in dismantling Iran’s nuclear capabilities?\n\nFirst, the Israeli operation’s objective was not defined as a complete destruction of Iran’s nuclear program. Even before its Friday attack, it was clear that Israel has a relatively limited ability to destroy nuclear capabilities without active participation from the United States. Israel can, however, significantly delay Iran’s nuclear program (by at least a year), mainly by striking facilities—starting with Natanz—assassinating nuclear scientists who represent a key bottleneck in the program, and damaging additional sites. Nevertheless, without striking the enrichment facility at Fordow, which likely would require US participation, Iran’s nuclear program cannot be destroyed, only significantly delayed.As for Iran’s willingness to move forward with its nuclear program, the attack may, paradoxically, encourage Iran to break out toward a nuclear weapon. Nevertheless, making such a decision at this time, especially in view of the intensive Israeli Air Force activity over Iran and Israel’s deep intelligence penetration into Iran’s nuclear program, would be extremely dangerous for Iran and might even motivate Washington to directly join the campaign. Therefore, Iran may prefer to avoid a nuclear breakout—at least at this stage—and instead consider this option in the future.—Raz Zimmt is a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies and the Alliance Center for Iranian Studies at Tel Aviv University. He is also a veteran Iran watcher in the Israeli Defense Forces. Follow him on X: @RZimmt.\n\n### 3. How forcefully has Tehran responded, and what has the impact been?\n\nUltra Orthodox jews look at an impacted site following missile attack from Iran on Israel, in Bnei Brak, Israel June 16, 2025. REUTERS/Miro Maman TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY\n\nI think we are seeing that Iran’s bark is worse than its bite. Israel’s military and intelligence superiority over the Islamic Republic has overwhelmed and severely weakened the regime through decapitations, degradation of its armed forces, and damage to its nuclear program. Iran cannot compete with the surgical and lethal precision with which Israel is mounting its campaign. Israel’s leadership likely factored in the damage to the home front when making the decision to strike Iran so aggressively, and that speaks to the confidence the Israeli defense establishment has in its ability to manage and counter Iranian retaliation. The one area I am most concerned about is the prospect of Tehran activating contingency operations targeting Israeli and Jewish interests abroad via terrorism. Iran may also consider targeting the energy interests of US partners in the Arab world as a means of extracting economic pain for these Israeli attacks. Tehran may likewise turn to cyberattacks against critical infrastructure. But in the end, Iran will face supply constraints, and we’re already seeing missiles being lobbed at Israel in more limited quantities, likely to preserve capacity.—Jason M. Brodsky is the policy director of United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI). His research specialties include Iranian leadership dynamics, Iran’s military and security services, and Iran’s proxy and partner network. He is on X @JasonMBrodsky.\n\n### 4. What are the the environmental and health concerns from attacks on nuclear facilities?\n\nAttacks on nuclear facilities carry the grave threat of significant impacts on health and the environment. In its June 13 statement following Israel’s launch of strikes on Iran, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) [noted] that “at present, the competent Iranian authorities have confirmed that the Natanz enrichment site has been impacted and that there are no elevated radiation levels.” On June 14, the IAEA said there was also no change in offsite radiation at the Esfahan site, where four buildings, including a uranium conversion facility and a fuel plate fabrication plant, had been hit in the attacks from Israel.— [Jennifer T. Gordon] is the director of the Nuclear Energy Policy Initiative and the Daniel B. Poneman chair for nuclear energy policy at the Atlantic Council’s Global Energy Center.\n\n### 5. How has the IAEA responded, and are there restrictions around striking nuclear facilities under international law?\n\nThe IAEA has responded to Israel’s attacks on Iranian nuclear sites by reiterating its stance that “nuclear facilities must never be attacked regardless of the context or circumstances.” The IAEA’s General Conference has published resolutions noting that “any armed attack on and threat against nuclear facilities devoted to peaceful purposes constitutes a violation of the principles of the United Nations Charter, international law and the Statute of the Agency.” Whether Iran’s nuclear facilities were devoted solely to peaceful use is unclear, but regardless, attacks against any type of nuclear facility set a dangerous precedent and make it increasingly difficult to pull back from conflict.—Jennifer T. Gordon\n\n### 6. How aligned, or not, are Washington and Jerusalem?\n\nTrump’s administration and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government are closely aligned on goals, but less aligned on means. They both share the goals of wanting to prevent the Islamic Republic from ever having a nuclear weapon. They share the goal of Hamas being permanently removed from power in Gaza, and for Hezbollah to have far less power in Lebanon than it does now.\n\nOn means, Trump wanted to avoid war—he wants to be a peace-through-strength president, and he has people talking in one ear about supporting Israel and the other about staying clear of Middle East wars. Netanyahu sees a narrow window to eliminate the Iranian nuclear threat and does not believe that the Iranian regime will ever agree to the kind of deal Trump wants. For Netanyahu, war now was the only option. The other important dynamic is that both Trump and Netanyahu believe they have a unique destiny to lead their nations at this hour—but both leaders face a public that is deeply divided about the wisdom of their policy choices. Both are gamblers and will double down when they are convinced they are right. It is inconceivable, therefore, that Trump would ever pressure Netanyahu to end the war short of what it will take to assure Israel’s security. — [Thomas S. Warrick] is a nonresident senior fellow with the Adrienne Arsht National Security Resilience Initiative in the Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security and the Scowcroft Middle East Security Initiative in the Middle East Programs at the Atlantic Council.\n\nRelated reading\n\n#### Why Israel will resist any US-Iran nuclear deal\n\n[MENASource Apr 28, 2025 By Danny Citrinowicz Negotiations between the United States and Iran have displayed a significant divide between Washington and it’s ally Israel.] \n\n[Iran] [Israel] \n\n### 7. Has the conflict tanked the likelihood of achieving a US nuclear deal with Iran?\n\nThe nuclear negotiations between the United States and Iran seemed to have reached an impasse prior to the launch of Israeli strikes, with Washington insisting that Iran must give up enrichment and Tehran, including Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, insisting that Iran would never give this up. The breadth of Israeli military strikes against Iran, spanning key parts of its nuclear infrastructure, senior military officials and nuclear scientists, ballistic missile stockpiles, and more recently energy infrastructure, probably are read in Iran as aimed at regime change, and make it more likely that Tehran will consider a nuclear breakout rather than a compromise in negotiations. That said, Iran may believe it can exploit Trump’s public calls for an end to the fighting and a return to the negotiating table by hinting at concessions that would get the United States to press Israel to stand down, at least temporarily. So a nuclear deal seems remote—but an Iranian negotiating ploy to try to ensure regime survival could be in the cards.— [Alan Pino] is a nonresident senior fellow with the Scowcroft Middle East Security Initiative at the Atlantic Council’s Middle East programs and a former US national intelligence officer for the Near East.\n\nRelated reading\n\n#### Beyond the bomb: Ideology as the engine of Iran’s nuclear doctrine\n\n[MENASource May 6, 2025 By Marjan Keypour Greenblatt The US cannot overlook that Iran’s nuclear program is not simply about deterrence—it is a tool for advancing a revolutionary ideology.] \n\n[Iran] [Middle East] \n\n### 8. Has Washington’s force posture in the Middle East shifted since Friday, and what does this tell us about potential US involvement?\n\nSince Thursday, the Pentagon has approved significant force posture changes for US Central Command (CENTCOM). These changes include a large deployment of KC-135/KC-46 aerial refueling tankers. Depending on the numbers of tankers involved, this could be one of the largest peacetime tanker movements in history. The USS Harry S. Truman carrier strike group’s deployment was extended in the Middle East. Also, the USS Carl Vinson carrier strike group is moving to the CENTCOM region for overlapping carrier presence. European Command has the USS Thomas Hudner (DDG-116) now repositioned in the Eastern Mediterranean to contribute air defense support to Israel.\n\nThese publicly observable movements may not be the only force posture additions in the Middle East. What these changes portend is that the United States is giving itself flexible military options. This means that Washington can contribute to Israel’s operational tempo of attacks through air-to-air refueling. The United States can also increase its ability to respond through any ground-based US Air Force fighters as well as the aircraft from two carrier strike groups. Finally, this means the United States is increasing its defensive presence to contribute to the air defense of Israel.\n\n— [Daniel E. Mouton] is a nonresident senior fellow at the Scowcroft Middle East Security Initiative of the Atlantic Council’s Middle East Programs. He served on the National Security Council from 2021 to 2023 as the director for defense and political-military policy for the Middle East and North Africa.\n\n### 9. What does the response of Iran’s regional proxies tell us?\n\nIran’s regional proxies have been significantly weakened. Hamas has been decimated. Hezbollah has been badly degraded to the point where there have been public reports about its wariness of getting drawn into this conflict between Israel and Iran. Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria is gone. The Houthis retain a capability to strike Israel, but are not a strategic threat. The Iraqi Shiite militias also have resources. But the Islamic Republic’s proxy and partner network is a shell of its former self.—Jason M. Brodsky\n\n### 10. How could this impact Palestinians in Gaza?\n\nThe prevalent fear in Gaza is that an Israel-Iran war will distract from the already significantly dimmed light on the ongoing starvation and slaughter of civilians in the Palestinian enclave. There is also concern that war may lead to even more impunity and an escalation of Israeli bombardment in Gaza. Some people in Gaza that I’ve spoken with are terrified at the level of chaos the Iran strikes could bring—namely, the potential of this conflict spreading further across the region such that it will result in an even more prolonged war inside Gaza. However, some believe, or maybe hope, that this will help at least end this phase of the nightmare, although they don’t really know exactly what an “end” looks like. — [Arwa Damon] is a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Rafik Hariri Center for the Middle East and president and founder of the International Network for Aid, Relief, and Assistance (INARA).Hamas undoubtedly imagines that an Israeli-Iranian war may strategically relieve some of the pressure on the Islamist group in the Gaza Strip, as the Israeli military reallocates intelligence and kinetic strike capabilities to the new theater.\n\nStill, Israel will likely maintain a steady tempo of bombardment and ground operations against suspected Hamas targets in Gaza, as it has since the initiation of hostilities with Tehran. The new war is unlikely to prove beneficial to Hamas in any tactical or geostrategic way. In fact, in the medium term, Hamas’s regional posture will be further degraded by the weakening of its chief backer and supporter in Tehran.\n\nMany Palestinians in Gaza have been subtly or even openly gloating about Iran’s woes, holding Tehran directly responsible for the destruction of their lives through Hamas and the network of anti-Israel terror organizations that served it. Though it may have limited tactical impact in the near term, the weakening or possible collapse of the Iranian regime will be a positive development for the prospects of Gaza’s rejuvenation and regeneration after the war, as well as peace between Palestinians and Israelis. — [Ahmed Fouad Alkhatib] leads Realign For Palestine, an Atlantic Council project that challenges entrenched narratives in the Israel and Palestine discourse.\n\n### 11. Could this war benefit or harm Russia, and how is Moscow navigating both sides?\n\nRussia could potentially benefit from the Israel-Iran conflict, by US attention and support being [redirected] from Ukraine to Israel, and by the rise in oil prices which provide Moscow with greater resources to fund its war against Ukraine. If the Israel-Iran conflict ends quickly, though, these benefits may not last long. The recent [phone call] between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, in which both called for an end to the Israel-Iran conflict, also furthers Putin’s aim of increasing Russian cooperation with Washington despite the war in Ukraine continuing.\n\nBut, as [some Russian commentators have noted,] the Israel-Iran conflict also involves the risk of regime collapse in Iran. Like in Syria, this would mean the downfall of a longstanding government that had cooperated closely with Moscow, and Russia having to compete with others for influence with the new authorities emerging in Iran afterward, whatever they might be. With Russia preoccupied by its war against Ukraine, however, Putin would not be in a strong position to do this.\n\nThus, while the Israel-Iran conflict provides some benefits to Russia, it also poses serious risks for it as well. Putin’s calls to end the Israel-Iran conflict through diplomatic means, then, undoubtedly reflect what he really wants to see happen. Yet even if the conflict does end through (as Putin wants) joint Russian-American mediation efforts, it could result in Iran being more cooperative with the United States than it has been in the past.\n\n— [Mark N. Katz] is a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, and a professor emeritus of government and politics at the George Mason University Schar School of Policy and Government.\n\nRelated reading\n\n#### A Russian-Iranian inaugural gift for Trump\n\n[Inflection Points Today Jan 18, 2025 By Frederick Kempe The new “comprehensive partnership agreement” between Moscow and Tehran is the latest example of greater coordination among the “axis of aggressors.”] \n\n[China] [Conflict] \n\n### 12. Could this war benefit or harm China, and how is Beijing navigating both sides?\n\nChina [condemned] Israel’s attack and has called on both sides to de-escalate. Nevertheless, Beijing almost certainly sees an opportunity to promote itself as a responsible actor, and even a potential mediator, in the crisis. A wider, regional conflict would raise China’s risk-to-benefit calculus as it would threaten its regional economic, namely [energy], interests. As such, China would [welcome] Washington reining in Israel and resuming talks with Iran. China will also be quick to amplify US failings, real or not, if the situation deteriorates as part of its broader campaign to undermine the United States’ global position and influence. — [Gabriel “Gabo” Alvarado] is a former nonresident senior fellow in the Atlantic Council’s Global China Hub. He currently works at Nisos.\n\n### 13. What weapons have Israel and Iran deployed so far?\n\nFrom June 13-16, Israel flew F-35I, F-15I, and F-16 aircraft to conduct hundreds of airstrikes using [GBU-28 bunker busters], [Rampage missiles], and precision munitions against Iranian nuclear facilities, military leadership, and critical infrastructure. Iran retaliated with hundreds of ballistic missiles from its arsenal. Iran‘s attacks include [Fattah hypersonic] missiles, [Khorramshahr ballistic missiles], and other missiles and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to target Israel in “Operation Severe Punishment.”\n\n—Daniel E. Mouton\n\n### 14. What are the nuclear counter-proliferation implications of the conflict?\n\nThe counter-proliferation implications of this conflict are noteworthy. The [IAEA on June 12] [declared Iran non-compliant] with Nuclear Proliferation Treaty (NPT) obligations for the first time in twenty years. Iran responded by announcing a third uranium enrichment site and threatening NPT withdrawal. While Israel may have destroyed Natanz’s above-ground enrichment plant, the crisis runs the risk of paradoxically accelerating proliferation risks. If this conflict does not fully eliminate the current and future threat of Iranian proliferation, Iran’s irreversible knowledge of the enrichment cycle means that it can simply rebuild and do so with a greater desire to succeed next time.—Daniel E. Mouton\n\n### 15. What Iranian oil and gas facilities has Israel targeted, and does this have an impact on the wider fallout?\n\nIsrael appears to have successfully hit two natural gas processing facilities in Phase Fourteen of the South Pars gas field, forcing Iran to suspend operations there. Iran’s natural gas production is consumed domestically due to significant sanctions on exporting natural gas. Israeli strikes also hit a major fuel depot and an oil refinery near Tehran. These are significant hits because Iran’s energy situation was already precarious, with parts of the country experiencing planned blackouts due to electricity shortages. Without consistent access to fuel, Iranians living in Tehran cannot evacuate. If Israel takes out additional domestic energy sites around Iran, the potential for the country to simply fall apart is very high. Without fuel, food cannot be transported to cities. Without electricity and running water, illness will proliferate and people will die.\n\n## SIGN UP FOR THIS WEEK IN THE MIDEAST NEWSLETTER\n\nAt the same time, Israel has not gone after oil production facilities or Kharg Island, where 90 percent of Iran’s crude oil and condensate exports are loaded onto tankers. This leaves Iran’s role in the global oil market relatively unchanged, keeping China satisfied and oil prices under control. If Israel does attack Iran’s oil production or export sites, the entire paradigm will change. As senior official Javad Larijani [recently said], if Iran’s oil facilities are severely damaged, Tehran won’t let any country in the region use its own oil.\n\n— [Ellen R. Wald] is a nonresident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council Global Energy Center and the president of Transversal Consulting.\n\n### 16. What is the Strait of Hormuz, and why does it matter if Tehran closes it?\n\nMost oil market watchers think this conflict is a direct threat to the Strait of Hormuz, a very narrow waterway that leads out of the Persian Gulf. Oil tankers loading oil from Iraq, Kuwait, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, parts of the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, and Iran must pass through this chokepoint to exit the Gulf. Approximately 20 percent of the world’s seaborne crude oil exports travel through the Strait of Hormuz. It is very narrow, rocky, and only deep enough for oil tankers to navigate in certain places. The current traffic patterns for the Strait have ships traveling through Iranian waters to enter and exit the Gulf.\n\nIran may be able to block ships using ships and missiles launched from the shore, though this would only be temporary as the traffic pattern can be rerouted around Iranian waters. It would take some time, and there would be a period of dislocation during which oil prices would spike, but it could be done. However, Iran will only directly threaten the security of ships in the Persian Gulf if it has nothing to lose. Since Iran continues to export oil and condensate, and needs to continue to do so to fund its operations, it is extremely unlikely that it will take action to hamper or halt any ship traffic into or out of the Persian Gulf.—Ellen R. Wald\n\n### 17. What dynamics is the Iranian regime grappling with domestically, and how will this impact the conflict?\n\nAt this stage, the Iranian regime appears to be maintaining its unity, resolve, and stability, and is closing ranks in the face of an external threat. The anger of the Iranian public, whose hostility toward the regime is well known, has grown due to the authorities’ failure to provide security and protect their people. Nevertheless, it seems that at this moment, the public’s attitude is influenced largely by images of civilians injured and damage to residential neighborhoods in Tehran from Israeli Air Force attacks. This could contribute (at least for now) to a strengthening of national solidarity and a rally-around-the-flag effect. Nevertheless, the continued Israeli military efforts may, over time, weaken the regime’s security, intelligence, and governmental structures, as well as its ability to deal with internal challenges, which could, in the future, pave the way for undermining its stability.—Raz Zimmt\n\n### 18. How is the Iranian public responding?\n\nWith the caveat that my sources are limited, I’m seeing a range of responses from the Iranian people. Regime supporters, who are now a small minority, are predictably outraged at Israel and support the Islamic Republic’s retaliatory strikes. Most Iranians at this point oppose their regime, and there’s little love lost for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) leaders whom Israel killed. However, many Iranians are expressing sorrow for the innocent civilians killed in the Israeli strikes, particularly those who died when Israel struck residential apartment buildings in Tehran. For Iranians who lived through the Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988), the strikes have also stirred up traumatic memories of bombs raining down on Tehran during that war.\n\nA woman carries her child following the Israeli strikes on Iran, in Tehran, Iran, June 15, 2025. Amir Kholousi/WANA (West Asia News Agency) via REUTERS ATTENTION EDITORS – THIS PICTURE WAS PROVIDED BY A THIRD PARTY TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY\n\nIt’s important to note that a lot of Iranians, including those who oppose their government, have complicated feelings about the country’s nuclear program. Many feel that Iran has a right like any other country to have a nuclear program for energy purposes. Yet the idea of developing a nuclear weapon is controversial, with many opposing nuclear weapons for a variety of reasons. The Iranian people also overwhelmingly do not want war. The majority at this point want to see the end of the Islamic Republic and its replacement with a democratic system grounded in human rights and peace.\n\nMostly, I’ve seen the Iranian people express a lot of anger at their own government for the current situation. They’ve pointed out how there was no warning from the government, no air raid sirens or any other alert, before the Israeli strikes hit. Instead, the strikes hit residential buildings in the early hours of the morning as the people inside slept, oblivious to the danger headed toward them. The public is angry, but not surprised, that the Islamic Republic did not protect its own people. They’ve suffered a lot already, and they are fearful, worried, and angry that many more innocent Iranians are likely to suffer in the conflict to come, especially if things escalate into all-out war.\n\n—Kelly J. Shannon is a historian and visiting scholar at the Institute for Middle East Studies at George Washington University. She is also a member of the Atlantic Council’s Iran Strategy Project Working Group.\n\n### 19. How is the Israeli public responding?\n\nMost of the Israeli public supports the government’s action and sees the launch of strikes as necessary considering the claims that Iran is dangerously close to a nuclear bomb. Meanwhile the public is giving credit to the government in the campaign, despite the severe casualties on the Israeli home front.—Danny Citrinowicz\n\n### 20. Where do we go from here?\n\nIsrael’s broad-based assault on Iran’s nuclear and governmental infrastructure and Tehran’s massive missile barrages against Israeli civilians have raised the stakes sky-high for both countries, making it hard to engineer a cease-fire. Israeli officials continue to say that they have many more targets to strike, as they broaden their campaign beyond nuclear installations, top military officials, ballistic missile launch pads, and stockpiles to Iran’s energy infrastructure and government buildings in Tehran. When asked by an interviewer if Israel is seeking regime change in Iran, [Netanyahu said] that regime change could be the result of Israel’s actions because “the Iran regime is very weak.” Israel, at a minimum, wants to do enough damage to Iran’s nuclear program that Tehran cannot reconstitute it for the foreseeable future or race to get a nuclear weapon.Iranian leaders seem to calculate they must continue to show they can inflict punishment on Israel or risk further losing credibility in the eyes of Iranians and perhaps face significant unrest from their population, many of whom have turned against the ruling clerics. Trump may be the wild card here depending on whether he wants to let the two sides [“fight it out,”] or if he decides to press Israel to wind down its attacks and Iran to return to nuclear negotiations. Given that a nuclear deal in which Iran gives up enrichment is unlikely, even if a temporary halt to the fighting is achieved, Israel will keep Iran in its crosshairs and conflict between the two countries will dominate Trump’s Middle East agenda for the forseeable future.—Alan Pino\n\n#### Further reading\n\nSat, Jun 14, 2025\n\n#### Israel’s Iran strike provides a historic chance for Middle East realignment\n\nInflection Points By [Frederick Kempe] \n\nHistory will remember this moment less for the Israeli strikes themselves and more for what follows.\n\n[Iran] [Israel] \n\nThu, Jun 12, 2025\n\n#### Experts react: Israel just attacked Iran’s military and nuclear sites.

Gen. Aziz Nasirzadeh, who claimed that Iran’s defense industry has not only rebounded but expanded. \"Iran’s defense production has improved both in quantity and quality compared to before the 12-day Israeli-imposed war in June,\" Nasirzadeh said Monday, insisting that new missiles are rolling off production lines faster than ever.\n\n[IRAN PRESIDENT ACCUSES US OF 'GRAVE BETRAYAL' WITH NUCLEAR STRIKES IN UNGA SPEECH] \n\nMissiles launched from Iran towards Israel are seen from Tubas in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, June 14, 2025.

The United States joined the operation days later with a series of precision strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities.\n\nBehnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Fox News Digital that Iran’s renewed emphasis on missile production is no surprise given what it learned during the June conflict.\n\n\"There’s no doubt that after the 12-Day War, Tehran understands the missiles constitute the long pole in its ability to deter and punish attacks,\" Taleblu said. \"Expect Tehran to therefore concentrate on building back better when it comes to its missile program, which pre-war was already the largest in the region.\"\n\nHe warned that Iran’s accelerating focus on missile development could be the spark for the next regional conflict. \"It’s for this reason that the next likely conflict between Israel and Iran may well be brought about by missile concerns, not nuclear,\" Taleblu said.\n\n[TRUMP'S IRAN GAMBLE PAYS OFF AS WWIII DOOMSAYERS NOW PRAISE ISRAEL-HAMAS CEASEFIRE] \n\nFirefighters and rescue personnel work at an impact site following a missile attack from Iran on Israel, at Haifa, Israel, June 15, 2025.

Gen. (res.) Yossi Kuperwasser, head of the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security, said Tehran’s post-war threats reflect both internal pressure and an effort to regain leverage.\n\nAfter the U.S. bombed Iran’s nuclear sites, Tehran said talks on a renewed nuclear deal were off.

(Fox News)\n\nKuperwasser said Iran’s hardliners are using missile rhetoric to test international resolve. \"They are attempting to pressure the international community to ease sanctions and diplomatic isolation by issuing threats of escalation,\" he said. \"To make these threats credible, and drawing lessons from the war in June, they are working intensively to replenish their arsenal of long-range missiles.\"\n\nKuperwasser warned that while [Iran’s nuclear ambitions] remain, its focus on missile production shows the regime’s priority is deterrence. \"Their threats should not be dismissed,\" he said. \"They must be taken seriously.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Tehran has already tested several satellite launch vehicles that use the same multi-stage propulsion and guidance systems needed for an intercontinental ballistic missile. Washington has repeatedly accused Iran of using its civilian space program as cover for developing technologies that could deliver nuclear payloads at intercontinental range.\n\n[CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP] \n\nIsraeli defense officials, in turn, have been racing to expand production of interceptors across the country’s multi-layered air-defense network. The Iron Dome, David’s Sling and Arrow systems were all pushed to their limits during the 12-Day War, when Iran launched hundreds of ballistic and cruise missiles toward Israeli cities and military installations.\n\nPart of the Israeli response goes beyond replenishing interceptors. The country is now fielding one of the world’s first operational high-power laser air-defense systems. The [Iron Beam system] has completed acceptance testing and is being delivered to the Israel air force for operational deployment, Fox News Digital reported last month. The system is designed to intercept rockets, mortars, drones and other aerial threats \"at a fraction of the cost of conventional interceptors.\"\n\nFor Israel and the U.S., Iran’s latest boasts serve as a warning that the 12-Day War may not have settled much at all: both militaries are now racing to prepare for what they see as the next test of regional defenses, one measured in missile ranges and response times.\n\nPrint Close\n\n[URL] \n\nhttps://www.foxnews.com/politics/iran-claims-missile-power-now-far-surpasses-pre-war-levels-after-israeli-bombardment\n\n- [Weather] \n- [Sports] \n- [World] \n- [Lifestyle] \n- [Travel] \n- [Health] \n- [Science] \n- [Tech] \n- [Entertainment] \n- [Opinion] \n- [U.S.] \n- [Politics] \n- [Video] \n- [Home] \n\n- [Terms] \n- [Privacy] \n\nThis material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. © FOX News Network, LLC.

He called the estimate “at best a back-of-the-envelope calculation.”\nAccording to the IDF, Iran used 120 MRBMs in its April 13 attack last year on Israel, another 200 on October 1, and a total of 380 in the past five days. This tally would deplete its overall known arsenal by a total of 700. But whether it leaves Tehran with an existential crisis over its missile deterrence depends on both the size of its initial stockpile, and what damage Israel has done to Iran’s military infrastructure, since it began striking across the country on Friday.\nBen Taleblu suggested this might leave Iran with 1,300 MRBMs. Other estimates were more pessimistic. Dr. Eyal Pinko, a retired Israeli naval intelligence officer, now a senior research fellow at the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies, said: “Taking into consideration that they fired around 400 to 500 in the last four days and Israel destroyed some of the arsenal of what they had, I believe they have now 800 to 700.”\n![A motorcyclist observes an Iranian Sejjil solid-fueled medium-range ballistic missile on display at a square in southern Tehran during a military exhibition, September 26, 2023.] \nA motorcyclist observes an Iranian Sejjil solid-fueled medium-range ballistic missile on display at a square in southern Tehran during a military exhibition, September 26, 2023.\nMorteza Nikoubazl/NurPhoto/Getty Images/File\nThe few glimpses of the damage done to Iran’s air defenses and missile production from Israeli strikes on October 26 have revealed a significant toll. Admiral Tony Radakin, the UK’s Chief of the Defence Staff, said in a December speech that 100 Israeli aircraft had fired as many missiles from as many miles away and “took down nearly the entirety of Iran’s air defense system. It has destroyed Iran’s ability to produce ballistic missiles for a year.”\nBut recently Israel has amplified the threat that Iran’s[missile production] poses. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Friday, as Israel launched its air campaign, that Iran had sped up its manufacture of ballistic missiles to 300 a month, which could leave them with 20,000 in six years. He did not provide evidence for the claim.\nPinko said the 2024 strikes had “destroyed the main facilities for manufacturing ballistic missiles motors” in Iran, creating severe limitations to the country’s supply chain. Still, he notes that potential assistance from China in the coming months could boost production again.\nIran would not want its arsenal of MRBMs to sink “below four digits,” said Ben Taleblu.\n“For the Islamic Republic, quantity has a quality of its own,” he said, adding that Iran excels “in crisis management but is actually a poor conventional warfighter. And having to expend these ballistic missiles during a time of war, rather than a time of crisis precisely puts it in this bind.”\nAd Feedback\nAd Feedback\nAd Feedback\nAd Feedback\nAd Feedback"

              "reasoning": "Okay, so I need to analyze these five disciplines' summaries about Iran and identify convergent, contradictory, and emergent points. Let's start by reading through each discipline's summary carefully.\n\nLooking at the convergent concepts first. I notice that several disciplines mention \"regime change\" as a concept. Discipline 0 (Left) talks about domestic repression narratives being used to legitimize foreign intervention, which might connect to regime change. Discipline 1 (Center-Left) explicitly mentions regime change rhetoric and skepticism towards military solutions. Discipline 3 (Ctr-Right) discusses the regime's legitimacy crisis and Trump considering military strikes. So \"regime change\" is present in 1, 3, maybe 0? Wait, Discipline 0's claim is about supporting anti-regime protests while endorsing foreign interventions. So regime change is a common theme here. That could be a convergent concept across 0,1,3.\n\nAnother convergent idea is the role of military actions and their consequences. Discipline 0 critiques military-industrial complex and imperialism, Discipline 1 mentions preemptive strikes and humanitarian crises, Discipline 2 talks about US-Israel military operations, Discipline 3 has maximum pressure and military strikes, and Discipline 4 emphasizes maximalist military responses. So military action is a common thread, but specifically looking at which disciplines explicitly overlap. The concept of military strikes leading to civilian casualties or destabilization might converge in 1,2,3. For example, Discipline 1 and 3 both discuss strikes and their consequences on regime stability. So maybe \"Military Strikes and Civilian Impact\" converges across 1,2,3.\n\nEconomic factors are another convergent point. Discipline 0 mentions social cohesion possibly related to economic issues, Discipline 3 discusses economic collapse and currency issues, and Discipline 4's context might relate to economic strain from military actions. But looking at the terms, Discipline 3 mentions currency collapse and economic mismanagement, while Center-Left (1) talks about humanitarian crisis which could be tied to economic factors. So \"Economic Collapse and Regime Priorities\" could converge between 3 and 1, but maybe others. Wait, looking deeper, Discipline 3's claims say the regime prioritizes proxies over economy, and Discipline 2's summaries don't focus much on economy. But maybe Discipline 0's analysis of contradictions between supporting protests and foreign intervention relates to economic factors. Perhaps \"Economic Collapse & Regime Priorities\" is convergent across 0,1,3.\n\nNow looking at contradictory elements. For instance, Discipline 0 (Left) critiques imperialism and military interventions, while Discipline 2 (Center) sees Iran as a security concern needing military action. That's a direct tension between military approach vs. anti-interventionist stance. So that's a contradiction between 0 and 2.\n\nAnother contradiction could be between Discipline 4 (Right) advocating for maximalist military responses and Discipline 1 (Center-Left) being skeptical of military solutions. So Right vs Center-Left. But the user might want specific pairs. Maybe another contradiction is between Discipline 3 (Ctr-Right) viewing the regime as weakened and needing containment, while Discipline 0 argues that foreign intervention contradicts anti-war principles. So how the regime's vulnerability is approached: containment vs. non-intervention.\n\nFor emergent insights, after integrating all disciplines, maybe there's a synthesis that economic collapse and military pressure create cyclical crises without clear resolution. Or that despite different approaches, all disciplines acknowledge the regime's resilience due to dispersed power structures. Looking at the summaries, multiple mention the regime's resilience despite economic issues. For example, Discipline 4 talks about Iran's military resurgence, Discipline 3 notes the regime's prioritization of proxies over economy, and the Eurasia Strategy Insights source in the provided data mentions the regime's resilience despite economic strain. So an emergent insight could be that the regime's endurance is due to power dispersal among elites and security networks, which isn't captured by any single discipline but becomes clear when combining them.\n\nAnother emergent insight might be that external military actions, regardless of intent, inadvertently strengthen the regime's narrative of defiance against foreign threats, thereby consolidating domestic control. This is seen in how different disciplines discuss the effects of strikes: Left critiques intervention, Right advocates it, but together, the effect on regime stability might be paradoxical.\n\nPutting this all together, making sure each entry in convergent has at least two disciplines, contradictions involve genuine opposing views, and emergent insights are new realizations from combining disciplines.\n",

The state responded with overwhelming brutal force, killing at least 6,506 protesters, [according] to the Human Rights Activists News Agency, and imposing a near-total internet shutdown that lasted for weeks.\n\nSupreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei himself [framed] the unrest in existential terms. He described the protests as “akin to a coup,” declaring that “the coup was suppressed.” Such language was revealing not only of the government’s heavily securitized mindset, but of the competition within the state itself.\n\nUnderstanding these internal dynamics is essential to grasping the current moment, the delicate balancing act facing Iran’s multilayered security and political institutions, and Khamenei as they seek to consolidate authority while navigating mounting internal and external pressure.\n\nThe protests did not emerge spontaneously. Iran has been mired in deepening economic distress for years. Since the imposition of sweeping “maximum pressure” U.S. sanctions in 2018, millions have [fallen] from the middle class into poverty. Inflation has hollowed out wages, the currency has sharply and precipitously declined, and economic insecurity has become a defining feature of daily life. At the same time, broad swaths of Iranian society have grown ever more disillusioned with clerical rule and the political stagnation it represents.\n\nBut the protests’ origins in Alaeddin and Charsou malls, major hubs for mobile phone and electronics trade, may not have been coincidental. Alaeddin in particular has long been linked to a businessman [believed] to have ties to conservative power centers. In Iran’s deeply distorted and sanctions-ridden economy, such commercial nodes are not merely marketplaces. They sit at the intersection of politics, currency allocation, and informal trade networks. Years of sanctions have pushed much of Iran’s economy into gray- and black-market channels, empowering intermediaries who facilitate covert oil sales, currency transfers, and import arrangements.\n\nThe system of multiple exchange rates amplified these distortions. For years, a “preferential” rate of 285,000 rials to the dollar was [granted] to select importers and producers, while the free market rate had surged to roughly 1.4 million rials by late December. The enormous gap created vast arbitrage opportunities and fostered entrenched rent-seeking networks. It also fueled intense, largely behind-the-scenes infighting among rival elites competing over access to scarce hard currency and control over economic policy.\n\nIt was into this fragile and corruption-prone system that President Masoud Pezeshkian moved in November, [attempting] to narrow distortions and move toward exchange rate unification. The reforms aimed to curb arbitrage and reduce the influence of rent networks tied to the old preferential regime. But as importers were pushed into the thinner free currency market, demand for dollars [surged] and the rial slid further, deepening public anxiety and economic strain.\n\nAt the same time, [reports] emerged that billions in oil revenues held abroad by intermediaries, often referred to as “trustees,” had not been repatriated on schedule. Whether due to foreign pressure, mismanagement, or deliberate delay, the withholding of hard currency further constricted supply in an already fragile market. Some Iranian [analysts] saw this not merely as economic dysfunction, but as part of a broader U.S. or Israeli covert action against Iran and a coordinated effort to destabilize the government at a sensitive postwar moment following the June war with Israel.\n\nYet reducing these developments to external sabotage alone misses arguably the most consequential layer. In Iran, external pressure and internal rivalry are deeply intertwined. Competing elite factions routinely use moments of crisis to weaken rivals, advance preferred policies, and reshape the balance of power inside the system. The battle over exchange rate unification, the backlash from entrenched rent networks, the initial bazaar unrest, and the harsh repression that followed all unfolded within this ongoing struggle.\n\nWhat has emerged from it remains uncertain. Figures such as Ali Larijani, a pragmatic conservative and current secretary of the Supreme National Security Council; Hassan Khomeini, a grandson of the Islamic Republic’s founder whose [high visibility] in recent weeks has fueled speculation that he is on a shortlist to succeed Khamenei; and Ali Shamkhani, who survived an Israeli assassination attempt last summer and was recently [appointed] head of Iran’s new Defense Council, appear relatively strengthened. Even former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has alongside Khomeini.\n\nWhile the most consequential shifts may be unfolding behind closed doors, one development is unmistakable: In the aftermath of historic protests, Iran has launched its largest [purge] of reformists since 2009, arresting prominent former officials and senior leaders of the Reform Front, many of whom were instrumental in Pezeshkian’s election. Those [detained] include Azar Mansouri, the Reform Front’s secretary-general; Ebrahim Asgharzadeh, head of its political committee; Javad Imam, its spokesperson; and Ali Shakouri-Rad, the former lawmaker whose recent remarks questioning the official narrative of the protests drew hard-line fury.\n\nThis was not a marginal faction. The Reform Front had sharply condemned the mass killings of January, calling for an independent fact-finding committee to investigate what it described as an unprecedented tragedy. It [proposed] forming a “National Assembly” to help steer the country out of crisis. After the June war with Israel, it had even [endorsed] negotiations over uranium enrichment, long treated as a political red line. In short, it was attempting to reopen space for managed structural reform at a moment of acute danger.\n\nBefore their arrest, several of the movement’s leading figures were [reportedly] working to build a broader civic platform that would extend beyond the traditional reformist-conservative divide. At a moment of deep instability, such an initiative was likely seen by authorities as the embryo of an organized internal alternative. The arrests reflect a different strategic choice: to tighten the circle of insiders and block any convergence between structural reformists still inside the system and more openly oppositional former officials such as Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mostafa Tajzadeh, now under house arrest and in prison, respectively. With questions on Khamenei’s looming succession and nuclear talks restarting under the shadow of war, the Iranian leadership appears intent on preemptively neutralizing internal challengers before they can coalesce into something more consequential.\n\nIn any case, the sweep marks the culmination of the reformist movement’s long decline. From the optimism of the “Second of Khordad” movement after Mohammad Khatami’s 1997 election as president, reformists were steadily weakened in the ensuing years through press closures, mass disqualifications in elections, and systematic repression, with the crushed Green Movement of 2009 as the decisive rupture. What had remained to today was a diminished camp divided between technocrats seeking limited openings and structural reformists who advocated pressure from below and bargaining at the top. It is the latter who now seem to be pushed out of the system altogether.\n\nIn the audio that preceded his arrest, Shakouri-Rad [warned] that the disappearance of a credible political center would itself deepen the crisis. The middle ground, he argued, is a form of social capital that helps defuse unrest. Instead, he said, Iran is witnessing dangerous polarization. “We no longer have a middle force that can resolve crises,” he cautioned, describing a society in which protesters and security forces increasingly view one another as enemies rather than fellow citizens.\n\nHe also suggested that rising monarchist slogans reflect not ideological devotion but political abandonment. Many have turned to figures like Reza Pahlavi, he argued, because reformist and peaceful paths for change have been systematically closed. By sidelining reformists, the state may be eliminating not just rivals, but the last institutional buffer between itself and a deeply frustrated public.\n\n- Middle East and North Africa\n- Iran\n\nSina Toossi is a senior nonresident fellow at the Center for International Policy.

Since 2017, large-scale demonstrations have swept across Iran on four occasions, with masses of citizens from diverse regions and backgrounds taking to the streets to express frustration with the ruling establishment. They have been motivated by a litany of grievances but invariably call for major political change or outright revolution. In that context, the protests that have dominated recent headlines should be seen as more than social unrest in response to the failing Iranian economy. Rather, they reflect how large segments of the Iranian population can no longer tolerate a brutal regime that mismanages state resources, imposes its rigid ideology on the people, and instigates conflict with its neighbors.\n\nThe protest activity suggests that Iran has entered a proto-revolutionary period, in fact. The regime faced large-scale civil upheaval and calls for its overthrow in the Dey protests in 2017-18, the Bloody Aban protests in 2019, the Woman, Life, Freedom protests in 2022-23, and the most recent wave that began in December 2025 and has stretched into 2026. Protest turnout appears to be growing in size and violence with each wave of demonstrations. Iranian authorities have responded to the protests with contempt and treated them more like a military issue than a social one, framing the aggrieved citizens as enemies of the state. Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, among other senior officials, have portrayed protesters as foreign agents and terrorists rather than his constituency. Though it is unclear whether the protests will topple the regime any time soon, the widespread public anger toward the regime is evident and seems to be growing.\n\nThe public discontent with the regime will continue to manifest and intensify because Iranian authorities will not solve the underlying issues. They would need to fundamentally restructure their political economy to create serious relief for everyday Iranians. That would involve reducing the control that the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) and other state-affiliated monopolies have over the economy. The regime would need to address the parastatal entities that propagate corruption and nepotism. The regime would need to strike deals with the United States, accepting limits on its nuclear program and possibly missile development in exchange for sanctions relief. The regime would also need to ease its aggressive enforcement of behavioral standards, such as the mandatory hijab law, which was one of the key drivers of the Woman, Life, Freedom protests. But Supreme Leader Khamenei and his inner circle have refused to make such concessions at every turn and instead reiterated their uncompromising position vis-a-vis the protests.\n\nRather than reforms, Khamenei and his minions have tried to resolve the popular discontent with more ideology and repression. Khamenei has overseen a propaganda and indoctrination campaign since 2019 to “re-ideologize” the Iranian people, working on the theory that renewing their commitment to the regime’s revolutionary principles would lead them to accept sub-standard governance.[1] Khamenei argues that the United States is waging an economic and psychological war against Iran and is therefore responsible for the poor domestic conditions. He argues that the population must rally behind the regime to prevail against this US aggression. When propaganda is insufficient to keep people off the streets, Khamenei has deployed militarized security units to use extreme violence against protesters.[2] Current estimates indicate that Iranian security forces have killed thousands—possibly over 30,000—in the most recent protest wave, marking an unprecedentedly violent crackdown on citizens demanding a more responsible government.[3] This regime approach—combining ideologization with repression—has failed to quell social unrest permanently, however, as large-scale protests have continued to manifest every few years and will very likely reappear in the future. The tone-deaf messaging and violent repression from Iranian authorities only reinforces further to disillusioned Iranians that the regime in its current form has no serious solutions.\n\nMounting public pressure and protest activity will eventually force the regime to change in some way—though not necessarily for the better. The regime could intensify its repression even further, devolving into a North Korea-like police and surveillance state, and oppress its people so aggressively that they can no longer challenge the ruling establishment. The regime could alternatively moderate its behavior and pursue major economic and social reforms that address citizens’ complaints. Even then, Tehran might pursue a foreign policy contrary to US interests, such as continuing to collaborate with China and Russia to undermine US global influence. The regime could also collapse or fragment, plunging the country into instability. These are only some of the possible trajectories before Iran. Major change of some sort will come, whether it follows 86-year-old Khamenei’s death, a popular uprising, or something else entirely. Although a free and democratic Iran is ideal, the United States must brace for all possible scenarios.\n\nEndnotes\n\n[1] https://www.hudson.org/politics-government/political-transition-post-raisi-and-iran[2] https://www.aei.org/research-products/report/whatever-it-takes-to-end-it-irans-shift-toward-more-oppressive-governance[3] https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2026/jan/27/iran-protests-death-toll-disappeared-bodies-mass-burials-30000-dead\n\n[Previous] \n\n[Next] \n\nRelated\n\n## Research\n\nUpdate\n\nFeb 27, 2026\n\nMiddle East\n\nIran & ProxiesIraqSyria\n\n### Iran Update, February 27, 2026\n\n[READ MORE] \n\nUpdate\n\nFeb 26, 2026\n\nMiddle East\n\nIran & ProxiesIraqSyria\n\n### Iran Update, February 26, 2026\n\n[READ MORE] \n\nUpdate\n\nFeb 25, 2026\n\nMiddle East\n\nIran & ProxiesIraqSyria\n\n### Iran Update, February 25, 2026\n\n[READ MORE] \n\nUpdate\n\nFeb 24, 2026\n\nMiddle East\n\nIran & ProxiesIraqSyria\n\n### Iran Update, February 24, 2026\n\n[READ MORE]"

The crackdown will therefore fail to address the underlying causes of the protests and could create more grievances that drive future protests. The Iranian regime’s ongoing securitization measures, which include a costly and prolonged internet shutdown, are accelerating Iran’s economic collapse. The country’s economic collapse was the initial trigger for these demonstrations in late December 2025.[1] The crackdown’s economic consequences have struck individual Iranians and businesses alike. The Iranian rial again fell to an all-time low on January 27 (see graphic below), and the price of basic goods has increased 60 percent since mid-December.[2] The internet shutdown costs the regime about $37 million USD daily.[3] Iranian online businesses, which are a major part of Iran’s digital economy and generate $1 billion USD annually, have incurred at least $2 million USD in losses daily during the shutdown.[4] The shutdown has lasted 20 days and is the third-longest internet shutdown globally in history, according to regional media.[5] The regime has made only isolated efforts to compensate businesses, such as by announcing an eight-stage compensation plan for online businesses on January 27.[6] It is unclear how the government intends to pay for this or future compensation packages, given that the regime is already struggling to generate government revenue. The regime’s challenges in generating revenue have also contributed to protester grievances because the challenges have forced the regime to raise taxes.[7] The regime’s response prioritizes securitization over addressing root economic causes, which makes future protests more likely.[8]\n\nThe regime’s decision to persist with its crackdown indicates that the regime continues to fear protests and understands that protests only temporarily stopped due to the widespread securitization and fear caused by the regime’s extreme violence.[9] The violent crackdown may slow or stop protests temporarily, but it will not stop protests from occurring again in the future. This violence will temporarily deter people from protesting, but anger and frustration with the regime remain. Anecdotal reports from protester funerals and other commemorations in recent weeks indicate that Iranians continue to detest the regime and could protest if security pressure were lifted.[10] The regime has killed thousands of protesters, and security forces have arrested 41,880 people—more than double the number arrested in the 2022 Mahsa Amini protests.[11] Iranian judiciary officials have meanwhile threatened to show “no leniency” towards the arrested protesters.[12] The internet shutdown demonstrates that the regime recognizes the fundamental reality that the unrest remains an existential threat due to the widespread nature of frustration at the economic situation and anger at the extreme violence the regime employed.[13]\n\nThe internet shutdown is also liable to contribute to political grievances. The long-lasting internet shutdown has stripped the Iranian people of long-running modern conveniences that they have become accustomed to, including access to an internet-based economy and the ability to communicate relatively easily. The continued imposition of the shutdown will likely continue to aggravate the Iranian people and can create the conditions that can lead to further uprisings. Many Egyptians during the 2011 Tahrir Square protests—according to one study, as many as 27.5% of protesters—only became active protesters after the internet shutdown, for example.[14]\n\nPro-government Syrian media reported that the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and Syrian government reached a new “understanding” on January 27 to deploy Ministry of Interior (MoI) forces to Hasakah Province, which would be a tangible step towards the civil integration of the province into the Syrian state. Syrian President Ahmed al Shara met with SDF Commander Mazloum Abdi and Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria official Ilham Ahmed in Damascus on December 17, reportedly along with US and French mediators.[15] Unspecified sources told a Turkey-based, pro-government Syrian media outlet that Shara and Abdi agreed to a ceasefire on all fronts and to the deployment of MoI forces to Hasakah City, Qamishli, and other unspecified areas.[16] A January 20 agreement between Shara and Abdi had banned government forces from entering Hasakah City, Qamishli, and Kurdish-majority towns and villages.[17] The sources said that the agreement will be announced and implemented within the next few days.[18] Neither the Syrian government nor the SDF has officially acknowledged the ”understanding” as described by the aforementioned Syrian outlet’s sources, but the outlet has access to and consistently cites Syrian government officials and those with knowledge of the negotiations with the SDF. Shara spoke with US President Donald Trump after he met with Abdi on January 27.[19] Trump told reporters after his call with Shara that he is ”very happy about” the situation in Syria and that it is”working out very well.”[20] An anti-SDF, Deir ez Zor-based source alleged on January 27 that SDF-affiliated internal security forces asked fighters for initial registration information for those who seek to work under the Syrian state‘s Interior Ministry.[21]\n\nThe deployment of MoI forces, which is a gendarmerie that has already deployed to secure most of government-controlled northeastern Syria, would represent a significant step towards the civil integration of the area into the state that the SDF has largely refused to indulge thus far.[22] Shara initially gave Abdi four days (later extended by an additional 15 days) to consult with SDF leaders and secure their agreement to Shara’s terms for the integration of the SDF and present a practical plan for the integration of the remaining SDF-held territory into the Syrian state.[23] SDF fighters will reportedly remain deployed to their current positions as part of the new ”understanding,” which suggests that Shara and Abdi have not yet agreed upon a clear mechanism to integrate SDF fighters into state security services.[24] Some hardline elements within the SDF’s leadership may pressure Abdi to reject Shara’s terms for the SDF’s integration, given how Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK)-aligned leaders have subverted and delayed previous rounds of negotiations.[25]\n\nOther non-SDF Kurdish political factions are pressuring Abdi to disregard the People’s Protection Units (YPG) and its political wing, the Democratic Union Party (PYD). Syrian media reported that the Kurdish National Council (KNC), a coalition of Syrian Kurdish political parties that does not include the PYD, urged Abdi to avoid any future “catastrophic” military conflicts with the Syrian government and prioritize negotiations and dialogue during a meeting in Hasakah on January 25.[26] The KNC reportedly holds the SDF and PYD ”responsible” for the conflict in the northeast, according to unspecified sources.[27] The PYD is the KNC’s political rival. The KNC’s request that Abdi disregard pressure from the PYD, and therefore the YPG, to reject Shara’s agreements is notable given that the KNC unified with the PYD and other Kurdish political parties in April 2025 to call for a unified entity that would administer all Kurdish-majority regions in northeastern Syria.[28] The KNC has historically aligned itself with the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and its president, Masoud Barzani.[29] Barzani has emerged as a key interlocutor between Shara and Abdi, who has largely urged restraint and dialogue from both sides.[30]\n\nCTP-ISW continues to assess that the SDF’s leadership may fracture over a decision to agree to Shara’s terms for the SDF to integrate into the Syrian state, which would risk instigating serious conflict between government forces and Kurdish fighters. Abdi and Shara may come to an agreement that ends the immediate fighting in northeastern Syria and creates a plan to integrate SDF fighters into state security services, but CTP-ISW is considering that hardliners within the SDF may contribute to future instability within Syria in the following two ways:\n\n1. A second scenario would entail the formation of a widespread Kurdish insurgency that is not restricted to hardline YPG fighters and includes many nominally unaffiliated Kurds in northeastern Syria. YPG fighters would still form the core of the insurgency’s leadership in this scenario. The Syrian government is currently deliberately undermining the SDF and YPG by introducing limited Kurdish rights and conducting outreach to Kurdish notables, which is likely designed to politically subvert the SDF and YPG to prevent future military resistance. Shara has used similar strategies of political subversion to prevent possible adversaries from resisting him militarily (described below).[33]\n2. One scenario would involve an insurgency by hardline YPG elements who decide to resume attacks or launch an insurgency against the Syrian government, even if Abdi and other more moderate SDF leaders formally accept Shara’s terms. A senior PKK leader recently called on Kurdish fighters to ”do whatever is necessary” to respond to the war that the Syrian government has launched to remove the “will and status” of the Kurdish people.[31] A suicide attack targeting Syrian government forces that the SDF recently claimed on January 26 indicates that hardline, ideological fighters remain present along frontlines.[32] These fighters are unlikely to accept their own integration into the Syrian state.This insurgency would likely be slightly more violent and a greater threat to the government than the pro-Assad insurgency that the Syrian government has faced in western Syria since the fall of the Assad regime. Pro-Assad insurgents have formed small groups and intermittently targeted government forces, though the vast majority of these attacks are ineffective. Pro-Assad groups lack unity and widespread public support. Many Alawites do not support Assad’s return. The YPG has better positioned itself as the defender of the Kurdish people over the last decade and may have greater support relative to pro-Assad groups. The YPG is also a relatively unified organization.\n3. [Newsroom] \n\nEither of the two above scenarios could contribute to a most dangerous course of action in which either Shara or Abdi decides that neither party can move forward with a peaceful agreement to integrate the SDF. A scenario in which Syrian government forces advance into Kurdish areas and confront both Kurdish fighters and civilians could lead to another catastrophic round of communal-based violence. This scenario would also make it extraordinarily difficult for the US forces present in Syria to successfully move ISIS detainees from Syria to Iraq and increase force protection requirements for US forces.\n\nShara is likely meeting with Kurdish officials from northern Syria in an effort to prevent or mitigate widespread fighting from breaking out between government forces and Kurdish fighters or civilians who are not aligned with the YPG. Shara met with 15 Kurdish notables and community figures from Kobani in Tabqa, Raqqa Province, on an unspecified date after the government seized the city on January 17, according to Kurdish sources.[34] Shara reiterated that his state would protect Kurdish rights, and the leaders reportedly left the meeting “reassured.”[35] Some of the Kurdish community figures that Shara met with are close to the SDF leadership, while other figures present at the meeting oppose the SDF.[36] Syrian government forces have surrounded Kobani since January 19 and have continued to engage SDF-affiliated fighters in the Kobani countryside each day, which has increased the risk of violence between the majority Arab Syrian army forces, local Arab tribes, remaining SDF-affiliated fighters, and Kurdish civilians in the area. CTP-ISW has not observed reports that locals in Kobani have armed themselves, but the presence of government forces outside of cities with significant Kurdish populations since January 19 has led many Kurdish residents in Hasakah City, Qamishli, and the Kurdish rural areas near both cities to arm themselves and form local “popular battalions” to defend against any government incursions.[37] Residents of Kobani have described government forces’ surrounding the city as reminiscent of ISIS’s siege on Kobani in 2014, which is an analogy that may drive some residents to take action to defend the city.[38] This analogy also implicitly reinforces the idea that the YPG is the sole capable defender of the Kurdish people due to the YPG’s pivotal role in the 2014 Siege of Kobani by ISIS.\n\nShara’s outreach to Kurdish notables also likely aims to align influential figures from Kobani with the Syrian government and politically weaken the SDF- or YPG-affiliated factions that are currently fighting the government. Such an effort would be consistent with Shara’s historical strategies to co-opt other civil and military groups during the Syrian civil war as the leader of Jabhat al Nusra and later Hayat Tahrir al Sham (HTS). HTS used a combination of incentives, agreements, and repression to politically undermine factions and councils in Idlib Province and draw them into HTS’s sphere of influence between 2020 and 2024, for example.[39] Shara later employed a similar strategy to suppress the Daraa-based Eighth Brigade in April 2025 after it attempted to resist government control by first politically undermining the group in southern Daraa, which enabled Shara’s government to destroy the group without a fight.[40] Efforts to liaise with and build trust with Kurdish notables may seek to weaken the influence of Kurdish hardliners, such as some fighters and leaders within the YPG, among other influential Kurdish contingents. Shara reportedly criticized the SDF’s leadership for prioritizing territorial acquisition over Kurdish rights, which appears to be an attempt to drive a wedge between Kurdish leaders and the SDF.[41] The Syrian government has repeatedly blamed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK)-aligned leaders for subverting and delaying previous rounds of negotiations.\n\nThe Syrian government is experiencing some initial challenges in managing al Hol internally displaced persons camp (IDP), partially due to undisciplined and ineffective Ministry of Defense (MoD) units and insufficient training to control the camp. These challenges can be remedied in time, and the Syrian government appears to be learning from some mistakes and correcting its procedures accordingly. Local Syrian sources reported that some camp residents have made multiple escape attempts from al Hol camp in Hasakah Province since Syrian government forces took control of the camp from the SDF on January 20.[42] Only one of these escape attempts on January 25 succeeded, however.[43] The al Hol camp is the largest IDP camp in Syria and currently contains 14,500 Syrians, 3,700 Iraqis, and 6,000 third-country nationals, some of whom are ISIS supporters.[44] A pro-government Syrian source reported that some foreign and ”Arab” women (presumably referring to non-Syrian Arab women) attempted to escape on January 26.[45] These individuals are far more likely to be ISIS supporters compared to the camp’s 14,500 Syrians because the foreigners traveled to Syria in the middle of a brutal civil war. ISIS women in al Hol are ardent ISIS supporters who actively support the group by recruiting children and others in the camp.[46]\n\nISIS families and their supporters have attempted several escape attempts in recent days. An Egyptian member of the 82nd Division, which contains foreign fighters from al Qaeda-affiliated Ansar al Tawhid successfully smuggled Egyptian and Chechen ISIS families from the camp on January 25.[47] Syrian General Security Service (GSS) forces killed the 82nd Division member on January 26.[48] A local Syrian source reported that dozens of ISIS-affiliated families attempted a separate escape from al Hol on January 26 by cutting the camp’s perimeter fence, but GSS forces caught them before they could escape.[49] The GSS first deployed to al Hol IDP camp on January 21 after “many” detainees escaped from the camp when the MoD took control of the camp, according to the camp’s director.[50]\n\nGSS and the Syrian government appear to be learning from these early failures and near failures. The deployment of the GSS to al Hol is a positive step; the GSS is a relatively effective and well-disciplined force that has performed well in counterinsurgency efforts against Assadist insurgents in western Syria after the Defense Ministry’s forces massacred Alawites there in March 2025.[51] The GSS deployed additional forces and began monitoring the camps with drones on January 27 in response to the escape attempts by ISIS-affiliated detainees.[52] The chaotic and uncoordinated nature of the Syrian government takeover of northeastern Syria, coupled with the SDF collapse, has forced the GSS to relearn lessons that the United States and its SDF partners have previously learned. The SDF spent years developing counter-ISIS operations in al Hol, and the United States provided the SDF with intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) assets to monitor the camp, capabilities the GSS currently lacks.[53]\n\nThe Syrian government began recruiting and training internal security personnel from provinces it has seized from the SDF to bolster security in newly captured areas. The Syrian Ministry of Interior (MoI) began recruitment of GSS forces in Raqqa, Deir ez Zor, and Hasakah provinces on January 21.[54] The MoI transported the new GSS recruits to an academy in Damascus City, where they began a two-month training course on January 26. The recruits will return to their respective provinces after training.[55] The GSS deployed units to Deir ez Zor, Aleppo, and Raqqa provinces on January 19 in an effort to establish basic security in the area, which will prevent looting and other criminal activity and reduce the risk of score settling.[56]\n\nThe MoI has also begun settling the status of SDF fighters in territory the Syrian government captured from the SDF. The MoI opened centers for SDF fighters to settle their status with the Syrian government and hand over their weapons in Raqqa and Deir ez Zor provinces on January 25 and in Aleppo Province on January 27.[57] Most SDF fighters who settled their status with the government were reportedly Arabs who surrendered after the SDF’s Arab contingent collapsed during the MoD’s January 16 offensive.[58] This settlement process resembles a previously successful government program to settle the status of Assad regime conscripts, which required fighters to surrender weapons and register their details in exchange for a temporary card that allowed them to return to civilian life and provided protection from arbitrary arrest.[59] Previous Assadist conscript settlement efforts did not result in conscripts being systematically targeted after they settled their status. Former SDF fighters at settlement centers in Deir ez Zor and Raqqa provinces told pro-government media that authorities treated them well and did not harass them after they settled their status on January 27.[60]\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n1. Syrian IDP Camp Security: The Syrian government is experiencing some initial challenges in managing al Hol internally displaced persons camp (IDP), partially due to undisciplined and ineffective Defense Ministry units and insufficient training to control the camp. These challenges can be remedied in time, and the Syrian government appears to be learning from some mistakes and correcting its procedures accordingly. The chaotic and uncoordinated nature of the Syrian government takeover of northeastern Syria, coupled with the SDF collapse, has almost certainly forced the Interior Ministry to relearn lessons about guarding these facilities that the United States and its SDF partners have previously learned.\n2. Political Subversion of the SDF: The Syrian government is currently politically undermining hardline SDF and YPG positions by introducing limited Kurdish rights and conducting outreach to Kurdish notables, which is likely designed to politically subvert the SDF and YPG to prevent future military resistance. Shara has used similar strategies of political subversion to prevent possible adversaries from resisting him militarily. Shara outreach to Kurdish notables from northern Syria also likely aims prevent or mitigate widespread resistance by the SDF and YPG against government forces.\n3. Government-SDF Conflict: Pro-government Syrian media reported that the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and Syrian government reached a new “understanding” on January 27 to deploy Interior Ministry forces to Hasakah Province, which would be a tangible step towards the civil integration of the province into the Syrian state. CTP-ISW continues to assess that the SDF’s leadership may fracture over a decision to agree to Shara’s terms for the SDF to integrate into the Syrian state, which would risk instigating serious conflict between government forces and Kurdish fighters.\n4. Iranian Regime Stability: The Iranian regime’s ongoing crackdown is exacerbating the economic collapse that spurred the Winter 2026 protests. The crackdown will therefore fail to address the underlying causes of the protests and could create more grievances that drive future protests. The regime’s decision to persist with its crackdown indicates that the regime continues to fear protests and understands that protests only temporarily stopped due to the widespread securitization and fear caused by the regime’s extreme violence.\n\n## Iran\n\nThe Iranian regime announced several appointments to military and security positions on January 27, which indicates that the regime may have been dissatisfied with the incumbents’ performances during the January 2026 protests. The regime made the following appointments on January 27:\n\n- Iranian Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) head Peyman Jebelli appointed Ahmad Pahlavanian as IRIB deputy speaker and appointed former IRIB deputy speaker Ali Bakhshizadeh as an adviser.[64] Pahlavanian has previously held several media-related positions, including Qom Central Radio and Television director general. The new appointments within IRIB follow a January 18 cyberattack on IRIB that aired footage of Reza Pahlavi, son of former Iranian Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, calling on Iranian security forces to side with the public, as well as images of anti-government protests in Tehran.[65]\n- Brigadier General Hossein Maroufi was appointed as the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps’ (IRGC) Cultural, Social, and Media Affairs deputy.[62] Maroufi has an extensive military background and previously held positions within the IRGC Ground Forces in Sistan and Baluchistan, Golestan, and Kerman provinces. He also previously served as Basij deputy coordinator. The United States sanctioned Maroufi in December 2022 for his role in the regime’s violent suppression of the 2019 and 2022 protest waves.[63]\n- Brigadier General Jafar Motamed replaced Rear Admiral Mehdi Khajeh Amiri as Iran’s Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics deputy coordinator.[61] The defense ministry is responsible for foreign arms sales and defense agreements. Coordination deputies in Iran serve in a similar capacity to the chief of staff of a formation in the US military.\n\nAll three positions contribute to the regime’s ability and capacity to repress the protests, and the previous incumbents were likely involved in supporting the crackdown on the January 2026 protests. The timing of these appointments suggests that their replacement may have been related to the regime’s ongoing crackdown. It is unclear why the regime may have been dissatisfied with the incumbents, but some Iranian officials did not comply with orders to enforce the shutdown. The IranCell Communications Services Company Board of Directors replaced CEO Alireza Rafiei with Mohammad Hossein Soleimani on January 18, reportedly accusing Rafiei of “treason” after he was “delaying orders to cut connectivity.”[66]\n\n## Iraq\n\nOngoing disputes between the Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP) and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) over the presidency likely contributed to the Iraqi parliament’s postponement of its scheduled session to elect the new Iraqi president.[67] Parliament Speaker Haibat al Halbousi said on January 27 that both the KDP and the PUK submitted requests to postpone the session.[68] Halbousi added that he decided to postpone the session due to a lack of quorum.[69] At least 218 parliamentarians, or two-thirds of parliament, must be present during the session to elect the president, but only 85 attended the January 27 session.[70] The postponement comes as the KDP and its rival, the PUK, have been negotiating over which party will hold the presidency.[71]\n\nThis postponement will likely delay government formation. Parliament must elect a president via a simple majority with two-thirds of parliamentarians present by January 28, in accordance with the Iraqi constitution.[72] It is unclear when parliament will hold the next session to elect the president. The newly elected president is responsible for selecting the prime minister-designate from the largest parliamentary bloc to form a government.[73] The Shia Coordination Framework, which is the largest parliamentary bloc, nominated State of Law Coalition head and former Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki as prime minister-designate on January 24.[74] The Shia Coordination Framework is a loose coalition of Shia political parties, some of which Iran backs. Disputes between the KDP and the PUK over the presidency partly contributed to delays in government formation following the 2021 elections.[75]\n\nThree Iranian-backed Iraqi militias threatened on January 26 to retaliate if the United States attacks Iran, which is likely part of an effort to deter a potential US attack on Iran, as CTP-ISW assessed on January 26.[76] Harakat Hezbollah al Nujaba Political Bureau member Firas al Yasser told Shafaq News on January 26 that the militia is ready to respond to any US attack on Iran.[77] Likely Kataib Hezbollah front group Alwiya Waad al Haq released a statement on January 26 in which it threatened to target US embassies and interests in the region.[78] The Badr Organization’s Ideological Guidance Office also announced on January 26 its support for Iran “in the face of American-Israeli arrogance.”[79] The threats from these three Iranian-backed Iraqi militias are consistent with similar threats from other members of Iran’s Axis of Resistance, including Iran-backed Iraqi militia Kataib Hezbollah, that have threatened to intervene if the United States attacks Iran.[80] CTP-ISW assessed on January 26 that Axis of Resistance groups are likely threatening to get involved and expand a potential conflict to try to deter a US attack against Iran.[81] Iraqi groups face domestic constraints that may limit their ability to retaliate if the United States attacks Iran, however. Militia operations that trigger US action in Iraq are generally unpopular domestically, and some Iranian-backed Iraqi militias may be hesitant to intervene because of the possible repercussions on their domestic political efforts, such as the ongoing Iraqi government formation process.[82]\n\n## Syria\n\nSee topline section.\n\n## Arabian Peninsula\n\nCTP-ISW has temporarily suspended its coverage of Yemen beginning on January 9 to prioritize coverage of the protests in Iran.\n\n## Palestinian Territories & Lebanon\n\nNothing significant to report.\n\nEndnotes\n\n[1] https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/29/middleeast/iran-protests-currency-low-latam-intl[2] https://www.bonbast dot com;

Living standards are falling, and the state can no longer offer economic security in exchange for political obedience.\n\nDespite widespread unrest, the Islamic Republic remains resilient. Power is dispersed across elites and security networks, limiting the risk of internal collapse.\n\nProxy networks and military engagement continue but yield diminishing returns. External regime change is unlikely without a rare convergence of internal unrest, credible successors, and precision capabilities.\n\n---\n\nA Crisis of Survival, Not Reform\n\nIran has entered a fundamentally different phase of internal crisis. Economic collapse, social exhaustion, and strategic overextension are now interacting in ways that distinguish the current period from earlier cycles of unrest. Protests are no longer driven primarily by demands for reform or liberalisation. Instead, they reflect widespread economic distress. [Inflation has risen above 40 percent], real incomes have fallen sharply, and the currency has collapsed, with the rial trading at roughly 1.6 million to the pound as of February 2026.\n\nToday’s protests are rooted in material hardship. Falling purchasing power, food insecurity, and the steady erosion of basic living standards now shape public anger more than political ideology. Iran’s economic isolation has become structural rather than episodic, driven by sustained sanctions, financial exclusion, and a weakening state capacity to manage the economy. At the same time, the regime’s regional and nuclear strategies have failed to deliver sanctions relief or measurable economic relief. Together, these pressures point to a deeper breakdown of the post-revolutionary social contract. The state can no longer credibly offer economic security or dignity in exchange for political obedience.\n\nThese factors point toward a prolonged period of instability rather than imminent regime collapse. The Islamic Republic retains strong coercive capacity, but its ability to recover legitimacy or sustainable economic functionality is increasingly constrained.\n\nHistorical Context: Foundations of the Current Crisis\n\nThe 1979 Revolution and the Founding Bargain\n\nThe Islamic Republic emerged from the [1979 Iranian Revolution], combining nationalist, religious, and redistributive impulses. The overthrow of the Shah replaced a pro-Western monarchy with a system fusing clerical authority and republican structures. The implicit bargain offered by the new state rested on three pillars: resistance to foreign domination, social justice for the poor, and moral governance. This narrative, particularly the promise of independence from external control, underpinned regime legitimacy for decades, especially among lower income groups who benefited from subsidies, state employment, and redistribution.\n\nWar, Sanctions and the Rise of the Security State\n\nThe [1980–1988 Iran-Iraq War] entrenched militarisation and securitisation at the core of Iranian governance. Emergency rule became normalised, empowering revolutionary institutions while sidelining civilian authority. Over time, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) evolved from a defensive force into a central political and economic actor. Sanctions and financial exclusion shifted from episodic pressure to permanent conditions, reinforcing this trajectory. Security linked networks expanded into construction, energy, logistics, and finance, creating a rent based political economy that rewards loyalty, limits competition, and entrenches regime resilience.\n\nThe JCPOA and the Closing of the Reform Window\n\nThe 2015 nuclear agreement, known as the [Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action] (JCPOA), briefly reopened the possibility of economic reintegration. Sanctions relief supported modest growth and raised expectations, particularly in urban Iran. In 2018, the U.S. withdrew from the deal, citing concerns over Iran’s missile programme, regional influence, and the temporary nature of some nuclear restrictions. The withdrawal ended sanctions relief and undermined reformist strategies, reinforcing elite scepticism about engagement with the West. The collapse of the agreement accelerated capital flight, currency devaluation, and elite consolidation around hardline narratives that resistance is essential for regime survival. As sanctions returned and economic conditions deteriorated, the window for meaningful reform closed decisively.\n\nPower Structure and Regime Resilience\n\nIran’s stability is shaped by a complex distribution of power. At the top, the Supreme Leader acts as an arbiter among competing elites rather than a direct policy manager. Below this, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps operates as both a coercive force and an economic actor with vested interests in maintaining the system under sanctions.\n\nElected institutions retain administrative responsibility but have limited strategic autonomy. Civilian governments manage decline rather than drive recovery. This fragmentation strengthens regime resilience: no single faction is fully responsible for failures, and dissent can be channelled, suppressed, or absorbed. Internal rivalries exist, but they are mediated within the system rather than threatening it. There is no unified elite bloc pushing for systemic transformation, only tactical disagreements over how best to ensure survival.\n\nWhy This Protest Wave Is Different\n\nEarlier protest movements in Iran were largely urban and middle class, centred on political rights, cultural freedoms and electoral grievances. These movements were largely contained through selective repression without destabilising the broader system.\n\nThe current unrest is driven by material hardship. Rising inflation, food insecurity, and currency collapse have pushed large segments of the population into subsistence conditions. The poorest and most peripheral communities are now among the most affected. Purchasing power has fallen sharply, savings have evaporated, and state subsidies no longer offset basic costs.\n\nThis shift has strategic significance. Poverty-driven unrest is harder to suppress because it is continuous rather than episodic. Economic distress does not require mobilisation, leadership, or ideology. It spreads through prices, wages, and household stress. While political dissent may be fragmented, material deprivation continues to grow.\n\nIran as a Pariah Economy\n\nIran’s exclusion from the global economy is now embedded rather than reversible in the short term. Comprehensive sanctions, financial de-risking and IRGC designation have severed access to banking, insurance and investment networks. Oil exports continue through opaque channels, relying on deep discounts and intermediaries, creating a dual economy. A shadow system benefits connected elites and security-linked firms, while the wider population bears the cost of inflation and scarcity. Economic exclusion has shifted from a pressure mechanism to structural stagnation. Sanctions have not toppled the regime, but they have weakened state capacity. Infrastructure investment has stalled and human capital is leaving. The economy now sustains the regime but not society.\n\nIran’s regional posture is also under strain. Proxy networks that once extended influence now impose costs. Hezbollah is constrained by Lebanon’s economic collapse. The Gaza conflict has exposed the limits of proxy deterrence. Yemen continues to drain resources without delivering strategic outcomes. At the same time, the nuclear strategy has increased military exposure without achieving sanctions relief. Intelligence penetration by Israel and the United States has highlighted regime vulnerabilities and reduced deterrent ambiguity. Iran retains disruptive capacity, but its ability to translate regional activity into strategic gain is declining. Iran’s capacity to project influence externally appears increasingly constrained by internal pressures, even as it maintains proxy networks.\n\nAppetite for Regime Change Inside and Outside Iran\n\nInternally, there is widespread dissatisfaction but limited unity in revolutionary risk. Many Iranians seek relief over rupture and the memory of regional state collapse acts as a deterrent. Protesters express rejection of the current system but are not united around an alternative political project. Externally, there is no coordinated effort to pursue regime change. Western governments prioritise containment over transformation. Regional actors hedge rather than confront and there is no credible successor structure or opposition coalition to engage. The regime endures because alternatives are undefined and risks are high.\n\nWhile the [United States has deployed military assets] and signalled pressure on Iran, any attempt at coercive regime change would be far more challenging than recent operations elsewhere, such as in Venezuela. Iran’s defensive capabilities, geographic depth, and domestic support make intervention costly and unpredictable. Public opinion in the United States also shows limited appetite for another Middle East conflict, and there is no clear plan for governance should the regime be disrupted. External regime change could become conceivable only if several difficult conditions align: sustained internal unrest with elite defections, a clear successor authority ready to govern, and the capability to conduct precise, intelligence-led operations that degrade regime control without triggering significant civilian harm or a power vacuum. At present, none of these conditions are close to being met. Such an outcome remains hypothetical and would require a rare alignment of internal and external factors. As a result, external coercive change remains unlikely in the near term, with Western policy focusing instead on containment, sanctions, and diplomacy.\n\nOutlook\n\nIran is likely to experience continued cycles of protest and suppression, accompanied by gradual economic decline. Living standards will deteriorate further as inflation remains high and the currency stays unstable. The regime is more likely to survive as a crisis manager than to recover as a developmental state.\n\nPossible Scenarios:\n\nProlonged Managed Decline: The baseline scenario is a state strong enough to suppress unrest but too weak to deliver major improvements. This carries persistent risks for regional security and global energy markets, which remain sensitive to volatility linked to Iranian instability.\n\nLimited Elite Reforms: Under internal pressure, elite reshuffles or incremental economic adjustments may occur. These changes would be tactical rather than structural, unlikely to restore broad economic confidence, but could temporarily ease some pressures.\n\nEscalation and Miscalculation: Sustained internal pressures may prompt the regime to take limited external actions to shore up domestic legitimacy. Even contained escalation could heighten regional insecurity and energy price volatility, underscoring the persistent risks of miscalculation.\n\nImplications for the International System\n\nIran is likely to remain a persistent source of regional risk. Proxy conflicts will continue alongside deeper militarisation. Energy markets remain exposed to geopolitical shocks, reflecting the country’s enduring influence. Bilateral ties with China and Russia are expected to persist, providing Iran with diplomatic cover and limited economic engagement, though these are unlikely to address core structural weaknesses.\n\nWestern policy faces a dilemma: to continue relying on sanctions and containment without effective tools to incentivise systemic reform. Iran’s persistence as a weakened but enduring state will shape Middle Eastern geopolitics, challenging conventional approaches to risk management and strategic planning.\n\nConclusion: A Regime That Can Endure but Cannot Recover\n\nThe Islamic Republic is unlikely to fall in the near term, and equally unlikely to restore economic viability or legitimacy. Entering a prolonged phase of managed decline, Iran’s future will be defined by how long a weakened state can govern a society it can no longer provide for, and how much instability the international system will tolerate. For businesses, policymakers, and investors, this means operating with a stable but structurally fragile Iran, where risks are persistent, and opportunities remain constrained.\n\n---\n\n[Bree Stewart] \n\n## Washington’s Return: The Strategic Stakes of U.S. Monetary Support to Argentina\n\n[Next]"

U.S. President Donald Trump has been posting increasingly [direct threats] on social media, and administration officials are [leaking] copiously about their preparations. Trump appears to be overly impressed by his supposed success in Venezuela and by U.S. airstrikes last year on Iran and has always been contemptuous of experts warning of risks and consequences.

It’s only partly about the protests. Israel has been agitating for another round of military action against Iran’s nuclear program—Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [pressed] the case with Trump during his late December meeting. But the protests, and Iran’s predictably violent repression, offer up an opportunity to act on a long-standing policy demand. Regime change in Iran has been the ultimate goal of American and Israeli hawks for decades.

Regime change in Iran has been the ultimate goal of American and Israeli hawks for decades. Many people have talked themselves into the [idea] that the protests have Iran’s regime on the ropes, and that it would take just a little military nudge to push it over the brink.\n\nIt’s not about promoting democracy in Iran, of course. I think we can all see exactly what Trump thinks of democracy from his actions at home and across the globe (from Venezuela to Ukraine to Denmark to the EU to Gaza). Iranians in the streets may want democracy and certainly want more than the imposition of a pro-American dictator. But Trump has no real concern for what they want, and neither do the many hawks who loudly protest their eternal love and support for the Iranian people. No matter how furious Iranians are with the Islamic Republic, a new Iranian leader arriving on the backs of American bombers will find little love among a fiercely nationalist Iranian public.\n\nWhat kind of bombing might we expect? American and Israeli hawks dream of a Hezbollah-style decapitation strike that eliminates Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the senior leadership of the Islamic Republic and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). But the success of that Israeli attack in 2024, which [killed] Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, is less likely to be replicated in Tehran. Iranian leaders are fully aware of the potential for such a strike. They have spent the last six months [rooting out] real and imagined spies and potential informants, and are unlikely to offer up an opportunity for a clean kill shot. Even if it somehow succeeded (and Israeli intelligence penetration of Iran should not be underestimated), the most likely post-Khamenei successor regime would be led by the IRGC and hard-line security forces.\n\nMuch more likely is a short to medium-length campaign to degrade the capabilities of the IRGC and the paramilitary Basij force in order to reduce the repressive capacity of the Iranian state and create an opening for protesters to overwhelm the remaining regime forces. That wouldn’t be as easy in reality as it is on social media. Regime security forces tend to be deployed where the protesters are these days. Bombing security forces will necessarily kill many protesters and scatter the rest for fear of being targeted. Another bombing run against nuclear sites may serve counterproliferation goals but won’t do much to embolden protesters. Given the tendency of Iranians to rally around the flag when bombed by the United States and Israel, the most likely [effect] of a non-decapitation bombing campaign would be to taper off the protests and ultimately end them.\n\nThere are also logistical issues with a sustained bombing campaign. Most American military assets are currently deployed in the Caribbean for the quixotic Venezuela campaign, leaving U.S. capabilities in the Gulf at their lowest ebb in a very long time. Supplies of missile interceptors and smart bombs are [reportedly running low]. And Iran is unlikely to just sit back and take it, raising the risks of a regionwide conflagration at the heart of the world’s oil production.\n\nNor are the Gulf states likely to take up the slack. They are, for the most part, pining for stability, not a conflict that could trigger state failure, refugee flows, and retaliatory attacks across the Gulf. Saudi Arabia and Qatar have both [come out] against an American attack on Iran. Riyadh shows none of the bloodlust for regime change in Iran that marked the early days of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s tenure in de facto power. The rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iran [brokered] under Chinese auspices a few years ago continues to hold, grounded in Saudi interests in maintaining a reasonably stable environment for economic development. That’s intensified by increasingly clear Saudi concerns about an Israel unbound, not only in Gaza but in military strikes across the region. The sharp Saudi turn [against] the United Arab Emirates over the last month and active formation of a [new military alliance] encompassing Turkey, Pakistan, Egypt, and some Arab states are clearly meant to balance against this perceived Israeli threat—which an attack on Iran would only exacerbate.\n\nU.S. military action right now is unlikely to topple the Iranian regime and unlikely to protect Iranian civilians. Even if Trump’s run of good luck in his foreign-policy gambles continues and the worst potential repercussions are avoided, the strikes will likely have only a marginal direct effect. They will increase Gulf fears of Israeli expansionism, delegitimize and demobilize the protesters confronting the regime, and further normalize episodic military action without legal justification. They may also undermine global support for the sanctions that, for all the human misery they have caused, have also been a primary driver of the economic failures and state capacity degradation that triggered the protests in the first place.\n\nThis post is part of FP’s ongoing coverage of the Trump administration.
